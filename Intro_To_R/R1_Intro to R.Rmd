# R1: Introduction to R and R Studio   

### NICAR2020, New Orleans    



![](Images/UARK logo NEW.png)

#  Orientation to R Studio  

- **There are four main windows:**
    
    Script writing, R Markdown, Table Viewer: Upper Left   
    Environment - data loaded in R: Upper Right    
    Console - write commands in R: Lower Left   
    File Manager and Html table viewer: Bottom Right    

# Part 1: Install software, Grab data

- **tidyverse** installs 8 separate software packages to perform
data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming
install.packages("tidyverse")

- **Rio package**: easy importing features and janitor for data cleaning  
install.packages("rio")   
install.packages("janitor")  

After you install a package on your hard drive, you can call it back up by summoning a library 

Libraries are bits of software you will have to load each time into R to make things run. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(janitor)
```

- **Tip**: Check to see  what's installed by clicking on "Packages" tab in File Manager, lower right pane

#  Part 2: Examine Data

- **Open this file in Excel:**

https://github.com/profrobwells/Guest_Lectures/blob/master/Intro_To_R/RealMediaSalariesCleaned.xlsx

- **Select RealMediaSalaries2 tab**

IRE Old School: Four Corners Test!   

    13 Columns   
    1658 Rows 
    Numberic data in Salary, Years Experience
    Mixed string data in Gender Identity / Ethnicity, Job duties


-- **Import Data**  

```{r}
MediaBucks <- rio::import("https://github.com/profrobwells/Guest_Lectures/blob/master/Intro_To_R/RealMediaSalariesCleaned.xlsx?raw=true", which = "RealMediaSalaries2")
```

What happened? Look at the table
```{r}
View(MediaBucks)
```

What happened?

    R grabbed the spreadsheet from the folder  
    We told R to grab the first sheet, RealMediaSalaries2 
    R created a dataframe called MediaBucks   
    
Basics of R: <- is known as an “assignment operator.”  

    It means: “Make the object named to the left equal to the output of the code to the right.”


#  Part 3: Explore Data

-- **How many rows?**   
```{r}
nrow(MediaBucks)
```

-- **How many columns?**  
```{r}
ncol(MediaBucks)
```

-- **Names of your columns**  
```{r}
colnames(MediaBucks)
```

OR: names(MediaBucks)

-- **Check data types**
```{r}
str(MediaBucks)
```

- **Let's look at the first six rows**
```{r}
head(MediaBucks)
```

- **Here is a quick way to view the range of your data on just salary column**    
```{r}
summary(MediaBucks$Salary)
```

- **Size and scope**
```{r}
sum(MediaBucks$Salary, na.rm=TRUE)
```
$106 million! for 1,658 journalists

Context:
NYT earnings in 2018 = $126m in 2018
Facebook earnings for two days: $135 million (Q32019=$6.1B)

- **average**
```{r}
mean(MediaBucks$Salary, na.rm=TRUE)
```

- **Distribution by Quantile**
```{r}
quantile(MediaBucks$Salary, c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9), na.rm=TRUE)
```

-- **Navigation Tips**   

    Shortcut Commands
    Tab - Autocomplete
    In Console Window (lower left) 
    Control (or Command) + UP arrow - last lines run
    Control (or Command) + Enter - Runs current or selected lines of code in the top left box of RStudio
    Shift + Control (or Command) +P - Reruns previous region code

# Part 4: dplyr

- **dplyr has many tools for data analysis**     

    select Choose which columns to include.
    filter Filter the data.
    arrange Sort the data, by size for continuous variables, by date, or alphabetically.
    group_by Group the data by a categorical variable.

- **Build a simple summary table by Gender**  

```{r}
Summary <- MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Gender, Salary) %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  summarize(Total = sum(Salary, na.rm=TRUE))
```

- **What is the sample size?**
```{r}
Gender <- MediaBucks %>% 
  count(Gender) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

- **Better idea: Check Averages!**

    Build a simple summary table by Gender
    
```{r}    
Summary <- MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Gender, Salary) %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  summarize(Avg_Salary = mean(Salary, na.rm=TRUE))
```

- **Quick filter out hourly workers**  

```{r}
MediaSalary <- MediaBucks %>% 
  filter(Salary >= 1000)
```

- **Questions**

    1: View the range of your data  
    2: Number of rows
    3: Number of rows cut with hourly filter

- **Answer: #1**
```{r}
summary(MediaSalary$Salary)
```

- **Answer: #2**
```{r}
nrow(MediaSalary)
```

- **Answer: #3**
```{r}
nrow(MediaBucks)-nrow(MediaSalary)
```

- **Find Your News Organization**

Use a Filter
```{r}
WSJ <- subset(MediaBucks, COMPANY=="WallStreetJournal")  
summary(WSJ$Salary)
```

- **Search Using Wildcards**  

```{r}
Journal <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?Journal", COMPANY))
Bloom <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?Bloomberg", COMPANY))
```

- **Questions**  
  
    1: Build a table for NewYorkTimes employees
    2: Determine median salary of NewYorkTimes employees
    3: Identify title, gender and race of the highest paid position at NYT'
    4: Search for "Business" in Company, check salaries, compare to "Bloomberg"

- **Answers:**

- **1: Build a table for NewYorkTimes employees**
```{r}
NYT <- subset(MediaBucks, COMPANY=="NewYorkTimes") 
```

- **2: Determine median salary of NewYorkTimes employees**
```{r}
summary(NYT$Salary)
```

- **#3: Identify title, gender and race of the highest paid position at NYT**
```{r}
NYT %>% 
  filter(Salary == 350000)
```


- **4: Search for "Business" in Company, check median salaries, compare to "Bloomberg"**

```{r}
Biz <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?Business", COMPANY))
summary(Biz$Salary)
```
$46,000
```{r}
Bloom <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?Bloomberg", COMPANY))
summary(Bloom$Salary)
```
$50,350

# Part 5: More Tables

- **Build a table with several companies of your choice**
```{r}
BigBoys <- filter(MediaSalary, COMPANY %in% c("NewYorkTimes", "WallStreetJournal", "Bloomberg"))    
```

- **Table with just reporter salaries**
```{r}
Reporters <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?reporter", TITLE))
summary(Reporters$Salary)
```

- **Questions:**
    
    1: Who is making $230,504 as a reporter???
    2: Make a table for editors, figure out medians.
    3: Find highest paid editor. Resent them.
    4: Make a table for any position involving data


- **Answers:**

- **1: Who is making $230,504 as a reporter???**
```{r}
Reporters %>% 
  filter(Salary == 230504)
```

- **#2: Make a table for editors, figure out medians.**

```{r}
Editors <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?editor", TITLE))
summary(Editors$Salary)
```

-**#3: Find highest paid editor. Resent them.**
```{r}
Editors %>% 
  filter(Salary == 245000)
```

-**#4: Make a table for any position involving data**
```{r}
Data <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl(("?Data"), TITLE))
summary(Data$Salary)
```


# Part 6: Chart By Gender

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% ggplot(aes(y = Salary, x=Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Total Media Salaries by Gender", 
       subtitle = "Source: RealMediaSalaries survey, 2019 ",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells",
       x="County",
       y="Salary")
```
This needs some work

- **Get rid of scientific notation**
```{r}
options("scipen"=100, "digits"=4)
```

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% ggplot(aes(y = Salary, x=Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(title = "Total Media Salaries by Gender", 
       subtitle = "Source: RealMediaSalaries survey, 2019 ",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells",
       x="County",
       y="Salary")
```

- **Add Color**
```{r}
MediaBucks %>% ggplot(aes(y = Salary, x=Gender, color = Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  #coord_flip() +     #this makes it a horizontal bar chart instead of vertical
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(title = "Total Media Salaries by Gender", 
       subtitle = "Source: RealMediaSalaries survey, 2019 ",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells",
       x="County",
       y="Salary")
```

- **Average salaries is the story!**
```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Gender, Salary) %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(Salary, na.rm=TRUE))  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = mean, x=Gender, color = Gender, fill=Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(title = "Average Media Salaries by Gender", 
       subtitle = "Source: RealMediaSalaries survey, 2019 ",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells",
       x="County",
       y="Salary")
```
