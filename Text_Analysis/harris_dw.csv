The New York Times warned on Friday that Vice President Kamala Harris may be in trouble after its latest poll found her tied nationally with former President Donald Trump. The Times and Siena College poll of 2,516 likely voters from October 20-23 found Harris and Trump tied at 48% as Americans remain pessimistic about the state of the country. The poll brought the RealClearPolitics average of the contest between Harris and Trump to a tie at 48.5%. “The result, coming less than two weeks before Election Day, and as millions of Americans have already voted, is not encouraging for Ms. Harris,” the Times wrote of its most recent poll, adding, “[Democrats] have been looking to Ms. Harris to build a strong national lead as a sign that she would do well in such critical swing states as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.” One of the troubling signs was that only 28% of those surveyed believed that the country was headed in the right direction. “And voters continue to be pessimistic about the direction of the country, a measure that historically has been a danger sign for the party in power,” the outlet noted. The Times said that Harris appears to have weakened among likely voters since its last poll. “Ms. Harris’s position, if anything, may have declined among likely voters since the last Times/Siena College poll, taken in early October. At the time, she had a slight lead over Mr. Trump, 49 percent to 46 percent. The change is within the margin of error, but The Times’s national polling average has registered a tightening in polls over the past few weeks as well, suggesting at the very least that this contest has drawn even closer.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 The top issues for the voters were the economy (27%), immigration (15%), and abortion (15%). On Those issues, Trump was trusted more on the economy (52%-45%) and immigration (54%-43%) while Harris was trusted more on abortion (55%-40%). “I was very, extremely disappointed in her response to our immigration issue,” 27-year-old Larrissa Alexander told the Times. “And when she was first elected, that was one of the things that she was tasked with handling. And she accepted that responsibility. And then every time she was asked about it or pressed about it, it just was attitude-giving in return.” The poll found a large gap between male and female support for both Trump and Harris. Among men surveyed, Trump led 55%-41% while Harris led women 54%-42%. Already have an account? Your information could be the missing piece to an important story.

O'Leary said. A CNN panel exploded when “Shark Tank’s” Kevin O’Leary pointed out that the Democratic party did not have a nomination process and instead Vice President Kamala Harris was “chosen” by the Democratic party elites. During a CNN panel about Harris’ dismal performance in the CNN Town Hall, O’Leary brought up how the party in 2016 picked then-Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton over presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who appeared to have more energy and support from their base. “Only 90 days ago, Pelosi went to Biden and said, ‘You need to step aside,’ and convinced him to do so,” O’Leary said. “He did actually ask her, we’ve now learned this, ‘Is she[ Harris] the right person to drive this home?’” “He questioned that,” he added. “He could’ve said, ‘We need to run a process in order for me to make this move,’ but they decided not to. I don’t know who they is? Was it Obama, was it Pelosi? I don’t care who it was.” NEW: CNN panel explodes into chaos when @kevinolearytv dares to point out that Kamala was not elected to the party’s nomination, and was “chosen” by Pelosi and Dem party elites.

CNN host Abby Phillip hit back and said, “Hillary Clinton won a primary. She won a primary. You might not like how the primary … she won a primary. First of all, that’s the first thing.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 However, when O’Leary asked, “Did Kamala Harris win a primary?,” none of the CNN hosts wanted to answer him. “Listen, we have talked about this before,” Phillip replied. “It’s not in the Constitution. The political parties can choose however they want to choose their nominee. And as long as they meet the legal deadline, in the states where they are on the ballot, they can do it.” Phillip said that the party can “decide in December of 2023 to just handpick someone. You don’t have to have a primary. It’s just not a thing. … You’re describing something as undemocratic that has absolutely nothing to do with the Democratic process.” “Do you think that’s really what matters to voters?” another CNN contributor interjected. “Your whole shtick is, let’s talk about what matters to voters. Do you really think voters care about the intranessine primary process of the Democrat Party?” “If you are a Democrat, you sure as hell care today,” O’Leary replied.

A federal judge sided with the Biden-Harris administration on Friday in ruling that Virginia must put non-citizen immigrants back on its voter rolls after they were removed by the state in compliance with state law. U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles, who was appointed by the Biden-Harris administration, ordered that Virginia must put the non-citizens back on the voter rolls, even though it is illegal for them to vote. “Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals–who self-identified themselves as noncitizens–back onto the voter rolls,” said Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. “Almost all these individuals had previously presented immigration documents confirming their noncitizen status, a fact recently verified by federal authorities.” Youngkin noted that the law, passed in 2006, was signed by then-Governor Tim Kaine, a Democrat. The law “mandates certain procedures to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls, with safeguards in place to affirm citizenship before removal–and the ultimate failsafe of same-day registration for U.S. citizens to cast a provisional ballot,” Youngkin said. “This law has been applied in every Presidential election by Republicans and Democrats since enacted 18 years ago.” Youngkin said that the state would immediately file a petition with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court, for an emergency stay of the injunction. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called Giles’ ruling “a totally unacceptable travesty” and announced that he would now host a rally in the state before Election Day. “Sleepy Joe Biden and Comrade Kamala Harris ridiculously accuse me of wanting to ‘weaponize’ the Justice Department, when they have done all of the weaponizing,” Trump wrote. “Now, their truly Weaponized Department of ‘Injustice,’ and a Judge (appointed by Joe), have ORDERED the Great Commonwealth of Virginia to PUT NON-CITIZEN VOTERS BACK ON THE ROLLS.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 “This is a totally unacceptable travesty, and Governor Youngkin is absolutely right to appeal this ILLEGAL ORDER, and the U.S. Supreme Court will hopefully fix it!” he added. “Only U.S. Citizens should be allowed to vote.

MSNBC anchor Alex Wagner was clearly shocked by the brutal responses from black voters in Philadelphia when it came to why they were supporting former President Donald Trump instead of Vice President Kamala Harris. In the clip that aired on the network, Wagner sat down and talked to the voters in a blue county of the swing state of Pennsylvania who explained why they couldn’t support the Democratic candidate, with answers ranging from her not having enough experience to not being the right personality to be the leader of the free world. “She’s a woman of color. I’m not putting her down because of that,” one woman said. “I’m not putting her down because she’s a woman … but at the end of the day, I don’t think that [Kamala] has the personality.” “We all know she’s not black” – Surprised MSNBC aired this one. pic.twitter.com/U7mK7lofUO — Christy Kelly (@Kelly4Humanity) October 23, 2024 “I don’t think that she has what it takes to go up against Putin and go up against these other presidents that are built for this,” she added. “I don’t want to be scared because my president’s scared, I want my president to feel secure, and manly, and about it.” When asked if it was because Harris is a woman that she wasn’t supporting her, another woman said no — she just doesn’t “have the qualification or the education to really run America. Because she don’t have the experience. She don’t understand our struggles. And for me to believe you for another four years, you’re crazy. Like, you’re crazy. You’re saying the same thing that you said four years ago.” A third woman said, “The first time I heard the name Kamala Harris, it was in association to locking up parents for truancy … I really didn’t understand how this person claims to be a black woman, but yet she’s locking up black women and black men and separating families.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Another voter was asked about Trump’s comments earlier in the campaign about how Harris previously embraced her Indian heritage before she embraced being black. “Absolutely! She’s sworn into the Senate, it was the first Indian American … and that’s fine, we don’t care,” one woman said. Another woman interjected, “We all know that she’s not black, let’s understand that. … But my point of view is, she’s already been there. She’s in office right now.” Later, a group voters explained why they were definitely pulling the lever for Trump. “For me, it’s immigration. I myself come from an immigrant family. I’m Guatemalan,” one person said. “And for us, seeing the new immigrants come in, they’re more violent, it’s more chaos.” “And we’ve been here for longer than them, and it’s starting to affect us more because stuff is getting stolen,” he added. “They’re making us look bad as immigrants and we’ve been here longer than them. And we’re getting more misrepresentation because of them.” Another person said they were voting for Trump “unequivocally, period. No one else is going to persuade us.

"6","https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-kamala-granting-quiet-amnesty-to-huge-number-of-illegals-report","Biden, Kamala Granting ‘Quiet Amnesty’ To Huge Number Of Illegals: Report","Nearly 1 million illegals have been given effective amnesty, per the report A new report from the House Judiciary Committee says the Biden-Harris administration is exploiting immigration court proceedings to grant de facto amnesty to nearly 1 million illegal immigrants. Under Biden and Harris, there have been more than 10.3 million illegal entries into the U.S., with an additional 2 million+ “gotaways,” which represent the number of times someone has been observed crossing over the border illegally, without apprehension. “Through administrative maneuvering, the Biden-Harris Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security have caused the immigration court backlog to skyrocket, adding over 3.7 million new cases since fiscal year 2021,” a press release from the committee said. “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, over 700,000 illegal aliens have had their cases dismissed, terminated, or administratively closed, and the pace of these actions has increased each year, allowing those aliens to stay in the country indefinitely without facing immigration consequences,” the committee explained. In such cases, the committee said, the illegal is granted permission to stay in the U.S. “indefinitely.” In addition to those 700,000 illegals, more than 109,000 illegals did not have their cases adjudicated in Fiscal Year 2023, but the cases were closed out, Fox News highlighted. Lastly, the Department of Homeland Security has not filed the necessary documentation for another 200,000 cases; those illegals, too, can remain in the U.S. indefinitely. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 “The Biden-Harris Administration has used the backlog as an excuse to allow even more aliens to remain in America,” the committee said. “Instead of adjudicating cases based on the merits of their claims—such as valid asylum requests—immigration judges have rubberstamped dismissals, terminations, and closures. This quiet amnesty has become a hallmark of the Biden-Harris Administration’s immigration courts.” Moreover, due to the lack of vetting at the border, criminals have been permitted to enter the U.S. For example, at least 382 people on the terror watch list have entered the U.S. since 2021, which is a 3,000% increase compared to former President Donald Trump’s tenure. Additionally, border agents have reportedly encountered more than 1.7 million migrants known as “special interest aliens.” According to a House Judiciary Committee report, an “SIA” is a migrant who comes from a country that poses a national security threat to the U.S., such as Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, and Turkey. Back in 2019, the DHS defined an SIA as a “non-U.S. person who, based on an analysis of travel patterns, potentially poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests.” Notably, U.S. officials are also not given the criminal records of migrants from numerous countries, such as Venezuela, Cuba, and China, leaving border agents in the dark and Americans at risk.

"7","https://www.dailywire.com/news/non-citizen-illegal-alien-voting-could-deliver-key-swing-states-to-harris-study-finds","Non-Citizen, Illegal Alien Voting Could Deliver Key Swing States To Harris, Study Finds","The number of non-citizens eclipse the 2020 margin of victory in 12 different states, including Arizona and Georgia. If a significant number of illegal aliens and other non-citizens manage to vote in the upcoming election, the voting bloc could flip swing states in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris and deliver victory to the Democratic candidate, a new study reveals. The report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) found that the number of voting age citizens in certain key swing states outnumbers the margins of victory in the 2020 election, indicating that non-citizens could materially change the outcome of the November 5th election if they are able to vote in significant numbers in violation of the law. “Census Bureau data collected earlier this year indicates that there are 23.2 million voting-age non-citizens in the country, roughly half of whom are illegal immigrants,” CIS states. “Our analysis does show that in a dozen states, plus the Nebraska 2nd district, the non-citizen population in 2024 is potentially large enough to exceed the state winner’s margin in 2020.” “Mathematically, there are 12 states, plus the Nebraska 2nd congressional district, where the voting-age non-citizen population is larger in 2024 than the state winner’s margin of victory in the last presidential election,” CIS reported before highlighting specific swing states that could be most impacted by illegal immigrant and other non-citizen voting. There are 12 states, plus the Nebraska 2nd congressional district, where the voting-age non-citizen population is larger in 2024 than the state winner’s margin of victory in the last presidential election. Full report: https://t.co/RtB6NDBkBF pic.twitter.com/HQK7UEIdgm — Center for Immigration Studies (@CIS_org) October 23, 2024 Less than two percent of the non-citizen populations of Arizona and Georgia would need to vote in each state in order to equal the margins of victory in the 2020 election, the study found. The two states, which together have 27 electoral votes, are both crucial swing states that will have an outsized role in deciding the winner of the presidential contest. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 A larger share of non-citizens would have to vote in other key swing states in order to eclipse the 2020 margin of victory, however. In North Carolina, 10.26 percent of non-citizens would have to vote, while over 15 percent would have to vote in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Existing data indicates that non-citizen voting would likely be a boon for Harris, giving her an advantage over former President Donald Trump. About two-thirds of foreign-born citizens favored the Democrats over the Republicans in the 2016 election. “Assuming non-citizens would have the same voting preferences as naturalized citizens in 2016, then it would require 4.49 percent of non-citizens to vote in Georgia and 5.13 percent to vote in Arizona in 2024 for the net gain in votes for Harris to exceed the margin of victory in the last presidential election,” CIS explained. Some recent data, however, indicates that Harris holds a more modest 20 point advantage over Trump. Leftwing organizations and donors appear to agree that bringing in large numbers of immigrants and allowing them to vote would help the Democratic Party. The analysis from CIS comes as a recent investigation from The Daily Wire found that far-Left organizations funded by Democratic mega donor George Soros have naturalized citizens in order to turn them into voters, saying the plan could “sway the outcome” of national elections. The role of mass immigration on American elections has come into sharp focus this year, with conservative figures warning of its long-term implications. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) alleged that Harris supports mass immigration because it will shift America “dramatically to the left,” allowing Democrats to “win every election forever.” Elon Musk has similarly warned that illegal immigration bolsters the population figures of liberal sanctuary states and cities, resulting in the areas receiving a higher number of Congressional districts. Any legislation that provides amnesty for illegal aliens could have an even more drastic impact on the fate of American elections. Over 10 million people have crossed the border under the Biden-Harris administration, with an estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrant gotaways recorded since the two took office in January 2021. In the final days of the race, the Harris campaign has even run an advertisement that claims Democrats are the party of border security, featuring an image of former president Donald Trump’s border wall.

"8","https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamalas-desperate-final-plea-vote-for-me-or-youre-sexist","Kamala’s Desperate Final Plea: ‘Vote For Me Or You’re Sexist’","This is like a parody of how to finish a campaign when you're trying to elect the first woman president. We all remember that Election Night four years ago actually lasted a lot longer than one night. It stretched on for several days. And with each hour that passed — particularly in the overnight hours — Donald Trump’s lead slowly trickled away, until finally, the media declared Joe Biden had emerged victorious. What followed was widespread suspicion of election fraud, January 6, a lot of lawsuits, and so on. Whatever you think of the results themselves, this was a clear failure of our government. Their job is to ensure that elections are beyond reproach. The appearance of fairness is almost as important as actual fairness and that clearly didn’t happen four years ago. To quell the outrage that unfolded after the race was called for Joe Biden, Democrats came up with an explanation for what had occurred. They stated it was completely foreseeable that Donald Trump’s lead would dissipate, then vanish over several days. And the reason they said it made sense is that, in key states like Pennsylvania, all of the votes weren’t counted on Election Day. They told us that, as counties east of the Appalachian Mountains reported their results, it was only natural for Joe Biden’s lead to continue to grow. Democrats said there was no cause for alarm here, because when you look at the demographics of the late-reporting counties, it all makes sense. Those counties included cities like Philadelphia and Atlanta, which have very large black populations. And black voters, in every presidential election in memory, have always turned out in very large numbers for the Democrat. Therefore, they said, there’s nothing to see here. There’s no fraud. This is the expected result. That’s the excuse they went with, and a lot of Republicans bought it. As we head into the final days of the 2024 presidential election, it’s becoming clear this excuse probably won’t work this time around. They won’t be able to say, with a straight face, that late-reporting counties in majority-black areas all broke for Kamala Harris by 90% at the last minute. That’s because Kamala Harris’ support among black voters, according to every major poll, is collapsing. Everyone admits this is happening — even CNN. Watch: To be as fair as possible to Kamala Harris, her support is dropping among a lot of demographic groups. It’s not just black voters. The New York Times just reported: Vice President Kamala Harris’s support among Hispanic voters is in dangerously low territory for Democrats … More than one-third of Hispanic voters say they support both building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting immigrants who are living in the United States illegally. But interestingly enough, you’ll notice that the Harris campaign isn’t going on the offensive against Hispanics. They’re not lecturing Hispanics about how they’re racists and misogynists. CNN isn’t freaking out either. Instead, the Kamala Harris campaign, their surrogates, and their allies in the media, have all united to go after black voters specifically. This has been going on for some time now. A few weeks ago, I talked about Barack Obama’s literal finger-wag at black men. He showed up at Kamala Harris’ campaign headquarters and told black voters that, if they’re hesitating about supporting Kamala Harris, then they probably hate women. Here’s part of what he said, one more time: This is the kind of outburst that, if you’re being charitable, you might chalk up to a bad day. Maybe the kite-surfing wasn’t great on Martha’s Vineyard that day, and so Barack Obama decided to go off-script and take out his frustrations on insolent black voters who won’t do what he commands them to do. Certainly, if you’re a Kamala Harris supporter, that’s the best-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is that Barack Obama was delivering the campaign’s well-rehearsed, scripted closing argument — which is that if you’re a black guy and you don’t vote for Kamala Harris, then you’re a horrible person who hates women. If that’s the campaign’s closing argument, then they’re obviously in a lot of trouble. Unfortunately for anyone who’s pulling for Kamala, it does appear that, indeed, this is the message they’re going with. You can tell because Barack Obama isn’t the only surrogate for Kamala Harris who’s talking like this. Here for example is a Georgia “pastor” named Jamal Bryant. Kamala Harris visited his church this weekend. Watch: He’s saying that black men were misogynists because they didn’t support Stacey Abrams. And now they’re misogynists because they won’t support Kamala Harris. This is the pastor Kamala is trying to court. And just to be clear about who this pastor is and what he stands for, here’s the vision for his church he laid out in a podcast last year: This is the person Kamala is relying on to scold black men: A pastor who wants to turn his churches into marijuana farms, where they talk about sex toys. This is the quality of surrogate that she now has. And it gets even worse. CNN asked Stacey Abrams about Jamal Bryant’s comments. You see, Stacey Abrams, unlike Donald Trump, is allowed to claim that all of her election losses are illegitimate, so CNN still pretends to take her seriously. And in this interview, Abrams basically agreed with what the pastor said. (Well, they didn’t bring up the sex toys and weed farms, although Stacey Abrams is an erotic fiction author, so we can fill in the blanks there anyway.) Watch: This is a refrain we’re hearing again and again from Kamala’s defenders. They are lashing out at black men, and only black men, for failing to support Kamala Harris. They’re not going after Hispanics, or even white guys. This is maybe the first time in the history of the modern Democrat Party that they’re leaving all of those other demographic groups alone, so that they can harangue black men. It’s hard to imagine a more counterproductive strategy, with under two weeks until the election. Let’s just assume that everything they’re saying is true, and that there’s an unusually large number of black men out there who are skeptical of electing a female president, solely on the basis of the fact that she’s a woman. The way to convince those people that a woman can lead this country isn’t to badger them. It’s not to nag them. That’s what you’d do if you wanted to reinforce every stereotype and negative perception in their minds. What you should do, if you really think there’s a critical mass of black men who are hesitant to vote for a woman, is to actually respond to their concerns. Explain to them why Kamala Harris is deserving of their respect, even though it’s true that various authoritarians and foreign adversaries probably won’t treat her with any kind of respect. Explain all the ways that Kamala Harris has demonstrated leadership and projected toughness, so that these voters can rest assured that they’re leaving the country in capable hands. None of Kamala’s surrogates can do that because they know that Kamala Harris isn’t capable of projecting toughness. She’s not capable of projecting a coherent thought, other than the idea that she grew up in a “middle-class family” and worked in a McDonald’s somewhere, even though there’s no record of either of those things occurring. So we’re left with this. Here’s just one more example. This is Jenn Psaki, the former Biden spokeswoman: If you do what none of these surrogates want to do, which is actually talk to black people, you’ll find that they happen to have the same concerns that other demographic groups have. They’re worried that Kamala Harris is unqualified. And they think she’d be bad for the economy. Here are just a couple of examples. The first is a clip from a voter in Pennsylvania. The second is a focus group conducted by the Daily Mail. The third is a group interview conducted by Anton Daniels. Watch: The second is a focus group conducted by the Daily Mail. The third is a group interview conducted by Anton Daniels. Watch: Imagine that. All of these black voters share some very fundamental concerns that millions of other people have, for good reasons. All of these concerns reflect very real problems with Kamala Harris. This is why Democrats probably shouldn’t have installed her in a coup. This is one of the benefits of actually holding a primary. Nowhere in any of these clips do these voters say that they hate women, or that they don’t think a woman is capable of being president. They obviously aren’t faking their answers, either. These are clearly their actual beliefs. This is why black voters, and in particular black men, aren’t supporting Kamala Harris to the extent they supported other Democrats. You can draw your own conclusions about why the Kamala Harris campaign is so irate about this. Maybe they’re realizing that the late-night vote counts from majority-black counties in eastern Pennsylvania aren’t going to swing their way this time around. (Or if they do swing their way, it’ll look even more suspicious). Maybe that’s why they’re so upset about what black voters are doing, as opposed to other demographic groups. Or maybe Democrats have so little respect for black people that they take their vote as a given, every single election cycle, regardless of the candidate they put forward. Maybe it’s all of the above. Regardless of what exactly is going on here, the Kamala Harris campaign is making its desperation as transparent as possible. This is their closing argument of the 2024 election: Vote for Kamala Harris or you hate women. This is like a parody of how to finish a campaign when you’re trying to elect the first woman president. And the reason the Kamala Harris campaign is losing its mind is that, contrary to all of their expectations, voters can see right through it.

Since 2020, every candidate the Democratic Party has nominated for president since 2000 has actively backed restrictions on free speech online, according to a new analysis from the Media Research Center shared with The Daily Wire. “Since the 2020 election cycle, no less than seven of the most recent 10 presidential nominees have called for censorship and/or government regulation of political speech,” MRC researcher Luis Cornelio found wrote in his analysis. MRC Free Speech For America analyzed the comments and positions of every presidential candidate since 2000. The group found that every Democrat — and just one Republican — who ran for office in that time frame has backed some kind of restriction on speech since 2020, whether banning “misinformation” or pushing for the government to crack down on free expression. That includes former President Barack Obama, President Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the last of whom has advocated censorship for years. Harris has pushed for social media companies to remove posts from former President Donald Trump and demanded more government oversight and regulation for social media companies. “They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation, and that has to stop,” Harris told CNN in 2019. The report found that former President Donald Trump had taken steps to promote free speech, citing his efforts in 2020 to define Section 230 — a provision that largely gives tech companies immunity for what third parties allow on their platforms — in a way that protected the First Amendment. Mitt Romney, who ran for president in 2012, is the only Republican the MRC found to have “voiced support for censorship and against the American principles of free speech online.” The Biden-Harris administration used several federal agencies to censor speech related to the COVID-19 vaccine, MRC previously documented. This came as Biden claimed that Facebook was “killing people” by allowing posts critical of the COVID vaccine. “They’re killing people — I mean they’re really, look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated,” Biden said on July 16, 2021. “And they’re killing people.” Hillary Clinton, who has long blamed her 2016 loss to Trump on so-called Russian disinformation, has proposed arresting Americans for spreading “propaganda.” “I think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda, and whether they should be civilly or even in some cases, criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence,” Clinton said on MSNBC last month. Earlier this month, Clinton urged for social media companies to “moderate” posts, saying on CNN that if “they don’t moderate and monitor content, we lose total control.” “We should be, in my view, appealing something called Section 230, which gave platforms on the internet immunity because they were thought to be pass-throughs that they shouldn’t be judged for the content that is posted—but we now know that was an overly simple view,” she said. Obama said back on April 21, 2022 that protecting “democracy” meant more government regulations for online speech. “Each of us, whether we work at a tech company or consume social media, whether we are a parent, a legislator, an advertiser on one of these platforms, now’s the time to pick a side,” Obama said at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center. “We have a choice right now. Do we allow our democracy to wither or do we make it better?” Last month, John Kerry, who lost the White House to George W. Bush in 2004, asserted that the First Amendment was a major impediment to fighting alleged online misinformation. “But look, if people only go to one source, and the source they go to is sick, and, you know, has an agenda, and they’re putting out disinformation, our First Amendment stands as a major block to be able to just, you know, hammer it out of existence,” he said during a World Economic Forum meeting. Vice President Al Gore, who has made a fortune pushing fear about climate change, compared social media algorithms to AR-15 rifles in December 2023 and called for them to be banned if they lead people in a certain direction. “If you have social media that is dominated by algorithms that pull people down these rabbit holes that are a bit like pitcher plants, these algorithms, they are the digital equivalent of AR-15s,” Gore said. “They ought to be banned, they really ought to be banned. It’s an abuse of the public forum.” Romney, the only Republican on the list, was included because of comments he made during a congressional hearing in July 2023 where he seemed to endorse federal government employees pressuring tech companies to restrict certain posts. “Employees of the federal government have First Amendment rights, too,” Romney said. “Censorship is when the government shuts something off. This is arguing to try to convince somebody else to shut it off and that’s the right people have whether they’re in government or outside of government.” Already have an account?

Top conservative voices slammed Vice President Kamala Harris for saying she would not allow religious exemptions for abortions as president in a Tuesday interview. Harris’ comments came in an interview with NBC News’ Hallie Jackson, who asked Harris: “What concessions would be on the table? Religious exemptions, for example? Is that something you would consider?” “I don’t think we should be making concessions when we are talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body,” a frowning Harris responded.

Is that not an option for you?” “I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals,” Harris responded. Her campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Harris’ comment quickly drew outrage from religious liberty advocates, who argued that Harris was expressing support for unconstitutionally forcing medical professionals to violate their religious beliefs by performing abortions of unborn babies. “So she’s not only pro-abortion, she is anti-religious freedom,” tweeted Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed. “Duly noted.” CatholicVote, a national organization promoting Catholic policies, said in a statement Tuesday night that Harris was admitting “she would deny religious exemptions for abortions — forcing Christians to kill unborn children and seemingly doubling down on weaponizing the government to jail pro-lifers who pray outside abortion facilities.” “Why would any Christian vote for her?” CatholicVote asked. SBA Pro-Life America accused Harris of promising to “federally steamroll Americans into taking part in abortions against their will.” Under such an administration, the pro-life group said, doctors would be forced to perform abortions and taxpayers must pay for them — “for any reason, in all 50 states, no exceptions.” .@KamalaHarris promises ‘freedom’ but then pledges to federally steamroll Americans into taking part in abortions against their will.

Harris was asked the question by Hallie Jackson in an NBC News interview that aired Tuesday night. “Do you believe that transgender Americans should have access to gender-affirming care in this country?” Jackson asked. “I think we should follow the law,” Harris responded. “I mean, I think you’re probably pointing to the fact that Donald Trump’s campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars…” Jackson responded: “They’re trying to define you on this, I’m asking you to define yourself, though, just broadly speaking, what is your value?

The Los Angeles Times, which is California’s largest newspaper, reportedly will not make an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race — a blow to Vice President Kamala Harris as the outlet has backed a Democrat in every White House race since 2008. Sources told Semafor that executive editor Terry Tang informed editorial board staff earlier this month the Los Angeles Times would not pick a favorite presidential candidate. The report noted the decision came from Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a wealthy biotech entrepreneur who bought the newspaper in 2018. A Los Angeles Times spokesperson did not deny the report, saying, “We do not comment on internal discussions or decisions about editorials or endorsements.” The news comes exactly two weeks before Election Day in which Harris is facing former President Donald Trump in the White House race. Although national polls on average show Harris with a slight edge, betting markets and polls indicate Trump is gaining momentum and leading in key battleground states. Harris has received support from the Los Angeles Times in prior contests, including her 2010 and 2014 runs for California attorney general and her 2016 U.S. Senate campaign. The newspaper also endorsed Harris as the running mate to now-President Joe Biden in their successful 2020 campaign against Trump. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 During primary season, Biden locked in the Democratic Party’s 2024 nomination with the support of more than 14 million primary voters. However, Biden dropped out amid pressure from allies following a shaky debate performance in late June, and Harris took his place atop the ticket. A couple of labor unions that endorsed Biden for president in 2020 refused to do the same for Harris this year, instead opting not to back any candidate. One of them, the Teamsters, chose to sit out this year’s contest even though internal polling data found Trump got more support from its members than Harris. Social media was abuzz with reactions after the report on Tuesday stating the Los Angeles Times would not be making an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race. “This is actually kind of surprising,” filmmaker and activist Robby Starbuck said on X. “I don’t think newspaper endorsements matter anymore from major papers (local papers still matter) but LATimes is one of the furthest left papers in the country yet they’re not going to endorse Kamala.

On March 26, Sinwar and Hamas rejected Israel’s offer to pause its counteroffensive in Gaza for six weeks and release approximately 700 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of 40 Israeli hostages. According to the Wall Street Journal, Sinwar argued to Hamas officials that the terror group had the upper hand in negotiations, partly due to increasing U.S. pressure to alleviate suffering in Gaza. It was part of his argument for holding the line in hostage negotiations, even as Israeli forces wiped out terrorists. Where was this pressure coming from in the United States? In the days leading up to Hamas’ rejection of a ceasefire deal, Vice President Kamala Harris ramped up her criticism of the Israeli government, taking an even firmer stance than President Joe Biden, who was caught on a hot mic that month saying he told the Israeli Prime Minister they would have a “come to Jesus meeting.” On March 3, Harris harshly criticized Israel in a Selma, Alabama speech, where she demanded an “immediate ceasefire,” calling the images from Gaza “devastating.” She claimed Palestinians were shot when approaching trucks carrying humanitarian aid. The IDF stated that Palestinians were killed or injured when stampeding each other. In the speech, Harris accused Israel of imposing unnecessary restrictions on humanitarian aid and called for a ceasefire without tying the release of more than a hundred Israeli hostages as a precondition. Members of the National Security Council reportedly toned down parts of the original speech draft which was harsher on Israel, NBC News reported. That same day, Harris took to X to reiterate her call for a ceasefire, calling the situation in Gaza “devastating” and saying “our common humanity compels us to act.” The post made no mention of the hostages. A day later, Harris met with Israeli politician and Netanyahu rival Benny Gantz, then a member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet, who traveled to Washington in defiance of the prime minister. On March 9, Harris alluded to her frustration with the Israeli government, stating that it was important to not “conflate the Israeli government with the Israeli people,” in an interview on CBS. She added that the United States will stand for the security of Israel but will “do what we have done behind closed doors and in public around forcing a better path forward in terms of what’s happening currently in Gaza.” On March 24, Harris said she did not rule out “consequences” for Israel if it launched a ground invasion into Rafah to fight Hamas, calling any such offensive a “huge mistake.” “We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake,” Harris said in an interview on ABC News. “I have studied the maps. There’s nowhere for those folks to go.” When asked about consequences if Israel invaded, Harris said her administration has “been very clear in terms of our perspective on whether or not that should happen” adding that she was “ruling out nothing.” Israel did subsequently invade Rafah, finding six hostages murdered shortly before the IDF discovered them, with a bunker that had Sinwar’s DNA close by, reported the Times of Israel. Sinwar was killed in Rafah on October 16. To make matters worse, on March 25, the United States abstained from a vote in the UN Security Council vote that demanded a ceasefire during Ramadan, without condemning Hamas or linking the release of hostages as a precondition to the ceasefire. This vote marked a departure from previous U.S. vetoes of similar resolutions and led to Israeli Netanyahu’s office canceling a high-level delegation’s planned visit to the United States. Harris’ stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff was meanwhile fundraising for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) during March, which has its U.S. funding suspended over its ties to terror groups in Gaza. Nine UNRWA employees were found to have possible involvement in Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel that included kidnappings, rape, and massacres. Already have an account?

Vice President Kamala Harris‘ campaign team is scrambling to navigate around possible cracks in the so-called “blue wall” — an effort that is only complicated further by the fact that only two weeks remain until Election Day. NBC News Senior National Political Reporter Natasha Korecki published a report on the topic early Tuesday morning, and she shared a few of the key takeaways in a post on X. “NEW: Harris campaign is privately flagging potential cracks in the Blue Wall,” she posted, adding a list of key points. “Discussions of an anomaly w/Blue Wall and not all states falling in the same direction.

"15","https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamala-harris-unserious-campaign","Kamala Harris’ Unserious Campaign","Her campaign has to stage-manage her the way they were stage-managing Joe Biden. In order to win the election, Kamala Harris has suggested Donald Trump is unserious. She stated on Monday that Donald Trump is fundamentally an unserious candidate, but the consequences of his presidency will be so serious. “In many, many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man, but the consequences of him being president of the United States are brutally serious,” she whined. “There are things that he says that will be the subject of skits and laughter and jokes, but words have meaning coming from someone who aspires to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States.” Harris and Trump are virtually polar opposites. Trump says a lot of stuff. He makes jokes about Arnold Palmer’s business and he says funny things about McDonald’s and he makes jokes all the time. He says things that are really out of the box and it’s hard to take them fully seriously because he’s not fully serious when he says them. And even when he is fully serious, does he really mean them 100%? Half the time, no. But — his actual policy is quite serious. That has always been the gap for Donald Trump: his image is sort of buffoonish and goofballish, but his actual policy is hard-nosed. His actual policy accomplishments are quite real, namely: a functional economy, growing innovation, low inflation, a foreign policy record that is second to none in the annals of American history. No major foreign wars, new peace deals in the Middle East, intimidation of our enemies, strengthening our alliances, particularly in the Middle East. And despite all the talk about how he weakened our alliances with NATO, that’s actually not true. He simply requested and succeeded in getting those countries to pay a larger share of their own GDP toward national defense. So Donald Trump has a patina of unseriousness, and underneath he’s a very serious policy candidate. That is why he is running the way he’s running in this election. Kamala Harris is precisely the opposite. She tries to pose as serious, but underneath it is a deep unseriousness. Beneath that façade is total emptiness. She’s a shell of a politician, and below it is just a vacuum. Every day she betrays the fact that there ain’t nothing there. There’s just nothing there. Yesterday, for example, she was doing a presser. She couldn’t even call on the reporters herself. Her campaign has to stage-manage her the way they were stage-managing Joe Biden. You could actually hear one of her campaign aides calling out the reporters because she can’t do it herself. Why are her aides hauling out their reporters? Why isn’t she doing it? Because she’s not capable. In fact, we are now learning that she has reduced her time on the campaign trail. According to Breitbart, “Kamala Harris’s campaign reduced her time on the campaign trail this week, opting to prepare for an interview with NBC and a CNN town hall.” These are not things you have to take time off from the campaign trail to do. They’re not. These are not things that require extra time off. It’s one thing to say I’m taking two days off to prepare for a debate, so I have to study my opponent’s moves. I need to do a sort of lightning round with somebody playing Donald Trump. That would be understandable. But an interview with NBC means you have to take time off the campaign trail? She has to take two days off the campaign trail, two weeks before the election, to prepare for an interview with NBC News, which has been overwhelmingly favorable to her, because she blew it with Bret Baier on Fox News? A CNN town hall. How do you prepare for that? What does that preparation look like? But here’s the thing about Kamala Harris: She has to prepare for everything. The reason that the Left is so worked up about Donald Trump going to McDonald’s is because when Donald Trump went to McDonald’s, he was very comfortable in his own skin. By masquerading as a worker at McDonald’s, Trump was showing respect to people who work at McDonald’s and people who eat at McDonald’s, and he likes those people. Kamala Harris is the kind of person who literally has to be prepared by her staff to do a small donor dinner. They’d put a fake dinner together so she could learn to speak with humans without downing an entire bottle of rosé. Underneath the façade of a serious politician, there is nothing serious there.

A recent report from Christopher Rufo detailed the parts of Vice President Kamala Harris‘ 2009 book that appear to have been plagiarized — but according to a new report from The Washington Free Beacon, the story doesn’t end there. A new report from the Free Beacon’s Aaron Sibarium showed that in 2007 — while she was the San Francisco District Attorney — Harris lifted text from a Republican state attorney and then presented it as her own when testifying before Congress on a loan repayment program for prosecutors. From The Free Beacon: Virtually her entire testimony about the bill was taken from that of another district attorney, Paul Logli of Winnebago County, Illinois, who had testified in support of the legislation two months earlier before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Both statements cite the same surveys, use the same language, and make the same points in the same order, with a paragraph added here or there. They even contain the same typos, such as missing punctuation or mistaken plurals. One error—a “who” that should have been a “whom”—was corrected in Harris’s transposition. Sibarium posted a lengthy thread to X along with screenshots of Logli’s testimony — from several months earlier — alongside Harris’ testimony, which was submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee in April. “In 2007, Kamala Harris plagiarized pages of Congressional testimony from a Republican colleague. And in 2012, she plagiarized a fictionalized story about sex trafficking—but presented it as a real case. It’s not just one book; it’s a career-long pattern,” he began the thread.

Kennedy, responding to an audience member who asked whether anyone present would be allowed to ask a question of the Democratic presidential nominee — which traditionally is the point of the town hall format in the first place — and she told them that they would just have to rely on her to ask the questions that they would most want to have answered. “You’re not, unfortunately, we have some pre-determined questions and I hopefully will be able to ask some of the questions that might be in your head, I hope so,” Shriver said. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 “And this woman — Maria Shriver, no less — cosplays as a journalist at NBC News!” Curtis Houck, managing editor of NewsBusters, responded. “Nothing says ‘town hall’ like predetermined questions,” another social media user said. “Sooo…it was not actually a ‘town hall’ in other words,” RedState’s Brad Slager posted.

With the questions given in advance, her team prepares answers that she simply parrots. There is no opportunity to learn who Harris really is and what she truly believes. (2) The president typically doesn’t receive the hard questions in advance and must be ready to respond at a moment’s notice to new situations that could determine the fate of the country. The script for reality is not given in advance and America needs a leader that knows what to do as reality unfolds rather than one who requires a teleprompter to govern.” There are two principal reasons why voters object to scripted @KamalaHarris: (1) They want to know what she really thinks.

Still more noted that, after nearly 48 hours of Democrats and media complaining about how “scripted” former President Donald Trump’s visit to McDonald’s had been, it seemed a little on the nose for Harris to do a “town hall” without a single surprise question.

Her Admin Gave $1 Million To Group That Wants To End Them.","The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights wants to 'dismantle the U.S. immigration enforcement system' that funds it. A far-left illegal immigrant advocacy organization has raked in over a million dollars from the Biden-Harris Department of Homeland Security while attempting to halt the deportation of illegal aliens and trying to “dismantle the U.S. immigration enforcement system.” The Los Angeles-based Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) advocates for illegal immigration, supports mass amnesty proposals, provides legal assistance to prevent deportations, and uses illegal immigrants in voter mobilization and turnout operations, all while raking in federal grants from the very same agency tasked with maintaining border security. “CHIRLA works to dismantle the U.S. immigration enforcement system that profits from tearing apart immigrant families,” the organization explains, specifically naming DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as its targets. But while the far-left organization has maligned DHS and its immigration enforcement mechanisms as an instrument of oppression, CHIRLA is set to receive $1.2 million in taxpayer funded grants from the federal law enforcement agency. CHIRLA’s federal grants could frustrate Vice President Kamala Harris’s efforts to rebrand herself as a “border state prosecutor” ahead of the presidential election. Over 10 million people have crossed the border under the Biden-Harris administration, with an estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrant gotaways recorded since the pair took office. In the final days of the race, the Harris campaign has even run an advertisement that claims Democrats are the party of border security, featuring an image of former president Donald Trump’s border wall Todd Bensman, a Senior National Security Fellow with the Center for Immigration Studies, told The Daily Wire that CHIRLA could easily find common cause with the Biden-Harris administration, which is staffed with radical ideologues who likely agree with the group’s far-left positions. “It’s perfectly in line with what they’ve been doing for three and a half years,” Bensman said of the funding, adding that the administration is “peopled with appointees who all share those ideologies, the same ideology, which is that border enforcement and immigration laws are immoral.” According to its IRS 990 form, CHIRLA teaches illegal immigrants “how to protect themselves against Immigration Customs Enforcement,” which deports criminal illegal aliens, including those who’ve been charged with violent crimes. A 2023 grant from the DHS U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the amount of $450,000 went to the group for “citizenship instruction and naturalization services.” CHIRLA explains that it focuses on both naturalization and Deferred Action Childhood Arrival applications, the latter of which allows illegal immigrants to avoid deportations. Another grant, this one for $250,000 and awarded in 2022, went to further “innovations in citizenship education.” A 2021 grant of $250,000 to CHIRLA from DHS went towards instruction and naturalization for non-citizens. The DHS grants date back to 2014, when CHIRLA first received $250,000 as it worked to naturalize non-citizens. CHIRLA told The Daily Wire that the funds come “from the USCIS side of DHS, not the enforcement side,” referencing the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Even CHIRLA’s naturalization efforts appear to be ideologically motivated, however. The organization is part of a coalition of nonprofits, previously uncovered by The Daily Wire, that works to naturalize citizens and mobilize them as voters to “sway the outcome of national, state, and local elections” while maintaining demographic reports on key swing states. CHIRLA Executive Director Angelica Salas, who first came to the United States illegally and was deported before being allowed to return as a legal citizen, was previously a board member of the National Partnership for New Americans, a George Soros-funded organization that attempts to mobilize new citizens as voters. The organization is open about its radical stances on immigration, boasting that it uses illegal immigrants to attempt to mobilize voters for leftwing causes. One of CHIRLA’s projects “targets new citizens, Latinos, and English learners to build a voter base from scratch, with enough power to sway state politics.” “Teams of paid/volunteer canvassers/phone bankers, ranging in status from undocumented to legal permanent residents, work to build a constant culture of voting among these voters,” CHIRLA explains. The radical organization advocates for amnesty for all illegal immigrants present in the United States and has called for “immediate immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented people.” CHIRLA also raises money to give scholarships to immigrant students, specifically saying they seek out those who are in the country illegally. There’s also the CHIRLA Action Fund, an associated organization that is allowed to support political candidates for office and favors Democrats. Salas also serves as the board president for the CHIRLA Action Fund. The CHIRLA Action Fund endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) for Senate, as well as the Soros-backed Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon. Already have an account? Your information could be the missing piece to an important story.

"19","https://www.dailywire.com/news/liberals-are-exploiting-this-loophole-to-flood-swing-states-with-dark-money","Liberals Are Exploiting This Loophole To Flood Swing States With Dark Money","A leftist dark money group is pouring foreign money into state ballot campaigns. A leftist dark money group appears to have identified a loophole that allows it to funnel cash from foreign billionaires into U.S. elections, spending tens of millions of dollars to drive turnout in key states. The Sixteen Thirty Fund, a nonprofit that has funneled more than $1 billion dollars in dark money to liberal causes, has spent nearly $23 million this election cycle on state ballot initiatives covering everything from abortion to election reform, according to a report from Americans for Public Trust provided exclusively to The Daily Wire. Because the ballot initiatives tend to be on liberal issues, the voters they draw to the polls are also likely to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris while they’re at it. Some of the donors to the dark money group include Democrat megadonor George Soros, eBay founder and billionaire Pierre Omidyar, and Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, who said he has “never felt the need to become an American” but wants to “(re)interpret the American Constitution in the light of progressive politics,” according to a biography written by his sister. Wyss has given $243 million to Sixteen Thirty Fund. As a foreign national, Wyss is prohibited from donating to American political candidates or influencing the country’s elections, but he is not prohibited from funding state ballot initiative campaigns. This election cycle, the Sixteen Thirty Fund is funding ballot initiatives in several swing states or states with a close Senate election, Americans for Public Trust found. In Arizona, the group gave $1.25 million to support a ballot initiative that will enshrine a right to abortion in the state constitution if it passes. Nevada has a similar abortion initiative on the ballot this November, and the Sixteen Thirty Fund has given $500,000 to that effort. Democrats hope that putting abortion on the ballot will boost Democratic voter turnout in these states. The Sixteen Thirty Fund is also funding ballot initiatives in Ohio, Florida, Nebraska, Montana, Missouri, and Alaska. Since 2014, the Sixteen Thirty Fund has spent more than $115 million on ballot initiatives in 25 states — including $34 million in Michigan, $21 million in Ohio, $11 million in Colorado, $10 million in Missouri, $7 million in Nevada, about $3.5 million each in Florida and North Carolina, and $1 million in Arizona. Americans for Public Trust called on Congress and state legislatures to close this “foreign influence loophole.” “It’s unconscionable that foreign money is currently influencing our politics through a loophole most mainstream media and politicians are either ignoring or don’t know about,” Americans for Public Trust Executive Director Caitlin Sutherland told The Daily Wire. “Activists like the ones running Sixteen Thirty Fund are targeting competitive states — not just to usher in left-wing legislative changes via these ballot measures, but also to give a boost to the liberals at the top of the ticket, which folks have openly admitted that’s their goal,” Sutherland said. Sutherland pointed out that in Montana, Democrat Senator Jon Tester’s campaign is struggling, and Montana “not so coincidentally” has an abortion initiative on the ballot. “I can’t imagine Montanans would be okay knowing foreign dark money is targeting their state to give a boost to the Left’s preferred candidate,” she said. Missouri was the “top target” for the Sixteen Thirty Fund this cycle, Sutherland said. “At least $8 million came into their state from this foreign-backed group to fund two ballot issue campaigns — one on abortion and one on minimum wage/paid sick leave. I don’t think the people of Missouri would be thrilled to know a foreign billionaire is helping push policy that would never pass in a million years if they weren’t sidestepping the legislature,” she said. She suggested looking to Ohio, which earlier this year became the first state to ban both direct and indirect foreign funding of state ballot issues — although not before the Sixteen Thirty Fund pumped millions of dollars into a ballot initiative there.

"20","https://www.dailywire.com/news/trumps-cruising-kamalas-crashing","Trump’s Cruising, Kamala’s Crashing","It appears that Donald Trump has regained momentum not only in the swing states, but also in the battleground states. We are two weeks out from the election and Donald Trump currently has all the momentum. Not some of the momentum— all the momentum. This has been a wild race because the momentum shifts have been insane. When Joe Biden was in the race, Trump had all the momentum. Then Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris was put into the middle of the race and suddenly there was “joy” and “wonder” and all the momentum shifted over to the Democrats. And then the air slowly came out of the balloon. It appears that Donald Trump has regained momentum not only in the swing states, but also in the battleground states. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Trump leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia. All he needs to do to win the election is win Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia and either Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, and he is leading in the last three, according to Real Clear Politics. He also happens to be leading in Nevada. So if the election were held today — no tossups — he could win 312 electoral votes. Trump is going to win the election. In order for Kamala Harris to win this election, she probably needs to be up at least two and a half to three points in the popular vote. She does not appear to have those numbers behind her right now, unless the polls are very, very wrong. What’s more, her campaign is flagging. She’s totally disconnected from the American people. In fact, she is attempting to reach out to the Liz Cheney voter. There aren’t that many of those folks, the disaffected Republicans who love Liz Cheney and now are going to move on over from Donald Trump to Kamala Harris. Those people are incredibly rare. That number is vanishingly small. But according to The Wall Street Journal: Harris is expected to hold events on Monday with Cheney in suburbs in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. She’s also hosting separate get-out-the-vote rallies later in the week with former President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama in Georgia and Michigan, swing states where Harris needs to run up large margins in the urban centers and suburbs. So she’s now relying on a halo effect from the Obamas to bring out the black vote in Georgia and Michigan. How much is she flailing? She’s flailing so much that the Washington Post editorial board put out a piece saying that she should commit to having a big 250th birthday celebration for the country in 2026, to recapture the feeling of patriotism by pledging that in July of 2026, she would throw a giant party for the American semiquincentennial. If this is what’s left in her bag, she’s got nothing. Over the weekend, it was Kamala Harris’s birthday. Kamala Harris decided she was going to celebrate it with Stevie Wonder. She went to a historically black church and she did some sort of birthday routine with Stevie Wonder. Meanwhile, Trump was at the Steelers-Jets game, getting standing ovations and having people run around the field with pro-Trump signs. And that wasn’t the best thing that Trump did all weekend. The Left lost their mind because Donald Trump did something unthinkable. He went to a McDonald’s and worked the fry station and the drive-thru window. That was old school politicking in the United States. It was charming. It was funny. It is meant to highlight the disconnect between what Kamala Harris says she is and what she is. You’ll recall that she has now claimed multiple times that she worked at McDonald’s while she was a college student. And there are some fairly serious questions about whether that’s true or not. She has yet to name which McDonald’s she actually worked at. There are no records of her having worked at McDonald’s so far as anyone is aware. It’s not really a big deal, except that it undermines any claim of authenticity that she has, because she is completely ersatz. She is the vinyl of actual human beings. She is not made of anything organic as a candidate. So Trump went to a McDonald’s, worked the drive-thru window, and looked perfectly authentic there. I don’t care whether you like Donald Trump or you hate Donald Trump. He is excellent at this. It’s a special quality that some politicians have; he is amazingly good one-on-one with people. Trump speaks to people as though they are family. Donald Trump enjoys other human beings. Kamala Harris doesn’t look like she’s ever met a human. I’m not sure a lot of other politicians would be able to get away with what Trump did, except that he eats McDonald’s all the time. When he was president of the United States, he had a giant meal sponsored at the White House in the giant reception room that was filled with fast food from places like McDonald’s. And at McDonald’s, he looked like he was having a good time, which is a good indication that he is winning, because you can often tell a winning campaign from a losing campaign by who’s having a better time on the campaign trail. Losing campaigns are relentless and grueling and annoying, and the candidate seems weathered and doesn’t want to be there. And that’s how it feels with Kamala Harris. Trump is in a very good mood. He’s definitely enjoying this campaign. Kamala Harris is definitely not enjoying this campaign. And that should tell you something.

Is it overblown?” “Absolutely it’s overblown, and I find it quite offensive to be honest with you, Victor, because the people who are going to impact this election the most when it comes to Donald Trump are conservative white voters,” Cross declared. “I think that narrative is attempting to lay the failure of this democracy at the feet of black men.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Blackwell noted that former President Barack Obama was on the campaign trail and had told black men not to eschew voting for Harris because she’s a woman. “Was it a mistake for the former president to say what he did or to say it publicly? What was your assessment of what we heard from former President Obama?” he asked. “You know, I think that it’s wonderful that President Obama is out hitting the trail for democracy, frankly,” Rye replied. “And what I think is a mistake is to let white folks escape the accountability that they must face for not showing up to save democracy themselves. Like they want to get mad at presidential candidates right when they don’t wear a flag lapel pin or they don’t see you pledging allegiance to the flag, that’s what they want to get upset about. Now, the face of patriotism to them looks like trying to tear down the capitol in a terrorist attack on January 6, 2021. So the responsibility of saving democracy should be on the largest demographic in this country, that is white men and white women.” .@angela_rye: “What I think is a mistake is to let white folks escape the accountability that they must face for not showing up to save democracy … The responsibility of saving democracy should be on the largest demographic in this country, that is white men & white women. pic.twitter.com/AjdbPYRGI0 — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) October 19, 2024 “Harris’s support among Black voters in Georgia trails the levels that Joe Biden secured in his narrow, 11,779-vote victory in 2020,” Financial Times noted. “According to polling data released this week from Insider Advantage, Trump’s share of the Black vote in Georgia has reached 14 per cent, compared with 11 per cent in 2020.

"22","https://www.dailywire.com/news/why-kamala-harris-is-a-perfect-poster-child-for-whats-wrong-with-dei","Why Kamala Harris Is A Perfect Poster Child For What’s Wrong With DEI","If Kamala Harris in all her incompetent radicalism were to gain authority over an already out-of-control bureaucracy, we would be in greater danger. In a few short weeks, Americans will not only be given a historic “opportunity” to vote for a nominee who famously never won a presidential primary, they may propel in power the epitome of DEI to lead the free world. It’s for those reasons that Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, has replaced former Harvard University President Claudine Gay as my poster child for the “adversity of diversity.” Let me elaborate. Last year I wrote “The Adversity of Diversity,” where I argued against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. My book also scrutinized how DEI selection criteria invariably violate our civil rights laws and constitutional protections against discrimination. It was DEI that ensured the rise of the now-disgraced former Harvard president, Claudine Gay. It was also DEI that stayed the university’s hand from completely ousting Gay, though her academic clout came about from her rampant plagiarism of several scholars, including myself. Although Gay no longer holds the lofty title of “president,” she has retained a comfortable teaching position where she is reportedly instructing students on “Reading and Research.” Fast forward to this year. Who would have imagined that the presidency of the United States would be on the DEI line? The selection-sans-election of Kamala Harris makes it clear that, as always, all qualifications and standards go out the window when DEI enters the picture. DEI is white racism in disguise. White racism is an arrogance that manifests itself in the belief that holding racial and ethnic minorities to the same standards as white people means that you will have lily-white institutions and corridors of power, because no minority could possibly meet meritorious standards. To prove their point, adherents of the belief ignore black talent while seeking out mediocre blacks of high pedigree. The Claudine Gays, Ibram X Kendis, and the Kamala Harrises of the world are elevated and lauded. White racism rejects integration, equal opportunity, and fair play. Instead, it insists on group inclusion rather than individual merit. Outcomes are fixed if you have the approval of the “right” white elites. For Harris, the die was cast when presidential candidate Joe Biden announced that his vice president would be a woman. This automatically restricted the pool of qualified candidates. It didn’t take long before thousands of influential black women organized a pressure campaign for the nominee to be a black woman. White women dutifully stepped back. Eventually, the top contenders were whittled down to former Georgia state representative Stacy Abrams and former U.S. California Senator Kamala Harris. It was a beauty contest between Titans that Harris won. Clearly, her credentials and connections outshone and overshadowed Abrams. The “adversity of diversity” occurs when unqualified individuals are placed into the pinnacles of power where white progressives control and protect them. Their lack of experience and disdain for American values can wreak havoc on the institutions they are tapped to lead. When we look at the life accomplishments of Kamala Harris, there is nothing that jumps out at us that would make a reasonable person see presidential or even vice presidential material. She has no real accomplishments to date. What has Harris done that would make anyone believe she is qualified to become the leader of the free world? Kamala has been given numerous opportunities to demonstrate hidden talents and flashes of brilliance. She has failed every time. Every debate, every unmerited rise to power, every highly-publicized stop along her career path from being Willie Brown’s girlfriend to elective office in California — it all has proven her to be as incompetent as she is radical. If Kamala Harris in all her incompetent radicalism were to gain authority over an already out-of-control bureaucracy, we would be in greater danger. Our nation is on the edge of a free-fall. The last thing we need is an unintellectual coward who lacks the vision necessary to strengthen and restore America at the helm. Her leadership skills are reflected in her history of hemorrhaging staff and the momentous decision to choose former Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, an admitted knucklehead, as her vice-president. Kamala can’t even see the damage she and Joe did over the last four years. A Center Square Poll (July 2024) found that two-thirds of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. And yet, when asked by two different interviewers (Fox News’ Bret Baier and The View’s Sunny Hostin) whether as president she would do anything different, Harris responded to Hostin: “There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of — and I’ve been a part of — of the decisions that have had impact.” This disconnect confuses me. Kamala could be justifying her work based on the many mainstream media polls that claim her and Donald J. Trump are neck-and-neck among voters. While I tend to believe the outcomes of non-mainstream polls like the one conducted by Center Square are more accurate — judging by the sentiments of average Americans reflecting on their ever-rising cost of living — it may be that the mainstream media polls are also accurate. The polls indicating a close race may have captured the psyche of the post-2020 American: so conditioned by the fear of appearing racist or sexist that they set aside their own interests and go along with identity politics to oppose the designated minority. Whatever the reason that polls on the race vary so greatly, the presidency of the United States is too important to be sacrificed to the insatiable appetite of DEI. Our nation is the last best hope for the free world. With DEI at the helm, our freedoms will further erode and inevitably cease to exist. Anyone who truly loves this country could not support a candidate installed without the approval of the American people, let alone one selected based on gender and color. We must demand better and vote accordingly. * * * Dr. Carol M.

Vice President Kamala Harris agreed with a far-left protester late last week who falsely claimed that Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza is a “genocide.” The moment came when Harris was speaking Thursday at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee when a student, identified by the New York Post as being “pro-Hamas,” interrupted her event. When Harris said that she was invested in the students, the heckler fired back: “And in genocide right? Billions of dollars in genocide. Billions of dollars in genocide.” “I’m speaking right now,” Harris responded. “I know what you’re speaking of. I want the ceasefire. I want the war to end. And I respect your right to speak but I am speaking right now.” “But what about the genocide? What about the genocide though?” the protestor, wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh, shouted as security began to escort him from the room. The heckler shouted numbers published by the Gaza Health Ministry, which is controlled by the Hamas terrorist organization. Those figures have been widely disputed. “19,000 children are dead,” the student claimed, “and you won’t call it a genocide.” Even President Joe Biden, who has been critical of Israel’s military operations against Hamas, has acknowledged that Israel’s military operation is not a “genocide.” After the protester was removed from the event, Harris responded: “Listen, what he’s talking about, it’s real. That’s not the subject that I came to discuss today, but it’s real and I respect his voice.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 David Friedman, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, posted on X that Harris’ “validation of this ugly genocide charge is ignorant, malign and thoroughly disqualifying for any public office, let alone the presidency!” “Since Israel became a state, its Palestinian Arab population increased more than ten-fold!” he added. Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren posted X said that the incident set “a very dangerous precedent.” “I was disturbed to view the video in which Vice President Kamala Harris appears to confirm the charge that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza,” he added. “This is the first time that the White House has been linked to a libel which threatens Israel’s legitimacy and security.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign boasted a nearly $222 million haul in September, more than three times the money raised by former President Donald Trump’s campaign last month. FEC filings posted on Sunday night showed Harris’ campaign raising $221.8 million in September to the Trump campaign’s $63 million, The Hill reported. The Harris campaign, combined with the Democratic National Committee and the state parties, raised nearly $360 million in September. The Republican National Committee and other Republican-affiliated groups combined with the Trump campaign raised $160 million over the same period, according to the Associated Press. A large percentage of Harris’ September haul — about $82 million — came from glitzy fundraisers her campaign held with celebrities and politicians in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City. The fundraising numbers for the Harris campaign set a new record for the biggest fundraising quarter, as it received $1 billion in the three-month period that ended on September 30. Some of that money, however, was part of President Joe Biden’s war chest before Harris became the de facto nominee in July and inherited tens of millions of dollars from the Biden campaign. The Harris campaign spent more than it took in last month, pouring $270 million into advertisements on TV, radio, billboards, and the internet, the AP reported. In September, the Trump campaign spent around $53 million on media, according to The New York Times. Harris and the groups supporting her said they entered October with $348 million on hand, while Trump and his supporting groups entered the new month with $283 million.

Musk’s America PAC is offering $47 a day to anyone who refers a registered swing state voter to sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments, and the billionaire announced during a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday that he will give away $1 million “randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election.” Already have an account?

Vice President Kamala Harris was unable to name anything that she would do differently than President Joe Biden when again confronted about the matter this week. Harris made the remarks during a brief interview Friday afternoon with NBC News reporter Peter Alexander on the campaign trail in Grand Rapids, Michigan. “What is one policy that you would have done differently over these last three and a half years than President Biden?” Alexander asked. “I mean, to be very candid with you, even including Mike Pence, vice presidents are not critical of their presidents,” she said. “I think that really actually, in terms of the tradition of it, and also just going forward, it does not make for a productive and important relationship.” WATCH: 🚨🚨🚨 “What is one policy that you would’ve done differently over these last 3.5 years than Pres.

MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 “And I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact,” she noted. When asked about the matter by CBS’ Stephen Colbert, Harris said, “Well, I’m obviously not Joe Biden. So that would be one change in terms of … but also, I think it’s important to say with 28 days to go, I’m not Donald Trump.” Harris was again asked the same question during an interview with Bret Baier this week. “My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency,” she declared. “And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.” Related: Kamala Signals She’s Open To Spending Trillions On Racial Reparations Already have an account?

It turns out that the clip had to be edited to remove a section of the staged phone call where she called herself a “devout public servant” and denounced bureaucracy for getting in the way of federal aid, the New York Post reported. A full 38 seconds were removed from the two-minute call. “I am a devout public servant, but I know how bureaucracy and red tape can get in the way of getting stuff done in a timely manner,” Harris said in the removed section, according to a copy of a more complete recording obtained by the Post. Another revision removed a comment from Harris coaching Welch, a fellow Democrat, on how to stand tall for his constituents. “Your folks are looking in your eyes to make sure and see something in you that lets them know everything’s going to be OK, and sometimes you know everything’s going to be OK, sometimes you don’t,” Harris said in the original version of the conversation. The version posted online only has her saying “sometimes you know everything’s going to be OK, sometimes you don’t.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 There were other minor revisions, according to the Post, including one instance of Harris saying “you know” as a filler phrase. Harris posted the Welch conversation as she was trying to claim Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) refused to take her phone call. Harris had called DeSantis “utterly irresponsible” and “selfish” even though disaster had just struck Florida and the vice president had no role in disaster relief, The Daily Wire reported at the time. Shortly after, Biden’s social media team posted on X to say that the president was working with DeSantis. “Tonight, I spoke with Florida Governor DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Castor for firsthand reports on Hurricane Helene recovery and preparations for Hurricane Milton,” the post said. “My Administration is ready to support both leaders and the people of Florida with any further resources they may need.” DeSantis also pushed back on Harris’ claims about a phone call, saying he had never received calls from her before and she had never been involved in any of his administration’s disaster response efforts previously. He added that she had “no role” in the process and wasn’t even in the chain of command on the issue. The revelation that Harris had to edit her phone conversation with Welch comes as CBS News faces its own editing scandal involving Harris. CBS edited one of Harris’ “60 Minutes” answers, and now U.S. Senators are calling for the network to release the full transcript of Harris’ interview, The Daily Wire reported. CBS initially posted Harris’ response to a question about Israel that did not match the version of her answer that aired on TV. In the original clip posted by CBS, Harris said: “The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.” But the full interview edited out that answer and replaced it with Harris saying something from a completely different question.

There’s nowhere for those folks to go. And we’re looking at about 1.5 million people in Rafah who were there because they were told to go there, most of them.

Within hours of Vice President Kamala Harris‘ appearance on Fox News, it became clear that the legacy media outlets had all received their pre-written talking points and their marching orders. The interview, which was shortened to just over 20 minutes after the vice president arrived late — grew combative at times as Bret Baier pressed the Democratic presidential nominee for real answers. Harris responded to each question — regardless of topic — by filibustering until she found a point from which she could pivot and attack her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump. Democrats and multiple media personalities took to X to do damage control because, as Mark Hemingway noted, “If Kamala had done well, they’d be posting her highlights from the interview, not attacking Baier, who was perfectly professional.” “I figured @BretBaier would be tough.

But we have the receipts.' Daily Wire host Michael Knowles exposes the failures, the fatal disasters, and the just plain “weird” happenings of the Biden-Harris presidency in his damning 10-minute election recap. From the border crisis and botched withdrawal from Afghanistan to spying on Catholics and cross-dressing admin officials stealing women’s luggage, Knowles takes a “trip down memory lane” for any voter still unsure of how to vote this cycle. The Biden-Harris Presidency EXPOSED In 10 Mins pic.twitter.com/kKx8x9MdM7 — The Michael Knowles Show (@MKnowlesShow) November 2, 2024 “Election Day is almost here, and it has been a crazy three and a half years that led us to this point,” Knowles says. “The establishment media have done their best to cover up the many historic failures of the Biden-Harris administration. But we have the receipts.” Here are the eight craziest. 1. The Border Crisis Knowles detailed how Biden and Harris nullified former President Donald Trump’s border policies within hours of being sworn in, and later ended Trump’s vital “Remain in Mexico” policy. “The result has been the worst migration crisis in U.S. history,” Knowles said, noting that the crisis directly led to numerous high-profile crimes, including the murders of Laken Riley, Rachel Morin, and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray. Additionally, about 200,000 Americans have died from fentanyl overdoses. 2. Vaccine Mandates The Biden-Harris administration mandated the COVID vaccine for federal workers and tried to extend the mandate to some private sector companies. The Daily Wire sued over that mandate, and won at the Supreme Court, invalidating the order. 3. The Afghanistan Debacle Seven months into the Biden-Harris presidency, the administration “botched the pullout from Afghanistan, a decision that left 13 U.S. servicemen dead, and surrendered more than $7 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban, which quickly retook control of Afghanistan, squandering two decades of American involvement in the region,” Knowles recalled. Harris has since bragged about being the “last person in the room” with Biden when he made the decision to pull out. 4. Wars And Chaos Everywhere Knowles also explained the moves from the Biden-Harris administration that allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine. “Hundreds of thousands of people killed, and upwards of three-quarters of a million wounded in a war funded by $64.1 billion of U.S. taxpayer money,” he said. Under Biden and Harris, the United States also watched “as China flew a spy balloon over U.S. territory for eight days straight,” Knowles noted. The admin also gave Iran access to $16 billion in previously frozen assets, which Knowles called “a favor Iran repaid a few months later on October 7, when its proxies attacked Israel, murdering 1,139 people, including 46 Americans.” 5. A Bad Economy On the economy, Knowles explained how the ironically-named Inflation Reduction Act actually “exacerbated inflation,” driving it up a total of 20%. He also points out that U.S. debt has increased substantially under Biden and Harris. 6. Creepy Staffers Moving on to the “just plain odd,” Knowles recalled how Sam Brinton, the Biden-Harris “nuclear waste guru” was “arrested for stealing women’s clothing at airports.” Dialing up their commitment to LGBT ideology, the administration also declared Easter Sunday a “Transgender Day of Visibility” in 2024, and mandated schools permit males into female spaces if they identify as transgender. 7. Persecuting Religious Believers Knowles also highlighted the Biden-Harris administration’s “spying” on traditional Catholic parishes, lying about that spying, and targeting concerned parents at school board meetings. 8. Harris Covering Up Biden’s Decline Closing the video, Knowles reminded viewers of Democrats, including Harris, lying about Biden’s obvious mental decline for years — until the president’s debate performance was so bad, the Democrat party machine replaced him with Harris, who did not win a single primary vote.

During an exchange with reporters in Detroit on Sunday, Harris said she had just filled out her mail-in ballot.

A summary posted online says Prop 36 would allow “felony charges for possessing certain drugs and for thefts under $950, if defendant has two prior drug or theft convictions.” Critics have knocked Democrats, including Harris, over Prop 47 while highlighting California’s struggles with retail theft, homelessness, drug use, and violent crime in recent years. However, Semafor reported Harris did not take a stance on Prop 47 a decade ago, noting how there were “some procedural reasons” while she was serving as California’s attorney general. Harris faced blowback on social media due to the VP staying mum on whether she voted for Prop 36.

A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) official is calling out both NBC and Vice President Kamala Harris for her last-minute appearance on Saturday Night Live, saying it was a “clear and blatant” to evade rules designed to stop networks from tilting the political scales ahead of an election. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said the appearance on the network’s flagship sketch comedy show was a “clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule.” Carr made his point in a post on X, noting that the timing and Harris’ appearance — not announced until the day it was happening and took place just three days prior to the November 5 general election — effectively eliminated any possibility for her competitor, former President Donald Trump, to receive the federally-mandated “equal time.” “This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule. The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct — a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election. Unless the broadcaster offered Equal Time to other qualifying campaigns,” Carr pointed out. He went on to note that the issue had arisen in 2016 when Trump appeared on the same show, and that former President Barack Obama’s FCC chair had stated that the “Equal Time” provision would be enforced. “In the 2016 cycle, President Obama’s FCC Chair made clear that the agency would enforce the Equal Time rule when candidate Trump went on SNL. NBC stations publicly filed Equal Opportunity notices to ensure that all other qualifying candidates could obtain Equal Time if they sought it. Stations did the same thing when Clinton appeared on SNL,” he explained. Carr then explained that, with only three days — and zero “SNL” broadcasts remaining — before the election, NBC had “effectively structured” Harris’ appearance to make it impossible for the network to offer Trump anything even remotely comparable. “What comparable time and placement can they offer all other qualifying candidates?” he asked. Just weeks ago, SNL’s Lorne Michaels said that they *would not* be bringing any of the candidates on due to election and equal time laws: “‘You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,’ Michaels said.” pic.twitter.com/xtfnNFXdfr — Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC) November 3, 2024 In fact, just weeks earlier, “SNL” producer Lorne Michaels announced that he had no intention of putting either Harris or Trump on the show — and he cited the FCC’s “equal time” provisions as the reason behind that decision. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions. You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated,” Michaels told The Hollywood Reporter in mid-September.

And they do. “If he wins in November, it will be the birth of the American Nazi party” pic.twitter.com/jpUFfKgUZ3 — Daily Wire (@realDailyWire) November 3, 2024 “I think he wants to basically turn this into a white Christian nation, which it is not,” another attendee said of Trump’s motives, before saying that she isn’t concerned that the heated rhetoric could inspire more violence against the former president. “I think it is a totally reasonable assumption,” she said of claims that Trump is a Nazi. “I mean, Elon Musk is wearing a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat in the Nazi font,” she continued, referring to Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden. “That was definitely the vibe there, it was frightening and disgusting.” “I hope he goes to prison. I think he should go to prison,” she added. “I think he’s a full fascist authoritarian.” One man said that both Trump and his supporters were Nazis. “You committed treason, and we hate your ever f***ing guts,” he said of people who vote for Trump, adding that the Republican presidential contender “wants to destroy all life on earth.” “They don’t get to be the Nazis on our street. They don’t get to turn our police into, you know, they’re Gestapo. F*** them,” the man said. “If they want to bring on the violence, America, we’ll kick their ass.” When asked what his final message would be, he remarked “love wins in the end.” During her speech, Harris called Trump a “petty tyrant” and a “wannabe dictator,” and compared her opponent to King George III. Shortly after Trump narrowly escaped death at the hands of a would-be assassin in Butler, Pennsylvania in July, President Joe Biden urged Americans to “lower the temperature” in politics.

"34","https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamala-set-for-surprise-appearance-on-saturday-night-live","Kamala Set For Surprise Appearance On ‘Saturday Night Live’","The Trump campaign said the move showed Kamala was out of touch with the American people. Vice President Kamala Harris will reportedly make an appearance on Saturday Night Live for the show’s final episode before Election Day. Harris was scheduled to fly to the battleground state of Michigan, but her flight apparently rerouted for New York earlier tonight. Sources told the New York Post that the Secret Service was already on site preparing for Harris’ arrival. “It’s all been hush-hush,” a source told the Post, adding that Harris was expected to appear during the cold open. The show will be hosted by comedian John Mulaney. The move was mocked by the Trump campaign, who accused Harris of being out of touch with the American people. “Kamala Harris has nothing substantive to offer the American people, so that’s why she’s living out her warped fantasy cosplaying with her elitist friends on Saturday Night Leftists as her campaign spirals down the drain into obscurity,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News. “For the last four years, Kamala’s destructive policies have led to untold misery and hurt for all Americans. She broke it, and President Trump will fix it.” Trump advisor Jason Miller also ripped into Harris over the apparent move, asking if Harris did “not know SNL has been crushing her all season?” “First time she’s speaking directly to journalists this entire campaign,” conservative commentator Stephen Miller posted on X. SNL creator Lorne Michaels suggested in an interview earlier this year that neither Trump nor Harris would appear on the show. “You can’t bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,” Michaels said at the time and then clarified: “You can’t have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ SNL roasted Harris running mate and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz last month over his false claim that he was in Hong Kong during China’s Tiananmen Square massacre in the summer of 1989. The appearance on SNL comes after a day full of campaigning from both Trump and Harris.

"35","https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-faithful-should-fear-a-kamala-presidency","The Faithful Should Fear A Kamala Presidency","She has a long rap sheet of being hostile to people of faith, dating back to her time as Attorney General in California. The ballots aren’t even counted, yet no amount of scripture citing or fake accents while playing preacher on the Sunday morning campaign stump can distract from what Kamala Harris has already promised — she’s no friend of the faithful. Quite the contrary. In the final weeks of the campaign she’s reminding us, elect her and she’s coming for your religious liberty. Pastors and people in the pews, consider yourselves warned. At a recent Wisconsin rally, Kamala told two students who shouted “Jesus is Lord” they were at the wrong rally, before having them escorted out. She was so pleased with herself as she cackled at her off-the-cuff remark, painfully ignorant that we live in a country where 68% of people still consider themselves Christian. Nobody laughed but her, and a weekend damage control tour to black churches in Georgia quickly followed. While her campaign has been short on details, in an interview with NBC’s Hallie Jackson she was crystal clear for possibly the first time, warning that she’ll handcuff religious freedom by denying religious exemptions for abortion. Thanks to her clarity we know doctors with deeply held convictions will be forced to perform the procedure even if it violates their faith and conscience. None of this is new information. She has a long rap sheet of being hostile to people of faith and coming for religious freedom, dating back to her time as Attorney General of California. As Senator, she challenged the nomination of Knights of Columbus (KOC) member Brian Buescher to the U.S. District Court for Nebraska because KOC adheres to traditional Catholic teaching. Apparently Catholicism is extreme. She also supported the “Do No Harm Act,” which would have forced medical providers to perform abortions. Have a deeply held religious conviction? Too bad. The Do No Harm Act would have done a lot of harm by also shutting the doors of charities like the “Little Sisters of the Poor” for refusing to violate their Catholic beliefs on issues like sexuality. Imagine telling nuns they can’t be Catholic with a bill that says you can’t discriminate. It doesn’t end there. She pushed the FACE Act as California Attorney General, which would have forced pregnancy centers to make abortion referrals to women. By their very nature most pregnancy centers are faith-based and provide numerous resources and support to both the mom and the baby throughout the pregnancy, as well as afterward. Doesn’t matter. This is from the party that pretends to care about women. As Attorney General she also joined her counterparts to go after Hobby Lobby and other faith-based employers in an attempt to force them to include abortion pills as part of their health benefits. Harris also supported the Equality Act, which would have forced religious institutions to hire people at odds with their beliefs — read “gender ideology.” But, you say, what about that 30-year-old Religious Freedom Restoration Act that keeps government out of the business of Americans’ religious rights — the one even then Sen. Joe Biden supported? Throw it in the trash. This “Equality Act” would have provided zero equality for any faith-based institution. Imagine if she aimed her hostile warrior powers at the out of control crime in our country instead of our constitutionally protected religious freedom. George Barna, director of research at Arizona Christian University’s Cultural Research Center, conducted recent surveys that found 49% of self-described people of faith likely won’t vote in the upcoming election. Interestingly, the study also found that roughly 5 million of the unlikely voters would reverse course if their pastor encouraged them to vote. What? Politicking from the pulpit? Hardly. Nobody is suggesting we turn our altars into campaign rallies. Our secular nation has hijacked Christian values, rebranded them as political and then declared them off limits in our churches, and many pastors have dutifully — and a little too eagerly — complied. Today at the intersection of every major cultural issue driving political narratives lies the Bible, which had the first word on most of these hot button issues dating back more than 2,000 years. If your church doesn’t want to talk about culture and elections because they’re afraid to get political, ask them if they mind getting Biblical. Another Barna study released last year found that out of the 68% of people in this country who identify as Christian, only 6% have a Biblical worldview. That’s a shocking number. How will people in our churches ever understand what the Bible says about our culture unless our pastors tell them. Few pastors get this better than Pastor Gary Hamrick of Cornerstone Chapel, a church of more than six thousand in Leesburg, VA, just west of Washington, DC. He actively takes on cultural issues through a Biblical lens, often hosting those at his church fighting for righteousness in our culture including Riley Gaines, Charlie Kirk and Kirk Cameron. Every four years he preaches an election sermon to encourage his congregation to vote Biblical values. He’s not alone. Answering the question of how our country got to its current state, Pastor Rusty Guenther of First Baptist Church in Blowing Rock, NC, blamed the church’s willingness to accept that politics is off limits. In reality, the Bible has a lot to say about politics. He’s right, it’s the world that’s turned politics into a four letter word within the walls of our churches. Open the Bible and you’ll see it addresses issues like biological sex, border security, the nation of Israel, religious liberty, parental rights, marriage and life. Dr. Erwin W. Lutzer, Pastor Emeritus and former Senior Pastor of The Moody Church in Chicago agrees, saying “…If we’re going to be true to the scriptures, we have to talk about those issues which impinge on politics.” Pastors have a responsibility to arm their congregations with a Biblical worldview on cultural issues. As Pastor Gary Hamrick said, “Good government cannot save us, but bad government can destroy us.” We know that, if elected, Kamala is coming for our religious freedom. She’s done it before and she’s already promising she’ll do it again. * * * Lauren DeBellis Appell, a former lobbyist and communications aide on Capitol Hill, is a writer based in Fairfax, Virginia.

The presidential campaigns of former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris touted bullish takeaways from internal data in the final stretch of the 2024 campaign, but each side appears to be focused on different trends. As public polls signaled a close race on Monday, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt made an appearance on Fox Business and said early voters in swing states are leaning toward the GOP ticket. “Our internal polls have President Trump leading in every key battleground state,” Leavitt said. “We are cautiously optimistic about a big victory tomorrow night as long as everyone turns out to vote.” .@kleavittnh: Our internal polls have President Trump leading in every key battleground state. We are cautiously optimistic about a big victory tomorrow night as long as everyone turns out to vote. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/Rhust5N1no — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) November 4, 2024 Leavitt added that “early voting trends” indicate that people are going to the polls and the numbers seem to favor Republicans in “every” swing state. She also suggested Democrats are struggling in certain areas, as “urban turnout is down compared to what it was in 2020” and “female turnout for Kamala Harris is down compared to those that turned out early for Joe Biden” in the 2020 election. Leavitt concluded that “all signs point to a victory tomorrow night, but we’re not taking our foot off the gas. President Trump has four rallies in battleground states today. And we need everyone to get out and vote.” Two senior advisors similarly told The Daily Wire that they are “cautiously optimistic” about the election. As it turns out, Harris’ campaign is also feeling “cautiously optimistic,” NBC News Washington Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor reported over the weekend. “Senior Harris campaign officials say their internal data show they are winning battleground voters who have made up their minds in the last week by double digits,” Alcindor added. “Still, Harris is doing everything possible to avoid the Blue Wall crumbling like it did in 2016,” she continued, and therefore Harris was campaigning in the swing state of Michigan. Alcindor said a Harris aide told her they have a “big operation” focused on Dearborn, which has a large Muslim community, amid uncertainty about whether they will turn away from the VP this election because of conflict in Gaza. On Friday, RealClearPolitics reporter Philip Wegmann said on X a senior Harris campaign official claimed Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden “crystalized” the choice of swing state voters who made up their mind to back the VP in the last week.

Former President Donald Trump plans to blitz through three battleground states on Monday, while Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to focus on Pennsylvania with Election Day just hours away. Trump is scheduled to hold rallies in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, while Harris will spend the day campaigning in the Keystone State. The latest polling shows that Trump has a narrow lead in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and Harris has a slight edge in Michigan. The final day of campaigning comes as tens of millions of Americans have already voted, and the candidates have spent hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump will begin Monday morning in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he will speak at the J.S. Dorton arena at 10:00 a.m. Trump, who won the state in both 2016 and 2020, also visited the Tar Heel State on Saturday and Sunday, where he held rallies in Gastonia, Greensboro, and Kinston. Next, Trump will head to Pennsylvania for events in Reading and Pittsburgh. On Sunday, he rallied in Lititz, where he urged his supporters to show up to the polls on Tuesday. “You need to get out and vote, it’s very simple,” Trump said. “For the past nine years, we’ve been fighting against the most sinister and corrupt forces anywhere on earth. With your vote in this election you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Trump’s last event on Monday will be in Grand Rapids, Michigan, scheduled to begin at 10:30 p.m. In 2016 and 2020, Trump also closed out his campaigns in Grand Rapids. Harris is holding events in Scranton, Allentown, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. The stops in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia will feature celebrities like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ricky Martin, The Roots, and Oprah Winfrey. “We need you to vote, Pennsylvania. We need you to vote,” Harris said last week during an event in Harrisburg. “No one can sit on the sidelines.” Harris spent the weekend campaigning in Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina. Harris’ running mate, Governor Tim Walz (D-MN), will spend Monday in the Midwest, visiting the Wisconsin cities of La Crosse, Stevens Point, and Milwaukee before heading to Detroit, Michigan. Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Senator JD Vance will visit four battleground states on Monday, holding events in La Crosse, Wisconsin; Flint, Michigan; Atlanta, Georgia; and Newtown, Pennsylvania.

Jewish voters in Pennsylvania see an ad claiming Harris will “stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself,” CNN reported, while Arab voters in Michigan will see an ad claiming Harris “will not be silent about the human suffering occurring in Gaza.” The mixed messaging highlights the struggle Harris and Democrats have in attempting to court the pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel wing of their party – like the anti-Israel protesters on college campuses – and Jewish voters. In Facebook ads targeting voters in Pennsylvania, a clip of Harris’ speech at the Democratic National Committee is featured. “And let me be clear,” Harris says. “I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on October 7, including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival.” “And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists,” she adds. As CNN noted, the ad doesn’t include two paragraphs from Harris’ speech – taken from between the two featured lines – where she calls the “suffering” in Gaza “heartbreaking.” The ad ignores the belief held by many critics that Harris passed over Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro for her vice presidential nominee because he is Jewish and pro-Israel. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Facebook ads targeting voters in Michigan feature Harris’ other speeches, where she had expressed sympathy for those in Gaza. “What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,” Harris says in the ad. “Our common humanity compels us to act,” she says at another point in the ad. Harris is attempting to court a dangerous sect of left-wing protesters, hundreds of whom spent the past year on college campuses defending the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. As The Daily Wire previously reported, the Ivy League colleges that have coddled these students have seen sharp drops in donations. At Harvard, the university’s endowment dropped by $151 million – 14% – in fiscal year 2024 following ongoing anti-Israel protests that have turned off several billionaire donors. Columbia University also saw a major backlash during its annual “Giving Day,” where donations dropped nearly 30% after the school allowed anti-Israel protests to linger on campus, The Daily Wire reported . For the first time, the university experienced a massive drop in donations after pausing the event in 2023 following the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, the Columbia Spectator reported.

Without publicly disavowing her past positions on unpopular policies like banning fracking or mandatory gun buybacks, her aides insisted to media outlets that she had changed her mind on these issues. This is despite the fact that Harris herself said her “values have not changed.” But there is another list of issues that neither Harris nor her team have said she still supports. Typically Left-leaning outlet Axios published a list of such policies on Sunday, noting that “Harris is the ‘no comment’ candidate — purposely and strategically. She has calculated that it’s safer to be vague on policy matters than lampooned as a flip-flopper or left-winger.” Of course, that means voters who support her don’t have any actual clue what she actually supports – and that’s the way Harris and her campaign want it. Here’s the list of things Harris has supported in the past but has refused to say whether she still supports, per Axios: In addition, Harris’ campaign wouldn’t tell CNN where she stood on two additional issues she held in 2019 during her first run for president: “Federal prisoners and detained immigrants obtaining taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries” and “an open-ended pledge to ‘end’ immigration detention.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Axios also asked the Harris campaign if she still supported the following past positions, but the campaign declined to comment: Harris’ refusal to say where she is on certain issues has allowed former President Donald Trump’s campaign to tie her to President Joe Biden, whom Harris replaced as the Democratic nominee.

The Kamala Harris campaign is allegedly manipulating numerous Internet platforms, and possibly breaking rules, to artificially boost her popularity and evade fact-checks on false content. An investigation from The Federalist uncovered what appears to be a vast astroturfing operation run on Discord by paid Harris staffers. Both Reddit and X, according to the report, have been manipulated to help Harris – allegations that follow reporting about the Harris team engaging in shady practices on Google to effectively rewrite headlines of legacy news media articles, again, to boost Harris. On Reddit, Harris staffers allegedly direct volunteers to post specific content to specific threads, and up-vote or down-vote certain posts – effectively spamming threads and seemingly breaking platform rules. The apparent goal is to make Harris appear more popular than she is, and promote content that helps Harris, even if it’s not true. For example, staffers have allegedly directed the boosting of Project 2025 content, which they tie to former President Donald Trump, even though Trump is not connected to the plan. In the matter of 15 days, the staffers were able to get thousands of posts published, and the content has received more than 5.7 million upvotes, and over 400,000 comments, the report says. It was also uncovered that 126 of the top 1,000 posts on the mega-popular “Politics” subreddit, in just the past month, were allegedly published by Harris campaign volunteers. On X, another hugely influential platform for politics, Harris staffers are directing similar activity from volunteers. One goal from the camp is to block “community notes” that are unfavorable to Harris. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Community notes are basically fact-checks on X, which appear under misleading or outright false posts. Under Elon Musk’s leadership, contributors can add a community note, which is voted on by users to determine if it will be publicly attached to content or not. When Harris campaign staffers direct volunteers to mass “dislike” an unfavorable community note, it won’t appear. This is likely why pro-Harris accounts have been able to spread falsehoods without fact-checks attached to them. Even CNN, an outlet extremely hostile to Trump, has reported on the routine false information being spewed from “KamalaHQ,” the official Harris camp X account. The same goes for other pro-Harris accounts that appear to be working for the Biden-Harris administration, too. Google has played a role in the deception, too. Aside from the company’s documented bias against Trump, it also permitted the Harris campaign to change headlines and subheadings of mainstream articles to appear more favorable to Harris, left-leaning outlet Axios exposed over the summer. For example, if one were to conduct a Google search related to health care, they might get a link to an NPR story that’s sponsored by the Harris team. The campaign, however, in numerous instances, has edited that headline and subheadline. In one case, the story would now appear with the headline, “Harris will lower health care costs.” In other words, users would think they’re reading a preview for an NPR story, while they’re actually reading content from the Harris camp. The news organizations whose content was being manipulated, such as USA Today, the Associated Press, NPR, and others, were unaware of the changes. Also of note, the Trump campaign does not engage in this shady practice. On Wednesday, “Reddit Lies,” the account that broke the story, said it was banned from the campaign-run Discord server that’s organizing the astroturfing operation, indicating the Harris team is likely aware the operation has been exposed. The Harris-Walz volunteer discord server just banned my account. We expected this. That’s why we quietly archived the server over the past week and are now releasing the files to the broader public. Deadman’s switch.https://t.co/0Sud1WxbqQ — Reddit Lies (@reddit_lies) October 30, 2024 Additionally, Musk has already reacted to the allegations concerning X, announcing he’s opened an investigation into the Harris team’s antics.

"41","https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-most-absurd-dei-moments-under-biden-harris","The Most Absurd DEI Moments Under Biden-Harris","These DEI ""achievements"" reveal how backwards and incompetent our government has become over the past four years. There’s been a lot of very negative coverage of diversity, equity and inclusion lately. Some of you may know that, as I’ve mentioned once or twice, I recently put together a movie on the topic: “Am I Racist?” Streaming on Daily Wire right now. I’ve also done a lot of shows about DEI and for good reason. In fact, a DEI candidate is on the ballot for president of the United States. We are on the cusp of either doubling down on this disastrous ideology, or possibly eradicating it entirely. All that being said, I’d be lying if I said that, deep down, I don’t have a soft spot for certain DEI policies that the Biden-Harris administration has implemented. You see, as a certified DEI expert myself, I’m trained to recognize that not all DEI programs are equal. Some of them are just straight-up racist, sure. Virtually all of them are counterproductive. But I’m capable of identifying, based on my extensive training, some DEI policies that are really diamonds in the rough. Some of them transcend politics and stand as monuments to the unfettered ingenuity of the Biden-Harris administration. The more you think about these policies, the more you come around to the idea that maybe, just maybe, DEI is worth keeping around in some form — if only because, in many cases, these policies are hilarious. Or at least, mildly amusing. In that spirit — and because we could all use a breather going into what may be the most heated and contested presidential election since the Civil War — I’m going to rank my favorite DEI policies from the Biden-Harris administration. The group “Do No Harm” assembled a gigantic database of all the zillions of ways the administration has implemented DEI, and I’ve whittled that database down to my personal top 10 list. I’m posting that list on X, but for the purposes of this article I’ll whittle that list down even further. We’ll start with this one, which is probably the best. With very little fanfare, under the administration’s “equity” mandate, The TSA deployed new “advanced imaging technology” to, “reduce the instances of enhanced screening for trans persons.” According to the TSA, “this update eliminated the need for TSA officers to determine a passenger’s gender prior to Advanced Imaging screening.” This is a program that taxpayers spent millions of dollars to implement. But how does it work exactly? How, precisely, is imaging technology resulting in less false flags for self-identified “trans people”? Here’s one news report I found on this topic. We’ll see if they can shed some light on the situation: So before the DEI update over at TSA, the body scanner required that agents select a gender for the traveler. This is one of those things that I guess they didn’t want to elaborate on during a local news broadcast, but it’s pretty clear what’s going on here. If the machine detects that a woman has a strange object in a region of the body where a woman shouldn’t have any object at all, then the machine would sound an alarm, and the TSA agent would have to do a pat-down. But if the machine detects that object on a man’s body, it’s a little less suspicious. Anyone with a child’s understanding of biology can figure out that this makes a lot of sense. It’s not exactly a foolproof system, but it does make it a little harder for women to smuggle contraband through a body scanner. But the TSA, under the Biden-Harris administration, has made the technology more “accurate,” supposedly. How did that do that? According to the TSA, last summer they introduced a “gender-neutral algorithm” to the body scanners. In other words, presumably they’ve stopped looking for mismatches between someone’s gender and any objects that may be attached to their bodies in strange places. As a result, they say that the number of “false positives” has gone down by 50%. The TSA brags about that statistic on their website quite a bit — even though it doesn’t really tell us anything at all. You can reduce the number of “false positives” by 100% if you just unplug the body scanner and stop using it entirely. The more useful statistic — if we’re being frank here — would be knowing whether anyone was able to sneak a weapon through the body scanner because the machine thought it was male genitalia instead of, say, a gun or a knife. But the TSA doesn’t have those statistics because, of course, there’s no way to track objects that they missed completely. We’ll just have to find out the hard way, I guess. Hopefully ISIS doesn’t employ any gender-neutral terrorists. That brings me to another monumental DEI achievement under the Biden-Harris administration. This one comes to us from the Department of Energy, which recently became notorious for employing its own gender-neutral menace. You might have heard that the Department of Energy’s esteemed nuclear waste disposal expert, Sam Brinton, turned out to be an expert in stealing women’s luggage from airport baggage claims. That whole episode led to a lot of bad press, which is too bad because it distracted everyone from the Department of Energy’s historic achievement in the field of DEI. Fortunately, as a certified DEI professional, I’m here to rectify that oversight. This is a very real paragraph from the “Equity Action Plan” at the Department of Energy. I hope you’re sitting down for this: In Fiscal Year 2023, DOE sponsored … the Lesbians Who Tech conference. … DOE also work[ed] in close partnership with its Energy PRIDE Employee Resource Group for Pride Month, including raising the Progress Pride Flag for the third year in a row with the Energy Secretary. I’ll read that last part again. The Department of Energy raised the Progress Pride Flag three years in a row, with the Energy Secretary in attendance. They didn’t just raise the flag for one year. They didn’t just raise the flag for two years. They did it three whole years. In a row. This is something that a bureaucrat — paid by your tax dollars — wrote down in a government document as a major achievement for equity. And then they published this document online, to brag to the whole world. Just to make sure I wasn’t missing anything, I pulled up a video of what this Progress Pride “flag raising” ceremony looked like. Here’s some of that riveting footage: It’s just monumental stuff. So first of all, the Department of Energy lady says that “PRIDE” stands for “promoting respect, inclusion, diversity and equity.” That’s the first time I’ve ever heard that, but she just says it as fact. So I looked it up. It turns out that this is a disputed acronym. Most people say that PRIDE is not an acronym at all. It just means “pride,” as in, one of the seven deadly sins. But for their part, the University of San Francisco’s LGBTQ center claims that PRIDE stands for “professionalism, respect, integrity, diversity, and excellence.” So there are some differences there. Three of the five words are different. And of course when you think of gay pride parades with men walking around in leather bondage gear in front of children, the first word that comes to mind to describe the scene is: professionalism. Also respect and integrity. There’s also the folks over at Robins Air Force Base, who have weighed in on this topic, albeit in a very different context. They say on their website that PRIDE really stands for “People, Readiness, Innovation, Drive, and Excellence.” So already, this is all very confusing. And then it gets more confusing when the Department of Energy lady says this: “Pride is for everyone, whether you are a member of the community or an ally.” In other words, Pride is for everyone, except all of the people who think Pride is dumb, evil, divisive, and a complete waste of taxpayer money. So Pride isn’t really for everyone at all, I guess. But she’ll say that anyway, because it sounds nice. Speaking of pride, NASA was particularly proud under the Biden-Harris administration to launch something called “Mission Equity.” No, “Mission Equity” doesn’t refer to a trip to Mars, or catching a rocket booster mid-air so that they can reuse it later. You’re thinking too small. After all, who needs reusable rocket boosters when you have NASA’s “LGBTQI+ Gender Equity Forum,” which connects nonbinary, trans and queer folx with government procurement experts? I mean, if you give any sane person the choice between those two achievements, they’re obviously going to go with the gender equity forum. But that’s not even my favorite part of what NASA accomplished in the DEI department over the last four years. They also put together what, in my humble opinion as a DEI expert, is maybe the single creepiest DEI town hall that’s ever been put together by a government agency. One after another, the entire agency — including the director — delivered some mindless lines about Joe Biden’s executive order on equity, and how important it is. And then they announced the launch of Mission Equity. Watch: This would be a creepy and depressing town hall if it was, say, the local teachers’ union doing it. But this is NASA we’re talking about here, which makes it even harder to watch. NASA used to do great things, like land a man on the moon. And they did all of those great things without DEI. And now they’re all pretending that DEI was somehow the key to their success all along. Meanwhile, as NASA holds meetings like this — where they all act like lobotomized DEI activists — SpaceX is actually accomplishing things. There are a bunch of other examples of this rot that Do No Harm has collected. The Forest Service spent $1 billion on “environmental justice,” which is a term that no one can define. The N.E.A. spent more than $6 million to make the art world more “equitable” because, as we all know, the art world is a haven for those dreaded MAGA Republicans. The Department of Commerce allocated $70 million exclusively for “women-owned small businesses,” which is why a lot of men now list their wives as the “owner” of their company. That’s a really big improvement, I guess. We’ve incentivized fraud at a massive scale. Meanwhile, over at the CIA, they took a break from overthrowing foreign governments so that they could sponsor robotics camps for “middle school students from underserved communities.” And the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates commercial vehicles, held the first-ever meeting of the “Women of Trucking Advisory Board.” That makes sense, because if there’s one thing we desperately need as a country, it’s more women spending weeks away from their families while they drive 30-ton trucks all over the country. Of course, cataloging all of the DEI programs that the Biden-Harris administration has implemented is nearly impossible. There’s just too many of them. But having looked at the database from “Do No Harm,” those are some of my favorites. They’re the DEI “achievements” that reveal how backwards and incompetent our government has become over the past four years. And if nothing else, they’re one last incentive to vote if you haven’t already. All of this is reversible. We just have to fire the people who implemented these policies on Tuesday. And then, after we’re done laughing at these imbeciles, we can tell the next crop of government employees to get back to work.

"42","https://www.dailywire.com/news/exclusive-seven-undecided-pennsylvania-voters-say-whats-driving-their-decision","EXCLUSIVE: Seven Undecided Pennsylvania Voters Say What’s Driving Their Decision","A focus group in two bellwether counties reveals what voters like and dislike about each candidate Polling has consistently shown former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris locked in a dead heat in Pennsylvania — and the results of a recently-convened focus group shared exclusively with The Daily Wire suggest the Keystone State is still very much up for grabs. The political analytics firm Cygnal gathered seven undecided Pennsylvania voters from Erie and Northampton Counties, which have gone for the winner of every presidential election since 2008. While voters largely agreed with Trump’s policy proposals, they were put off by his personality. However, the participants also dinged Harris for “flip-flopping,” and even those who are leaning towards the Democrat said they were put off by her aggressive focus on abortion. With polls showing Trump and Harris essentially tied going into election week, the winner of this key swing state may come down to which candidate can make a direct, relatable pitch to Pennsylvanians. “They’re both kind of touring with celebrities and making it all about them,” said Tiffany, a Republican between the ages of 30 and 44 who voted for Trump in 2020, but now thinks she’s more likely to vote for Harris. “That’s not resonating, that’s not fixing anything, that’s not discussing the issues. That’s just making it about yourself.” The candidates seem to understand what’s at stake: both Trump and Harris are scheduled to spend the last day before the election in Pittsburgh. Like voters across the country, the focus group participants were largely focused on the economy. Mike, an independent between the ages of 45 and 54 who voted for a third-party candidate in 2020, spoke for much of the group when he talked about the impact of inflation. “Today, I stopped at the grocery store. I needed two packs of batteries, some hotdog buns, and something else, and it was like $40 bucks,” Mike said. “We can’t sustain this level, especially when I haven’t seen a pay increase in four years.” Inflation was the dominant theme of the conversation: participants mentioned rising costs more than 40 times in the two-hour session. “What matters to me is when I go to the grocery store, I can’t afford to buy groceries for my family,” said Rachel, a Democrat between the ages of 30 and 44 who voted for Biden in 2020. “I have to pull from my savings. You step into a grocery store now and your bill’s already at $70 no matter what you pick up. That’s what matters to me.” For all the concern about inflation, however, none of the voters thought much of Harris’s pledge to impose price controls on groceries and other goods. Even those currently leaning toward Harris said they were very concerned about excessive government spending and the growing national debt. These voters say they would like to see less American wealth going overseas, an issue Trump has been hammering. “We need to find a way to get rid of our debt and pay it down, such as calling in all the loans we’ve given to foreign nations recently,” Tiffany said. One thing that isn’t likely to solidify Tiffany’s vote for Harris: abortion. Though abortion is a top issue for pro-choice women like Tiffany, she said that she finds some of Harris’ abortion ads offensive. “I don’t like it being used as a scare tactic,” she said. “Some of these commercials are like, as a woman, I should want to vote for a pro-choice candidate because I could get raped and need an abortion. I find that a little inappropriate for campaigning.” Jamie, a Republican between the ages of 45 and 54 who voted for Trump in 2020 but is currently undecided, said she was also bothered by the Democrat’s focus on abortion. “We have one candidate who believes in restrictions, and we have one candidate that thinks abortion should be given to a woman up until the point of the baby being actually born,” Jamie said. “It is a big reason why I don’t like Kamala Harris.” If one thing was alienating voters from Trump, it was his personality. Asked to describe what animal comes to mind when they think of the former president, most offered unflattering comparisons. Rachel said “peacock,” because “everything he does is based on how it makes him look.” “He has to look good,” she said. “So whether he perpetuates lies, whether he has to make things up, as long as it makes him look good, then that’s what’s going to be said.” Another said Trump brings to mind an ape because he’s strong but ham-fisted, while another described him as a bull in a china shop. A fourth said Trump was like “a pigeon because a lot of times he just s***s on everything.” Several participants worry that Trump’s style could hurt the United States on the world stage. When asked what advice they would give Trump to win their vote, several offered some variation of “show more humility.” But voters aren’t necessarily enamored with Harris, either. Multiple participants said the vice president reminds them of a “chameleon,” perhaps the worst label a political candidate can get. “Stop being so flip-floppy, so that people actually know where you stand on issues, and you can trust that you’re going to do what you say you’re going to do,” said Rachel, one of the voters leaning to Harris.

CNN’s Jake Tapper fact-checked Vice President Kamala Harris’ lie that former President Donald Trump was talking about abortion when he said he wanted to “protect women” whether they “like it or not,” when the comment was made about protecting women and children from illegal criminal migrants and missiles from foreign adversaries. During a panel on “The Lead,” the anchor played the quote by Harris and called her out for changing it to fit a narrative about Trump being a misogynist. “When Trump said he was going to do something for women, whether they like it or not, ‘whether the women like it or not,’ he was talking about protecting women, protecting women whether they like it or not,” Tapper told the panel. “Certainly, you can take issue with the language, but he wasn’t saying he was just going to do whatever he wanted, regardless.” “But you take my point,” he added. “He’s saying I’m gonna protect them, whether women want me to protect them.” When he got pushback from some on the panel, the CNN anchor replied, “It’s not as she presented it. … So just quote it accurately.” At a rally in Phoenix on Thursday, the Kamala said, “Now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump’s not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote, and here’s where I’m going to quote, ‘whether the women like it or not.’ We must vote because this is the thing. You know, there’s a saying that you got to listen to people when they tell you who [they] are, and this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Trump’s actual quote was, “Kamala has imported criminal migrants from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and mental institutions all over the world, from Venezuela to the Congo, including savage criminals who assault, rape, and murder our women and girls.” “Anyone who would let monsters kidnap and kill our children does not belong anywhere near the Oval Office,” he added, noting that his team weeks ago told him not to say he wanted to protect women and children. “I said why? I’m president. I want to protect the women and children of our country. … I said, ‘Well, I’m gonna do it whether the women like it or not.’ I’m gonna protect them. I’m gonna protect them from migrants coming in.

"44","https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamala-prepares-for-her-final-campaign-push-in-pennsylvania","Here’s How Kamala Harris Is Spending Her Last Days On The Campaign Trail","The two candidates are neck-and-neck in the all-important swing state. Vice President and Democratic nominee for president Kamala Harris is ending her campaign with a final push in the all-important swing state of Pennsylvania, holding rallies and running a new advertisement with the state’s governor. The rust-belt swing state, with its 19 electoral votes, is the most populous and the most consequential state out of the seven battleground states. Pennsylvania is considered by many to be a must-win for the Democratic nominee, who would have a significantly more challenging path to victory if she is unable to sweep through the rust belt states. Harris is now making her final push in the Keystone State, announcing plans to rally in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on the eve of the election and launching a new ad with Governor Josh Shapiro. Harris just recently rallied in Philadelphia, encouraging residents of the state to vote and hitting on the issues of abortion, the economy, and gun violence. Current polling averages have Harris and former president Donald Trump neck-and-neck in the state, with Trump holding a slim 0.4 percent lead. Her new advertisement in Pennsylvania features the state’s governor Josh Shapiro, formerly a contender for Harris’ running mate before she opted for Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. “Do you want more chaos? Or like me, are you ready for some common sense? That’s why I’m with Kamala,” Shapiro says in the advertisement. “She’s practical, and she gets stuff done.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “As president, I will chart a new way forward and find solutions to create jobs and bring down costs,” Harris states in the ad. Harris’ final ad in Pennsylvania is narrated by Josh Shapiro with him sitting next to Harris. (Shapiro was on the VP shortlist) More from @JuliaTerruso https://t.co/3phmi6e13c pic.twitter.com/6QEXnq7n9X — Alex Thompson (@AlexThomp) November 1, 2024 Harris has taken heavy criticism for her decision to name Walz her running mate instead of Shapiro, with critics alleging that the Democratic candidate decided against the Pennsylvania governor over his support for Israel in its war effort, as well as his Jewish background. One advertisement from the League of American Workers hits Harris over her decision, saying that she “passed over the very popular governor of Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro because of his identity.” Election analysts report that Harris’ clearest path to victory relies on her sweeping the three rust belt swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Trump would take the presidency if he won any of those three states while also winning Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. “If Kamala Harris sweeps the Rust Belt while Trump takes the Sun Belt states, she would win with exactly 270 electoral votes, the absolute minimum needed to emerge victorious,” Nicholas Creel, an associate professor of business law at Georgia College & State University, wrote in Newsweek. Trump, meanwhile, has a more varied set of potential paths to victory and could surpass the required 270 electoral votes to take the presidency by winning Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and either Wisconsin or Michigan, even if he lost both Nevada and Pennsylvania.

Former president Donald Trump’s campaign has filed a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint against the Washington Post, accusing the publication of making “illegal corporate in-kind contributions to Harris for President.” The FEC complaint cites a Semafor report on how the Washington Post pays to boost stories “critical of Trump as subscribers flee,” a story that mentions how the Washington Post “aggressively ramped up its paid advertising campaign, boosting dozens of articles related to the election,” starting Monday, Oct. 28. The Post was boosting generally positive stories about Kamala Harris, the report says. “The facts support a reasonable inference that The Washington Post made, and Harris for President accepted, an illegal corporate contribution in the form of coordinated communications,” the complaint states. “Therefore, the Commission should find reason to believe a violation has occurred, conduct an immediate investigation, and assess an appropriate sanction for this corporate interference in our elections.” In a letter sent Oct. 31, Trump deputy general counsel Gary Lawkowski writes that “on the eve of the 2024 general election,” the Washington Post is reportedly “conducting a dark money corporate campaign in opposition to President Donald J. Trump — pretextually using its own online advertising efforts to promote Kamala Harris’s presidential candidacy.” “There is reason to believe that the Washington Post violated the Federal Election Campaign Act and Federal Election Commission regulations by making illegal corporate in-kind contributions,” he wrote. “Therefore, we call upon the Commission to immediately investigate expenditures by The Washington Post.” I smell an FEC complaint this is classic election interference Washington Post pays to boost stories critical of Trump as subscribers flee | Semafor https://t.co/UaV1yVB7Gv — Chris LaCivita (@LaCivitaC) October 30, 2024 The Washington Post has drawn backlash from its readers and writers after it announced last week that it would not endorse a presidential candidate. Owner Jeff Bezos defended the announcement, saying that “presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election.” The Federal Election Campaign Act makes it unlawful for corporations “to make a contribution or expenditure in connection with any election to any political office . . . or for any candidate, political committee, or other person knowingly to accept or receive any contribution,” the complaint notes. “According to reports, the Post is using its advertising powers to promote pro-Kamala and anti-Trump coverage to voters in the final days of the election,” the Trump campaign said in a release. “While they declined to endorse her publicly, they have endorsed her in the dark; so much for ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness.'” “The mainstream media has become nothing more than pro-Kamala propaganda,” the Trump campaign added. “The Democrat machine must be held accountable.” The complaint notes that the Washington Post should not be able to “avail itself” of the FECA’s “press” or “media” exemption for its advertising. Lawkowski writes that by “boosting content to influence the election, The Washington Post is acting as like any other partisan player in the election process, not in its capacity as a press entity.” It continues: “The Washington Post’s public advertising efforts in coordination with the Harris campaign is ‘core electioneering activity’ and thus not protected under the media exemption.” The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Officials in the Biden-Harris White House altered the official transcript of President Joe Biden’s remarks earlier this week where he referred to tens of millions of supporters of former President Donald Trump as “garbage.” The Associated Press reported that the fraudulent alteration of official government records drew objections from the federal workers who document all of the president’s remarks for historical reference. Official White House stenographers recorded Biden stating: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” However, Biden-Harris officials altered the quote by adding an apostrophe, changing it to “supporter’s” instead of “supporters.” The change was made only after the White House press team “conferred with the president,” according to an email obtained by the publication. Federal officials pushed back, noting that the interference by the White House was “a breach of protocol and spoilation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “If there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,” the supervisor wrote. “Our Stenography Office transcript — released to our distro, which includes the National Archives — is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.” The supervisor, who is a career White House employee, said that urgency of a transcript’s release was not their concern and that what mattered was that it was authentic and legitimate. The edit came as the administration tried to contain the fallout from Biden’s remarks during the final days of the presidential race. House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and House Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer (R-KY) on Wednesday accused White House staff of “releasing a false transcript” of Biden’s remarks, and said that they were considering opening an investigation into the matter. “Unsurprising too were the White House’s actions after he said them,” they said in a joint statement. “Instead of apologizing or clarifying President Biden’s words, the White House instead sought to change them (despite them being recorded on video) by releasing a false transcript of his remarks.” “The move is not only craven, but it also appears to be in violation of federal law, including the Presidential Records Act of 1978,” they added. “White House staff cannot rewrite the words of the President of the United States to be more politically on message. Though President Biden’s relevance continues to diminish, his words continue to matter, even as they become increasingly divisive and erratic.” Already have an account?

"47","https://www.dailywire.com/news/defend-our-country-imprisoned-pro-life-activists-urge-americans-to-vote-against-kamala","‘Defend Our Country’: Imprisoned Pro-Life Activists Urge Americans To Vote Against Kamala","'Sadly, as a federal felon I can not vote,' one wrote from prison. 'But I can ask all Americans to vote, and I ask them to defend our country.' Pro-lifers jailed by the Biden-Harris administration for their activism are anxiously awaiting the results of the 2024 election. One candidate has promised to pardon them — the other candidate is part of the administration that locked them up. The Daily Wire spoke to a number of these prisoners, who are in jail for violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, a law protecting abortion clinics under which pro-life activists can be charged for blocking or inhibiting a woman from getting an abortion. As prisoners, they cannot vote. But they strongly urge their fellow pro-life activists and Americans not to support Kamala Harris, who supports unlimited abortions and who targeted pro-life activist David Daleiden and pro-life pregnancy centers during her time as California attorney general. “Paulette is one of many peaceful pro-lifers who Joe Biden has rounded up, sometimes with SWAT teams, and thrown them in jail,” Donald Trump said in June as he spoke at the Faith and Freedom Coalition, referring to 75-year-old pro-life activist Paulette Harlow. “Many people are in jail over this. … We’re going to get that taken care of immediately — [on the] first day.” He added that he will “rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner who’s unjustly victimized by the Biden regime, including Paulette, so we can get them out of the gulags and back to their families where they belong.” All of the prisoners who spoke with The Daily Wire mentioned this promise. “For the past fourteen months I, along with eight other anti-abortion rescuers convicted of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) have been incarcerated in Federal correctional institutions, praying Donald Trump will be elected and make good on his promise to pardon us,” wrote Jonathan Darnel, imprisoned for trying to stop abortions from taking place at a Washington, D.C., abortion clinic. He spoke with The Daily Wire from the Federal Corrections Institution Thomson in Illinois, where he will be imprisoned until February 2026. As he spoke, the prison’s automated message interrupted him: “This call is from a federal prison.” After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, the Biden Justice Department was clear that it would use FACE to target pro-lifers as a response to the Supreme Court decision. Roe’s overturn increased “the urgency” of the Justice Department’s work, said Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, including the “enforcement of the FACE Act, to ensure continued lawful access to reproductive services.” Darnel, Lauren Handy, Herb Geraghty, Heather Idoni, Jean Marshall, Joan Bell, William Goodman, and John Hinshaw all believe that abortion is the murder of an unborn child. They sought to stop abortions from taking place by praying or singing in front of abortion clinic entrances — and the Biden-Harris Justice Department imprisoned them all. Most of these pro-life activists are frustrated with Trump over his stances on abortion, but they expressed much stronger fears about a potential Harris administration. And they are grateful for Trump’s promise to free them. “If Harris becomes president I would not be surprised if myself and my fellow Rescuers receive more indictments and lawsuits,” Handy told The Daily Wire. “She is an enemy to the pre-born and to activists alike.” Handy is imprisoned in FCI, Tallahassee, a low-se­cu­ri­ty fed­er­al women’s prison, where The Daily Wire unsuccessfully attempted to visit her last week. Outside the massive prison, birds chirped and a soft breeze swept the premises, occasionally carrying female chatter with it. Otherwise, the place was eerily silent. This is the federal prison where the Biden/Harris DOJ locked up pro-life activist Lauren Handy for trying to stop abortions/save unborn babies in D.C. She’s incarcerated in the same prison as Ghislaine Maxwell, infamous cohort of Jeffrey Epstein. pic.twitter.com/xHmjlCTpSV — Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) October 31, 2024 Razor wire surrounds the premises. Visitors must wear very specific, modest clothing and predetermined clothing colors, or they will be sent away. Handy told The Daily Wire that “every time someone comes to visit me in person, I get strip searched naked.” FCI Tallahassee houses some notorious female criminals — Ghislaine Maxwell, for example, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s female cohort, is imprisoned there. Colleen R. LaRose, known as “Jihad Jane,” a woman convicted of attempting to “wage violent jihad in South Asia and Europe,” also served time in FCI Tallahassee, as did Russian secret agent Maria Butina. Handy is housed with such notorious women for her part in “rescues” — pro-lifers’ attempts to stop abortions from taking place. She’s one of the duo who recovered the bodies of five preemie-sized aborted baby bodies from Washington Surgi-Clinic in Washington, D.C., where she believes abortionist Cesare Santangelo is performing illegal abortions. The District of Columbia refuses to investigate the matter. “I am doing good all things considered,” she wrote. “There is much to be done to advance a culture of life in prison so I find myself feeling productive and hopeful.” William Goodman is another pro-lifer imprisoned in FCI Danbury, 14 months into a 27-month sentence for attempting to stop abortions from taking place at Washington Surgi-Clinic in 2020, like Darnel and Handy. He says he was housed with Steven Bannon, who was released from prison on Tuesday, and several January 6 prisoners. “Even though I wish none of them had been arrested and imprisoned,” he wrote, “their companionship has been a blessing.” Goodman, in messages to The Daily Wire sent from the Connecticut prison, described the upcoming election in serious terms. “This is an existential battle between good and evil, between life and death, between truth and lies, between sincerity and deception, between the First Amendment and censorship, between representative democracy and the administrative state, between those who love our nation and elite globalists, between freedom and state control, between our nation as a republic or as a tyranny,” he wrote. “As our divided nation splits into two different worldviews, the heart and soul of America lies in the balance,” he continued. “Are we or are we not ‘one nation under God?’ I believe we are one nation UNDER GOD! I believe we need to pray and take action as patriots. And I know I am not alone. There are millions and millions of Americans who feel this way too.” Goodman argued that the Harris-Walz ticket is “disgusting,” given that they have “made the killing of innocent babies the first priority of their administration.” He reflected on how Harris has described the right to choose as the bedrock of democracy, writing: “Such violent policy is clearly very harmful to mothers, fathers, as well as our whole nation, and obviously — it’s completely deadly for the most innocent & defenseless of all God’s children.” “Sadly, as a federal felon I can not vote,” he wrote. “But I can ask all Americans to vote, and I ask them to defend our country and vote against the evil of the Harris-Walz agenda which opposes Almighty God in so many abominable ways.” Some of the prisoners described their deep moral qualms with the election, especially since neither candidate supports the full abortion platform that they desire. Specifically, Trump has said that he would not sign a national law protecting the unborn — a move that many Republicans view as a political necessity, but many pro-lifers took as a betrayal. “If Trump is elected, we’ll be pardoned,” said Darnel. “If Harris is elected, more activists may be arrested. So of course I hope Trump becomes president. But which outcome is more conducive to the end of abortion? That, I cannot tell you.” “I encourage people to expand their view of what it means to be involved politically,” Handy said. “I believe we can create pro-life power through direct action, mutual aid and trans-local organizing. Pro-lifers should vote in a way aligns with their values.” While the Biden-Harris DOJ has targeted pro-life activists, it has largely ignored the hundreds of pro-abortion attacks on Catholic Churches and pro-life pregnancy centers since the May 2022 leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion indicating Roe v. Wade would soon be overturned. The FACE Act also protects pregnancy centers and Catholic Churches, and critics have argued that the Justice Department has weaponized the law to leverage it against pro-life activists. “Nearly every single prosecution of alleged violence against abortion clinics has involved application of the FACE Act despite the lack of enforcement on attacks against churches and pregnancy resource centers,” Catholic Vote’s Brian Burch argued to the DOJ this summer. “What policies are in place at the DOJ which contribute to this imbalance, and what is being done to rectify it?” The pro-life activists who emailed The Daily Wire from prison believe they were targeted. “Most cannot believe that we are in prison for defending innocent babies!” wrote Goodman, describing his fellow prisoners. “They think it’s crazy the federal government has come after us with such hostility. Their honesty and sincerity is refreshing. Many of the fellas have expressed their sadness over their wives or girlfriends killing their babies by abortion. Their stories are heartbreaking to hear.” As Darnel spoke to The Daily Wire on the phone, he paused his story as loud shouting and footsteps sounded in the background. “Oh, I think I gotta go, everybody’s rushing off to lunch,” he said quickly. “I’m sorry it had to be so abrupt.” Already have an account?

"48","https://www.dailywire.com/news/crime-in-philadelphia-isnt-going-anywhere-in-kamala-harris-america","Crime In Philadelphia Isn’t Going Anywhere In Kamala Harris’ America","Improved stats are an election year mirage, not a sign of real change. A party in North Philadelphia descended into chaos earlier this month when a juvenile boy fired off 50 rounds, injuring seven people and leaving one 16-year-old girl in critical condition. At one point in time, stories like this were unthinkable. Then, they were rare. But now, incidents like this are routine in Philadelphia. Rather than facing this human suffering head-on, Philadelphia progressives are desperate to spin a different narrative about crime in their city. With an election just around the corner, headline after headline after headline is touting that crime is down. District Attorney Larry Krasner earlier this year predicted “the largest reduction in violent crime in recorded history in the United States.” And Vice President Kamala Harris has been adamant that crime rates have declined during her administration. For its part, the Philadelphia police department is claiming a 40% year-to-date decrease in homicides in 2024 and a 42% reduction in shootings. As the City’s website readily admits, however, these crime data are “preliminary,” which means they will likely be revised upward as the year continues. And they may even be even edited retroactively, as the FBI recently did for national crime statistics to cover up how unsafe America’s streets have become. Regardless, is the narrative true that Philadelphia has begun to solve its crime problem? Unfortunately, it’s not. While the short-term decrease in crime during an election year might seem encouraging, the reality is that it isn’t indicative of real change. Violence in Philadelphia is still at historic highs. To understand why, some perspective is in store. From 2013 to 2017, Philadelphia averaged 271 homicides per year. But then something happened. From 2018 through 2023, there was an average of 457 per year. Black people represented 83 percent of those victims. The same drastic jump in crime applied to shooting incidents, which increased from a five-year average of 1,047 per year to 1,588 per year. And aggravated assault while armed with a handgun, went from a five-year average of 2,209 per year to 3,116 per year. And retail thefts, which went from a five-year average of 7,412 per year to 9,084 per year. And auto theft skyrocketed from a five-year average of 5,691 to 8,665 per year. So, what happened in 2018? Larry Krasner happened. He was elected as the 26th District Attorney of Philadelphia, thanks in part to $1.7 million in funding from progressive billionaire George Soros. At the time, Vice President Kamala Harris also vocally supported Krasner, calling his victory “key to criminal justice reforms like rolling back mass incarceration and ending cash bail.” Unfortunately for the citizens of Philadelphia, Harris was right. Krasner’s policies would reflect the pro-crime agenda of his radical benefactor and lead to a massive increase in crime which has completely transformed the city. On his first day in office, Krasner fired 31 experienced violent crimes prosecutors, who he viewed as “ticks.” Then, he pursued new radical policies such as making retail theft of less than $500 worth of goods a petty crime, instructing all his assistant district attorneys to stop seeking bail on low-level charges, and lowering charges for first- and second-degree murderers. These policies earned Krasner the affectionate title “Uncle Larry” from Philadelphia’s criminals. And unless Uncle Larry is removed from office, Philadelphia’s improved 2024 crime numbers will prove to be what they are: an election year illusion and an embarrassment when put in their proper historical perspective. It doesn’t have to be this way. The people of Philadelphia should be able to live in a safe city, and not just during presidential election cycles when radical Democrats like Kamala Harris are trying win their vote. Thankfully, the solutions are simple, and conservatives are ready to deliver them. So are some moderate Democrats who already work in the city. Mayor Cherelle Parker, who ran directly opposed to Kamala Harris’ progressive orthodoxy on crime and called for the city to hire hundreds more police officers, is a good example. So is Police Chief Kevin Bethel, whom Parker appointed in January. Since becoming the city’s top cop, Bethel and his officers have implemented a curfew in high-crime areas, cracked down on people driving illegal ATVs and dirt bikes, and removed long-standing encampments. Conservatives and public safety advocates have been advancing all of these are commonsense policies for years. Bethel attributes some of his success to collaborating with “federal partners” such as “ATF and DEA and FBI and Homeland Security.” But all Bethel’s good police work won’t count for anything if Krasner continues to let criminals off the hook. And the collaboration he counts on could end abruptly if Vice President Harris is elected and implements her “defund the police” agenda. As she explained recently on “The Breakfast Club,” she supports the federal government playing a bigger role in setting local policing rules, restricting certain police tactics, and getting rid of qualified immunity for Philadelphia cops. To prevent horrific shootings like the one that occurred earlier this month and permanently put a stop to crime in their city, Philadelphians need to see beyond short-term statistics and recent headlines and place the blame where it belongs: with progressive Democrats like Larry Krasner and Kamala Harris trying to take credit for reducing crime rates that their radical policies caused to spike in the first place. * * * Kevin Roberts is the president of Heritage Action for America.

Harris addressed the crowd at the Ellipse just north of the Washington Monument and in view of the White House, casting Trump as a “wannabe dictator” and a tyrant in a speech billed by her campaign and media alike as the candidate’s “closing argument.” “America, we know what Donald Trump has in mind. More chaos. More division,” Harris said to the crowd, which her campaign claims included an estimated 75,000 attendees. “The United States of America is not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators.” Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, have sought to label Trump a fascist and compare him to the Nazis. These attacks contradict President Joe Biden’s call for Americans to “lower the temperature” after Trump narrowly escaped death when a would-be assassin attempted to kill him in Butler, Pennsylvania. As Harris blasted Trump, far-left protesters gathered just outside the rally, often drowning out her speech with cries that Harris was complicit in genocide in Gaza. The protesters jeered and banged pots and pans as Harris first took the stage as supporters of the Democratic candidate attempted to watch her on a screen. The clash is the latest evidence of a growing split in the Democratic Party, one that could impact Harris’ chances in swing states like Michigan, where there is a large Muslim population. One protester made it past a line of police and jumped onto a platform in front of the screen, waving a Palestinian flag.

I’m in DC for @realdailywire: pic.twitter.com/ovcX55fom7 — Spencer Lindquist 🇺🇸 (@SpencerLndqst) October 30, 2024 Other protesters held signs that encouraged or celebrated violence. One protester held a sign that read “vote with a f****** brick,” while another held a sign featuring pictures of what appeared to be Hamas terrorists. The man also wore a headband associated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated terrorist organization that believes in revolutionary communism. Police maintained separation between the Harris supporters and the far left-demonstrators, though the two groups engaged in shouting matches at times, with the protesters calling the supporters of the Democratic candidate “shameful.” Throughout her speech, Harris called Trump an authoritarian and a threat to the country. “This election is more than a choice between two parties and two different candidates. It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American. Or one ruled by chaos and division,” Harris said at the outset. “We all know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election that he knew he lost,” she went on to say. Trump addressed the speech at a rally in North Carolina, saying that “all she talked about was Donald Trump,” before playing a supercut of Harris saying his name during closing argument. “She and Joe have no achievements, only failure,” he said before making light of her speech. “She suffers from a very serious disease called Trump derangement syndrome … sometime referred to as TDS, it’s quite serious.” Harris again cast Trump as an authoritarian in the final moments of her speech, likening her opponent to King George III. “Nearly 250 years ago, America was born when we wrested freedom from a petty tyrant,” Harris stated. “They did not struggle, sacrifice, and lay down their lives, only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms, only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant.” In addition to presenting Trump as a dangerous authoritarian, Harris also emphasized her stance on abortion and the economy, which her supporters frequently identify as their top issues. “I will fight to restore what Donald Trump and his hand-picked Supreme Court Justices took away from the women of America,” she said, referencing abortion and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. “Trump isn’t done. He would ban abortion nationwide, restrict access to birth control and put IVF at risk, and force states to monitor women’s pregnancies,” she went on to say despite Trump repeatedly telling voters that he would leave abortion to the states. “I will enact the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on groceries, cap the price of insulin, and limit out-of-pocket prescription costs for all Americans. I will fight to make sure that hard working Americans can actually afford a place to live,” she said, addressing the cost of living. Current polling averages show Trump leading Harris by slim margins in the key swing states of Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, with the Democratic candidate holding leads in Michigan and Wisconsin.

Walsh told Fox News host Trace Gallagher that the Democrats’ uproar over jokes made at former President Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally highlights how the Left focuses on “the victim and oppressor narrative.” “And that’s all they really have,” Walsh said. “That’s kind of what lays at the bottom of the Left-wing racial ideology, which is what the DEI scam, which we expose in the film, is built on.” Gallagher played a clip of Dr. Phil blasting diversity, equity, and inclusion during a speech at Trump’s rally and asked the Daily Wire host why the Left is outraged about Dr. Phil’s comments. “Dr. Phil’s message is particularly inconvenient for the Left right now because Kamala Harris is the DEI candidate,” Walsh said. “I mean, she’s the first DEI presidential candidate, and we say that not just as some kind of slur. It’s true. She’s the first presidential candidate in history to be handed that position as the nominee without being voted in purely because she checked demographic boxes, not based on any merit, not because anybody wanted her.” Walsh also said the timing of “Am I Racist?” couldn’t have been better as Americans prepare to vote between Trump and Harris in the 2024 presidential election. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “If [Kamala] ends up in the White House, then she’s going to bring that ideology that is opposed to merit, that kills merit and puts demographics above it, and she’s going to bring that into the White House, which is not good for the country,” Walsh added. “Am I Racist?” became the most successful release in DailyWire+ history on Monday after its huge success as the company’s first theatrical release for an in-house production. It outperformed expectations at the box office, grossing more than $12 million and debuting in the top five films in the country on its opening weekend. “Am I Racist?” also became the top-grossing documentary of the decade. The film features Walsh going undercover in the world of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) to expose the grift of the race hustlers profiting off people’s emotions through deception.

Do that,' Harris told the Michigan crowd. Vice President Kamala Harris has gone viral after a clip surfaced of the crowd at her rally in Ann Arbor going completely silent after she tried to convince them to shout their own names. During Harris’ rally in Michigan on Monday, her supporters started to chant her first name — “Ka-ma-la, Ka-ma-la, Ka-ma-la” — over and over again while holding signs that read “Vote” and had Harris’ name along with her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s name on it. “Now I want each of you to shout your own name. Do that,” Harris yelled over the crowd. “Because it’s about all of us. It’s about all of us.” In the clip, people appear to be looking at the person standing next to them and looking around to see what they should do. Instead of following Harris’ instruction, the entire room just went silent and lowered their signs.

Some have reacted to the clip on social media, calling the moment “cringe,” “embarrassing,” and “awkward.” Harris’ stop in Michigan was just the beginning of a busy week — leading up to Election Day — for the VP, who remains virtually in a tie with former President Donald Trump in the swing state. Earlier in the day, Harris made headlines after another video circulated from her tour of a semiconductor plant in the state— where she asked employees whether or not she could touch something she described simply as “shiny!” as The Daily Wire reported. Harris stopped at Hemlock Semiconductors in Saginaw where she got the chance to see newly harvested silicon laid out on a table. The Vice President reached out a hand toward one of the items, which was covered in plastic, and hesitated, asking, “Can I touch it?” The response from one of the employees was immediate: “No! Do not touch it!” “Do not — I’m glad I asked,” Harris recoiled slightly, laughing. “And I won’t touch that.” “Please do not touch any of the poly — it is very sharp,” the employee repeated. “Those are very sharp.” “And shiny,” Harris agreed, still laughing. On Tuesday, the Vice President will attempt to make her final reach to voters in the 2024 campaign during a rally in Washington, D.C., on the Ellipse. Virginia Kruta contributed to this piece.

That’s because the official numbers don’t include those who were able to escape from Border Patrol, known as “gotaways.” When including gotaways, the number of illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. increased by 25%, The Telegraph reported, According to the Biden-Harris administration, about 7.15 million people have attempted to enter the country illegally since President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ first full month in office. But a Freedom of Information request from the Telegraph found that Border Patrol believes another 1.8 million illegal immigrants crossed the U.S. borders without being apprehended, for a total of around 8.95 million. Simon Hankinson, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who focuses on immigration, told the Telegraph he thought the administration was engaging in “deliberate obfuscation.” “They have essentially laundered illegal immigration,” he added. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Gotaways aren’t traditionally included in official figures, even under Republican presidents, but it’s no secret that illegal immigration increased exponentially under the Biden-Harris administration. It has particularly increased in swing states since 2021, The Daily Wire reported, adding to concerns that Democrats are using illegal immigration in an attempt to win elections. A report from MarketWatch found that Michigan saw a 775% increase in its population of illegal immigrants since 2021, an increase that can make a real difference in a state Biden won by 150,000 votes in 2020 and that former President Donald Trump won by just 11,000 votes in 2016. The population of illegal immigrants rose by 734% in Arizona, where Biden beat Trump in 2020 by just 11,000 votes, and 562% in Nevada. Wisconsin’s illegal immigrant population surged by 467%, Georgia’s by 401%, and North Carolina’s by 446% in the same time frame. Pennsylvania also saw a 241% increase in its illegal immigrant population. The Biden-Harris administration is also providing “quiet amnesty” to nearly one million illegal immigrants so far, according to a report from the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee. “Through administrative maneuvering, the Biden-Harris Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security have caused the immigration court backlog to skyrocket, adding over 3.7 million new cases since fiscal year 2021,” the committee said in a press release. “Under the Biden-Harris Administration, over 700,000 illegal aliens have had their cases dismissed, terminated, or administratively closed, and the pace of these actions has increased each year, allowing those aliens to stay in the country indefinitely without facing immigration consequences,” the committee added. “The Biden-Harris Administration has used the backlog as an excuse to allow even more aliens to remain in America,” the committee said. “Instead of adjudicating cases based on the merits of their claims—such as valid asylum requests—immigration judges have rubberstamped dismissals, terminations, and closures. This quiet amnesty has become a hallmark of the Biden-Harris Administration’s immigration courts.” Already have an account? Your information could be the missing piece to an important story.

"56","https://www.dailywire.com/news/when-everyone-is-hitler-no-one-is-hitler","When Everyone Is Hitler, No One Is Hitler","The more the “H” word is casually bantered about, the less the actual crimes of Hitler himself are properly remembered. On the eve of Operation Barbarossa, Adolf Hitler’s long-desired invasion of the Soviet Union, the German high command issued a chilling edict to the Axis armies waiting for their marching orders, setting the tone for one of the most horrific and prolonged episodes of mass barbarity ever recorded. “This will be a war of annihilation,” said the German Army chief of staff, General Franz Halder, relaying the wishes of his Führer. “Commanders must make the sacrifice of overcoming their personal scruples.” Beyond the scope of Hitler’s four million-man operation spanning a front line some 1,200 miles from Finland to the Black Sea, it was the viciousness, indeed the racial hatred, that underpinned the assault on the detested Slavs, Bolsheviks, and, of course, Jews, that made this crime and others of Hitler and his Nazi hordes so unique in the annals of warfare. Barbarossa was the ultimate expression of Hitler’s megalomaniacal zeal to eradicate tens of millions of those whom he considered unworthy of sharing the same continent with his master race. The orgy of mass murder his loyal soldiers inflicted upon the people of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic States was the equivalent of over six 9/11s each day, every day, for over 1,400 days. The 27 million dead would be added to the tally of millions more murdered Poles, Greeks, French, Dutch, Belgian, Danes, British and British Commonwealthers, Americans, Norwegians, Czechs, Yugoslavs, and others, to the point where Adolf Hitler, in his hate-filled descent into bona fide madness, could claim direct responsibility for the deaths of over 36 million people. This does not even include Axis dead. This is the man to whom a desperate Democrat Party is once again shamelessly trying to link their GOP opponent, Donald Trump. Such lack of shame in making so ludicrous an analogy actually beggars the mind. More so when you consider how many Americans on the left blindly accept this comparison as even remotely valid. As such, although not surprisingly, Trump has been the target of three assassination attempts due to such demonization. After all, when you draw a nexus between him and the architect of Barbarossa, The Holocaust, and other atrocities, it is easy to see how not just the mentally unstable, but even many otherwise normal Americans fearing for their nation’s future can want the man dead. In fact, almost one-third of Democrats surveyed expressed disappointment that Trump was not felled by the bullet that took the life of an innocent father of two. That is self-evidently disturbing. But who is Donald Trump really, when you strip away the bizarre, visceral hatred for the man? As it turns out, he was a politician who was already President for 1,447 days. And the nation survived with its bedrock civil liberties well intact while the world was at relative peace. This was a man who firmly supported the Jewish state of Israel, and was, in fact, the only President in my adult lifetime to refrain from starting yet another ill-conceived war. Indeed, the only atrocities I ever saw him commit while in office were his hairdo, fast food diet, and sometimes undisciplined tongue. And, yes, he should have been more forceful in his words to try and stem a four-hour riot on Capitol Hill. With that said, I have often wondered if those who somehow compare Donald Trump (or anyone really) to Hitler have ever even heard of such nightmarish places as Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belsen, Sobibor, or Dachau. And these infamous death factories, run with the Nazis’ knack for dispassionate efficiency, are just a handful of the over 6,000 concentration camps set up throughout Germany and the conquered territories from 1933-1945. And the millions of innocents murdered in these grisly places do not even include the inhumane POW camps into which millions of Red Army prisoners were dumped and condemned to die of starvation, summary execution, torture, and disease. As just one example of the atrocities about which I’ll guarantee you the “Trump is Hitler” crew are unaware, consider Babi Yar. In September 1941 as the Wehrmacht moved through the Ukraine, Hitler’s roving SS assassins called the Einsatzgruppen, along with elements of the regular German Sixth Army, sent out an order that all Jews in Kyiv were to report for relocation. They were instructed to bring ID, money, and warm clothing. The unsuspecting Ukrainian Jews were ignorant of the Nazis’ rabid anti-Semitism; until the invasion, Stalin had forbidden negative press re: Germany as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact. Some 33,000 showed up and were subsequently ushered to the ravine of Babi Yar. Hitler’s executioners then systematically massacred them all…men, women, children, the latter of whom were often lined up and shot three at a time with one round to save ammunition. It has been said that before there was “Shoah by gas”, there was “Shoah by bullets.” And the Nazis were just getting started. Not only was Hitler fully aware of this and countless other atrocities in his name, he enthusiastically encouraged them. As for the broader Ukraine, Hitler and his Nazi henchmen vowed to strip “Europe’s breadbasket” of its grain harvest which would be spirited away to the Reich. In what they unashamedly labeled “der Hungerplan,” Hitler gleefully expected that his edict would condemn some 30 million to die of slow starvation. The very well-fed Hermann Göring, echoing his Fuhrer’s sentiments, boasted that the population would have to “eat Cossack saddles!” Those allowed to live and work the land at the behest of their German overlords would be relegated to slaves, modern helots. It is not difficult to see where Tolkien’s inspiration for his “Lord Of The Rings” series — featuring Sauron’s malice, lust for power, conquest, and drive to inflict suffering upon the people of Middle Earth — originated. Like many of us in the post-war world, I’d grown up knowing about Hitler and his crimes. But it was not until I began researching my first book that I came to understand just how close to pure evil this man was. Indeed, for Europe, Hitler’s ascent to power, and the unfathomable suffering and devastation he unleashed upon the continent in his six-year rampage of gore, was, quite simply, the worst thing to happen since the Black Death. Yet, now we must endure the latest round of “Trump is Hitler” from the Left that will try any and every approach to save Kamala Harris’ sinking campaign. Do such dubious equivalences stem from ignorance? Is it desperation? I don’t know. But I do know this: The more the “H” word is casually bantered about as the go-to analogy for anyone the Left finds disagreeable, the less the actual crimes of Hitler himself are properly remembered. Like his morally anesthetized soldiers, we become inured to them. And that is dangerous. Because, as Mark Steyn said, “When everybody’s Hitler, nobody’s Hitler.” How, then, will we know if a true successor to the man the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper referred to as “the coarsest, cruelest, least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known” is among us? That a president should choose to use his Constitutionally granted authority to secure the border and sit across the table from bad actors who command nuclear arsenals, so as to prevent a Third World War (from which humanity would never recover), while placing U.S. interests above those of the other 192 nations, does not make him the new Führer. To compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler only serves to shamelessly insult and belittle the memory of the Nazis’ tens of millions of victims. This is a truly grotesque tactic deployed at the eleventh hour to score cheap political points to salvage a campaign that is rapidly sinking under the weight of its own candidate’s incompetence, mendacity, and astounding vacuousness. When this campaign is over, no matter who wins, the Democrats will owe not just Trump, but Hitler’s victims, some still living, an apology. It is time to banish the “Hitler” analogies from the political landscape once and for all. Otherwise, I fear that, given our lack of understanding of just how horrific the real Hitler was, we may not recognize his true reincarnation when we see him. And like those poor souls of Babi Yar, we won’t come to realize just how mistaken we have been until it is too late. Already have an account?

A leading pro-Kamala Harris super PAC has told the vice president that attacking former President Donald Trump as a fascist “is not that persuasive.” With just one week left until the election, the super PAC Future Forward sent an email to Democrats saying that attacking Trump’s character by calling him a fascist isn’t working, The New York Times reported. The committee also warned that claiming Trump was “exhausted” didn’t work either. The emails have been sent regularly for months, the Times reported, but have arrived more frequently as the election draws near. The messages are meant to guide Democrats on messaging and are based on Future Forward’s analysis of clips and social media posts. The email sent Friday suggested Democrats focus on Harris’ policies, especially her economic proposals and stance on abortion. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “Purely negative attacks on Trump’s character are less effective than contrast messages that include positive details about Kamala Harris’s plans to address the needs of everyday Americans,” the email said, according to the Times. The email from Future Forward also said that Harris’ comments about former Trump chief of staff John Kelly’s dubious claims that Trump praised Adolf Hitler’s generals didn’t move the needle as much as other messages. Specifically, Harris’ comments about Kelly’s claim at a CNN town hall were much less persuasive than her appearance on Howard Stern, where she promised to expand Medicare. The Biden-Harris administration, however, implemented a plan through the falsely titled Inflation Reduction Act that would significantly increase Medicare premiums. In order to cover this up, the administration plans to give billions of dollars to private insurance companies to keep the premiums down until after the election, POLITICO reported. While the email appeared damaging enough for the Times to cover it, the president of Future Forward, Chauncey McLean, dismissed the warning in a statement to the outlet. “Don’t over-read this,” McLean told the Times. “This is just one of our regular emails sharing testing results from thousands of pieces of earned and social media content. It shows people that the most effective way of using Trump’s words and behavior is tying them to consequences in voters’ lives. That’s what Kamala Harris does every day by comparing her to-do list with his enemies list, for example.” Harris currently leads Trump by less than one percentage point, according to a Daily Wire average of 305 polls. At this point in 2020, President Joe Biden had a 4.5-point lead over Trump, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average at the time. Polymarket, the world’s largest prediction market, gives Trump a 66.6% chance of winning the election. Already have an account? Your information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Rogan Doesn’t Agree","Rogan said the podcast isn't meant to be so short Joe Rogan, the world’s biggest podcast host, revealed early Tuesday morning the numerous demands Vice President Kamala Harris’ team has made to appear on the “Joe Rogan Experience” (JRE) podcast. Rogan has said that he offered both Harris and her opponent, former President Donald Trump, an invitation to appear on his show. Trump agreed and sat down for a lengthy three-hour episode released last week. Posting on X, Rogan said Harris’ camp demanded that the host travel to her and that Harris only record for an hour. “For the record, the Harris campaign has not passed on doing the podcast. They offered a date for Tuesday, but I would have had to travel to her and they only wanted to do an hour,” Rogan posted. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin,” he followed up. “My sincere wish is to just have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being. I really hope we can make it happen.” Notably, JRE episodes are rarely shorter than two hours and often last three hours — the length of time Trump appeared on the podcast. Additionally, it’s unclear if Rogan has ever taped a show outside of his studio, something Harris’ team is also demanding.

Rogan responded with a message similar to his post on Tuesday, saying he could imagine Harris on his show and would not try to “interview her” but try to “get to know her as a human being.” The most hilarious moment of the night dropped when Trump candidly asked Rogan, “Can you imagine Kamala doing this show?” Rogan replied, “I could imagine her doing this show,” but Trump pushed back, insisting that if Kamala dared to engage in an unscripted three-hour… pic.twitter.com/Wk0Grmcqvx — The Vigilant Fox 🦊 (@VigilantFox) October 26, 2024 Related: Joe Rogan: Kamala Was ‘Supposed To’ Do My Show, Has Not Showed Up Already have an account?

Vice President Kamala Harris claimed over the weekend that the inflation crisis she sparked shortly after coming into office was not a “partisan issue.” Harris claimed in an interview with CBS News that she could lower prices of private sector goods and services by signing legislation. “What do you think you’ll be able to do if you have a divided Congress?” host Norah O’Donnell asked. “So I will tell you, for most of the issues that I think concern the vast majority of Americans, they’re not partisan issues,” Harris said while citing things like “bringing down the cost of groceries, [and] bringing down the cost of housing.” “These are not partisan issues,” she said. “Democrats, Republicans, independents deal with these issues equally, and actually don’t think of think of them through the lens of the party with which they’re registered to vote.

The bill — which not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted for — was signed into law a week later. The American Rescue Plan was the catalyst that sparked the country’s highest inflation rates in more than 40 years, with The Washington Post noting that prices on a wide range of items began to rise “within days” of the bill being signed into law. The following month, inflation jumped from 2.6% to 4.2%, the highest number in well over a decade, and a year later, inflation rates were soaring over 8% on a monthly basis, going as high as 9.1% in June 2022.

Vice President Kamala Harris got caught on a hot mic while chatting with campaign surrogate and Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) — and then tried to laugh it off after she appeared to admit that her team was struggling to reach male voters. Harris, who was catapulted to the top of the Democratic Party’s 2024 ticket after President Joe Biden was effectively forced out of the race, has continued to poll poorly among male voters despite a series of targeted efforts to mitigate that weakness.

The Donald Trump campaign is fuming over a “despicable and racist” attack ad from Kamala Harris, which targets Asian American voters with a warning that voting in Trump would bring back World War II-era internment camps. The ad, which targets Asian American voters specifically, appears to suggest that Trump would bring about an environment in which they could once again face internment like they did after the Empire of Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. It also predicts that Trump would spark a rise in racially-motivated crimes like the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin — a Chinese immigrant who was beaten to death by two white auto workers more than forty years ago. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung, the son of Chinese immigrants, told The Daily Wire that the ad shows the campaign has “no morals, decency, or ethical standards.” “This is despicable and racist behavior by Kamala Harris and her team,” Cheung said. “They have no morals, decency, or ethical standards, so they resort to the lowest form of political theater.” Things are getting out of hand. @KamalaHarris just dropped a new ad targeting Asian voters that suggests Trump will bring back internment camps, blames him for the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin pic.twitter.com/CYa3ZhdKfz — Brent Scher (@BrentScher) October 26, 2024 Cheung took aim at the Harris campaign official in charge of courting Asian American voters, Andrew Peng. “Andrew Peng is a f***ing disgrace to the AAPI community and he should be shamed for throwing his own people down the gutter for political purposes,” he continued. The ad flashes images of the internment camps and concludes with Harris’ endorsement of the content and the message — but critics, several of whom are Asian Americans themselves, were less than impressed with the Democratic nominee’s latest efforts to reach them. Virginia Republican Senate candidate Hung Cao, for example, is a Vietnamese immigrant whose family fled communist rule after the fall of Saigon. He said that behind all the bluster and fear-mongering that the Left has continued to stoke against Trump lurked a Democratic Party just waiting for enough power to turn the United States into the same hell from which families like his had escaped.

The following is an edited transcript of an interview between Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief John Bickley and Newsweek’s Deputy Opinion Editor Batya Ungar-Sargon on the state of the U.S. Presidential race on a special Saturday edition of Morning Wire. In the final run-up to election day, the two presidential candidates are sharpening their pitch to voters. Donald Trump remains focused on the economy and immigration, while Kamala Harris seems to be shifting back to the Democrat message of Trump being a “danger to democracy.” But whose vision for the country resonates with more Americans? In this episode we speak with Batya Ungar-Sargon, deputy opinion editor at Newsweek about the stark contrasts between Trump and Harris. * * * JOHN: Joining us to discuss the current state of the presidential race, including the gender and class divide, is Batya Ungar-Sargon, author of “Second Class: How the Elites Betrayed America’s Working Men and Women.” Batya, great to have you back on. BATYA: Thank you so much for having me. It’s always such a pleasure and an honor to be with you. JOHN: Well, we love hearing that and having you on. First, we’ve seen a new article from The Atlantic that the legacy media has given a lot of weight to. It levels some ugly claims against Trump about supposedly praising Hitler’s generals and disparaging a slain soldier – it’s based on unnamed sources. Everyone on the record, however, has said it’s nonsense. What are we to make of this story and how the legacy media are approaching it just days out from the election? BATYA: It’s amazing, right? We’re right back where we started, “Trump is Hitler.” They just can’t keep away from it. And when they first trotted Kamala Harris out in what was nothing short of a coup against President Biden, replacing him with her at the top of the ticket, I think they thought she was going to emerge as some sort of phoenix from the ashes of the Democratic Party – as if we had never met Kamala Harris before, as if we didn’t know who she was. They really acted like this was a person no one had ever met. I think they believed that she was going to invigorate the base so powerfully that they could retire the “Trump is Hitler; Trump is a fascist; Trump is a threat to democracy.” Now that they are seeing she is actually just the Kamala Harris that we all know from her forays into politics over the last two decades, they’ve fallen back on what they think is their winning argument, which is “Trump is Hitler,” — which they had sort of promised to do away with, I think, in the wake of the first assassination attempt on his life. It really does smack of desperation, the fact that these are all unnamed sources; the fact that the allegations are exactly the same. The Atlantic had an article a couple weeks ago arguing Trump is Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, right? They’re trying to up the ante. And, of course, it’s so depressing because what it does is cheapen the impact Hitler actually had in this world. It cheapens who these people were, Mussolini and Stalin, by comparing them to somebody who’s, at the end of the day, a patriot and somebody who just wants the best for his country. I think we’re really seeing, both on the Left and on the Right, an inability to comprehend why Hitler was that bad. That’s really what we’ve gotten to. It’s not just that it engenders attempts on Donald Trump’s life, but it also really cheapens the history that a lot of people really suffered through. Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty Images JOHN: Meanwhile, we have Trump on the campaign trail serving fries to Americans and looking like a very relatable, non-threatening man who’s having a great time on the campaign trail. A lot of times you can see who’s winning by who’s having the most fun, right? Look, we keep hearing about the gender gap – you mentioned the identity question: “Women for Harris, men for Trump.” And a lot of polling does show this to be true. What do you see as the motivations behind that? BATYA: It’s interesting, because what we’re really seeing here is the class divide mapping onto the gender divide. Harris is appealing to college educated women and Donald Trump is appealing to working class men. Of course, this has a lot to do with the aesthetics of the campaign. You mentioned Trump at McDonald’s and what I found so amazing about that moment was he showed up in his suit and did not take off his tie. He put the McDonald’s apron over the costume of Donald Trump. I think what that really showed was that he did not think this was a degraded job. He did not think that you had to sort of dress down and be humiliated to take this job. He acted the part of a McDonald’s worker with a lot of dignity. And I think that is why people really responded to that image of him. He looked proud to be doing it. He looked happy to be doing it. And I really cannot think of another politician who could have pulled that off in that way. He stands with workers and you see the way in which his economic policy is designed for the working class: No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on social security. He promised he would reduce the corporate taxes of any company that reshores manufacturing from 21% to 15%. This is going to encourage radical reshoring of manufacturing. He said he’s going to appoint a czar to entice American businesses back to the United States. Of course, women work in factories. Of course, women do service industry jobs. Of course, women work jobs that have overtime. But they are jobs that require physical brawn and physicality, the kinds of jobs that used to deliver the American dream before the Democrats became the party of the college educated. Meanwhile you look at the Harris campaign and she really is targeting that female college educated sector of the population — people who have less economic insecurity, less economic struggle. People who are very, very invested in the question of abortion, honestly, to an extent that does not represent where the vast majority of Americans are at, the middle and the working class, who have a much more moderate view on abortion. This idea that abortion should be legal in all cases is very correlated with whether or not you have a college degree, and of course, women today in America are 15 points more likely to have that college degree. So it really reflects the way the Democrats have created an economy that really rewards women in a very big way. Win McNamee/Getty Images JOHN: Now, we’ve seen millions of dollars from the Harris campaign funneled into abortion-focused advertising. Do you think that’s having a positive effect for her campaign? BATYA: I think the elites care more about cultural issues and the working class cares more about economic issues at this point. The elites have more money and more time and more commitment as a result of that privilege to showing up and voting. So it was a very smart thing for her to do. Even though Donald Trump has promised that he would veto a national abortion ban, the Democrats are a much more natural party for people who believe in late-term abortions because Democratic politicians are unwilling to say what the upper limit on the right to an abortion should be. They refuse to give that. So even though it is Republicans whose view at this point, namely Donald Trump, reflects more where the American people are at because of this question of the bans that she has been able to, I think, successfully tar Republicans with, she’s really been able to mobilize that elite, over-credentialed, educated female vote. JOHN: Now, you mentioned the economic policies of Trump. Harris has presented some of her own policy proposals. Can you walk us through the differences there? BATYA: Absolutely. About one month in, she came out with an economic agenda she’s been calling an “opportunity economy.” And she had three main promises. The first was a massive investment in small businesses by way of tax cuts. People have sort of poked holes in that and said, “Well, a tax cut for a new business is not really going to help those people because they’re not going to have a lot of revenue those first few years,” which means that a tax cut is not going to help them very much. The second plank, she promised a $25,000 tax cut for first time homeowners, as well as cutting a lot of regulation around housing. And I think that that was actually a very smart plan from the cutting deregulation point of view, because, of course, we need much more housing. The reason people are finding it so hard to buy a home is just a sheer lack of supply. The problem with giving a $25,000 tax cut to first time homeowners is that it will increase demand. So there’s a real problem there. The experts on housing have said this is actually only going to make the problem worse because when you’re doing that you’re actually making more people able to buy homes, which means that this dwindling stock is going to become even more expensive. And the third idea that she had was just cribbed right from JD Vance, and it was a $6,000 tax cut for children for the first year of a child’s life. Of course, JD has said $5,000 and I believe it is unlimited for parents. So it was very interesting to me because from one point of view, this is not a great plan. It does reflect the Democrats overall view of how to help people who are struggling, which is instead of creating an economy that pays better to working class people, you sort of raise taxes on the rich and then redistribute that, which, of course, working class people don’t want that. They don’t want somebody else’s tax cuts. They don’t want welfare. They want much more of what Trump is offering, which is a protectionist economy, an economy that looks at the economy as a whole and says, ”How can we protect the labor of workers?” And Trump, of course, does that through tariffs, through, getting rid of free trade and then of course, through limiting the supply of labor through immigration control. Alex Wong/Getty Images JOHN: Speaking of immigration, I wanted to ask you about that next. There’s a stark difference between these two candidates on this – and this issue converges with the economy instantly. We’ve seen this playing out in all kinds of very specific ways – including with the Haitian migrants in some of these small towns that’s been highlighted in the debates. How is Harris trying to counter the immigration message? Is she doing an effective job at all? BATYA: I think she’s sort of thrown up her hands on it, honestly. She was sort of caught between a rock and a hard place because she was second in command in the Biden administration, which has been an absolute disaster for immigration. Opening the border and effectively allowing in 10 million undocumented immigrants to compete with Americans at the bottom end of the wage spectrum. And what’s actually worse is when they finally, finally — after three and a half years — decided to take executive action, what they did was create legal pathways to parole a whole bunch of people. So you don’t have the mess at the border anymore. They have actually paroled hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people into the country to compete legally with American workers. And of course, that is why this is happening. The gains that working class Americans had been seeing throughout the Trump presidency, and then in the post pandemic labor crunch, were halted immediately. And there’s just been precipitous wage losses now — wage theft, to be honest, from working class people because of all of these paroled people. So the Haitians in Springfield are part of that group. They were paroled into the country by the Biden administration, I believe, because he thought that halting working class wage growth was the only way to tamp inflation down and to get that stigma off of his administration. So when Trump shows up and says, “They’re eating the cats, they’re eating the dogs, they’re eating the pets of the people in Springfield,” they’re probably not eating their cats and their dogs. They’re not doing anything to the pets. What they’re doing is they’re taking the jobs. And to me, personally, that’s much more outrageous than eating the pets. JOHN: A lot of folks would agree. Now, final question: Energy was a focus for Trump in 2016 when he won. It’s a focus again now. Can you lay out the contrasts between these two candidates when it comes to energy policies? BATYA: It’s interesting. That’s Trump’s answer when people ask him, “How are you going to get inflation down?” And he says, I think accurately, “Energy is one of the biggest drivers of inflation.” Because, of course, there’s energy at stake in everything to do with groceries, everything to do with food, whether it’s growing it, transporting it, feeding cattle — everything. The cost of energy is going to be a huge driver in the cost of everything else. Trump wants to “drill baby drill.” He wants to use every method available. He wants us to be energy independent, which of course is a huge, huge contributor to the sovereignty of our nation. Kamala Harris was, at one time, a very big Green New Deal extremist, but like immigration, she sort of tried very hard not to talk about this topic because even the voters in her party are no longer there. Everybody wants to get back to this sort of very moderate center. So she has not been able to express where she stands on this issue, like many other issues, because in order to win now, she has to pivot far, far away from commitments she’s made in the past. I think this is why they call Trump “Hitler” day in and day out, because it is Trump who has the moderate middle position on every issue. You look at where Trump is at, whether it’s abortion, whether it’s unions, whether it’s courting black voters, whether it’s energy, whether it’s immigration, even mass deportations – every one of these positions where Trump has eked himself out, that is where 50, 60, 70% of Americans are at, and that is the real threat to the Democratic Party. JOHN: Batya, great to have you on again. BATYA: Thank you so much. JOHN: That was Batya Ungar-Sargon, author of “Second Class” – and this has been a Saturday edition of Morning Wire. *** Continue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+ Already a member?

Neither President Joe Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris were in Washington, D.C., as Israel launched military strikes against Iran on Friday night. The absence of America’s highest elected leaders comes after U.S. officials were given at least six hours of advance notice about Israel’s airstrikes against the Islamic regime’s military facilities. Harris was in Houston, Texas, for a political rally with Beyoncé on Friday night as there are less than two weeks left in the 2024 presidential race. Biden returned home to Wilmington, Delaware, on Friday night. “Biden on his way in Delaware and Harris on stage with Beyoncé,” said Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL). “Even though the U.S. was apparently informed the Israel strikes on Iran would begin tonight?” “Who is in the White House?” he asked. Iran tried to downplay the strikes, claiming that many of the explosions that were heard around the country came from Iran intercepting Israeli fighter jets. “This is a lie,” an Israeli official said. “There have been no intercepts.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 The fact that Iran was trying to downplay the attacks was a likely indicator that they were not wanting to respond with a counterattack because that would invite an even harsher Israeli response. “If we hear Iranian officials downplaying the success of Israel’s strikes, it could be a signal that they are looking for an excuse to avoid further retaliation,” said Michael Singh, a former senior director for the Middle East at the U.S. National Security Council. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) targeted Iranian military bases around the country’s capital city of Tehran during the early morning hours on Saturday, according to the IDF and Iranian media. Israel had said in a statement that it was “conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran.” Fars news agency, which is linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), confirmed the news, claiming that several military bases in the west and southwest of Tehran were targeted in the airstrikes. The airstrikes appear to have hit multiple locations throughout Tehran, including the eastern, western, and southern parts of the city, according to The New York Times. In the east, there are military bases and secretive military sites, and in the west is the headquarters for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the report said. The Times added that explosions also were happening near Imam Khomeini international airport, which is in the southern part of the city. The Times said residents also reported hearing explosions in Isfahan, hundreds of miles south of Tehran; Mashhad, hundreds of miles east of Tehran; and Kurdistan Province, a couple hundred miles west of Tehran. An Israeli official said that they were not targeting Iranian oil or nuclear facilities. “We’re targeting things that might have threatened us in the past or could do in the future,” the official said. The strikes come in response to the Islamic regime firing approximately 180 ballistic missiles into Israel at the start of the month, which sent the entire country running for bomb shelters.

Well, America — or whoever the hell I’m talking to — the day of decision is rapidly drawing near, so it’s time we set partisanship aside and took a clear-eyed, objective look at our choices. Are we going to give our vote to an orange-colored demagogue whose reckless rhetoric reveals a tyrannical disregard for American freedoms? Or will we go with Donald Trump? (And okay, that question might have confused you because of the reference to being orange. But — I mean, look at her!) The important thing is: as the purely surly hurly-burly whirly-swirly of election day draws near, it’s much too easy to sink into closed-minded bias like an explorer sinking into quicksand until there’s nothing left on the surface but a pith helmet and a half-finished hand-drawn map of some obscure Nile tributary rumored to have its source in a fountain of eternal youth where shapely native girls lie naked on the shore just waiting for a virile white man they would gladly service with their ancient arts of pleasure if those pale-faced morons didn’t keep drowning in quicksand as if it were the closed-minded bias that it’s much too easy to sink into as the purely surly hurly-burly of election day draws near. But we mustn’t get carried away by our emotions or our endlessly elaborate and essentially meaningless quicksand metaphors, and should instead try to ensure that our final decision results from making a careful examination of policies and character until we develop a wholly dispassionate and unprejudiced overview of just how badly Kamala Harris sucks. So we should be open to searching out some of the positive things about Kamala. Like… we’re not married to her. We don’t have to listen to that laugh day after day until we start having dreams that we’re locked in a closet with the Joker from the Saturday morning Batman cartoons and then wake up with our hands around her throat for the third time that week and begin to understand that our subconscious is trying to tell us something. Also, in a Kamala Harris administration, America could return to the days when a man who was willing to work hard could finally make enough money to pay off the college debts of some harridan who majored in feminist rage and now spends her time making TikTok videos denouncing the patriarchy from the front seat of the car she bought with the money from the man who was willing to work hard like a schmuck. And as for Donald Trump, yes, he’d probably bring down prices and avoid World War III, but think of all the terrible things he’s said in all those news media reports of terrible things he never said. Do you want to spend four more years raging at things the news media says he said that he never said when you could be kicking back without a care in the world enjoying all the benefits of inflation and World War III? Then there’s the fact that Kamala Harris is going to make sure that billionaires pay their fair share of the money she’s going to give you for voting for her. Donald Trump, meanwhile, plans to dynamite the deep state until all that’s left is flaming rubble and a collection of screaming bureaucrats scattering in every direction like panicked ants trying to escape a spray can of Raid. Sure, that would be hilarious, but without bureaucrats, where could we turn when we wanted to be bullied by idiots? And now the news media has shocked us all by comparing Donald Trump to Hitler like they always do. And yes, they’re lying, but that’s no reason not to believe them. If you’re going to stop believing the news media just because they lie, you’d have to walk around not believing them all the time, and it would be as if David Muir was just sitting there with his mouth moving and no sound coming out. And okay, that would be great. But that’s no reason to vote for Trump. Or at least it’s only one reason. So America, put your prejudices aside and choose wisely. Because while these are two candidates who are both orange in their own way, only one of them has worked for McDonald’s while Kamala Harris sucks. * * * This excerpt is taken from the opening satirical monologue of “The Andrew Klavan Show.” Andrew Klavan is the host of “The Andrew Klavan Show” at The Daily Wire.

During a CNN panel about Harris’ dismal performance in the CNN Town Hall, O’Leary brought up how the party in 2016 picked then-Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton over presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who appeared to have more energy and support from their base. “Only 90 days ago, Pelosi went to Biden and said, ‘You need to step aside,’ and convinced him to do so,” O’Leary said. “He did actually ask her, we’ve now learned this, ‘Is she[ Harris] the right person to drive this home?’” “He questioned that,” he added. “He could’ve said, ‘We need to run a process in order for me to make this move,’ but they decided not to.

And as long as they meet the legal deadline, in the states where they are on the ballot, they can do it.” Phillip said that the party can “decide in December of 2023 to just handpick someone.

A federal judge sided with the Biden-Harris administration on Friday in ruling that Virginia must put non-citizen immigrants back on its voter rolls after they were removed by the state in compliance with state law. U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles, who was appointed by the Biden-Harris administration, ordered that Virginia must put the non-citizens back on the voter rolls, even though it is illegal for them to vote. “Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals–who self-identified themselves as noncitizens–back onto the voter rolls,” said Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. “Almost all these individuals had previously presented immigration documents confirming their noncitizen status, a fact recently verified by federal authorities.” Youngkin noted that the law, passed in 2006, was signed by then-Governor Tim Kaine, a Democrat. The law “mandates certain procedures to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls, with safeguards in place to affirm citizenship before removal–and the ultimate failsafe of same-day registration for U.S. citizens to cast a provisional ballot,” Youngkin said. “This law has been applied in every Presidential election by Republicans and Democrats since enacted 18 years ago.” Youngkin said that the state would immediately file a petition with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court, for an emergency stay of the injunction. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called Giles’ ruling “a totally unacceptable travesty” and announced that he would now host a rally in the state before Election Day. “Sleepy Joe Biden and Comrade Kamala Harris ridiculously accuse me of wanting to ‘weaponize’ the Justice Department, when they have done all of the weaponizing,” Trump wrote. “Now, their truly Weaponized Department of ‘Injustice,’ and a Judge (appointed by Joe), have ORDERED the Great Commonwealth of Virginia to PUT NON-CITIZEN VOTERS BACK ON THE ROLLS.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 “This is a totally unacceptable travesty, and Governor Youngkin is absolutely right to appeal this ILLEGAL ORDER, and the U.S. Supreme Court will hopefully fix it!” he added. “Only U.S. Citizens should be allowed to vote.

"68","https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-lefts-betrayal-of-the-first-amendment","The Left’s Betrayal Of The First Amendment","According to the MRC study, each of these six candidates previously stood for free speech rights. Today’s Democrats, led by Kamala Harris, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, are not just tiptoeing around the edges of censorship; they’re creating an Orwellian nightmare where the state is being called upon to regulate speech and to determine what is fit to be heard in the public square. The Media Research Center took a stroll down memory lane to measure the seismic shift in attitudes toward the First Amendment for Harris and the other Democratic nominees of the 21st century, including Biden, Hillary Clinton, Obama, John Kerry and Al Gore. According to the MRC study, each of these six candidates previously stood for free speech rights. Now, they claim that constitutionally protected speech is a threat to democracy. Their tortuous logic is inexplicable, but their previous quotes have not yet been whitewashed by the Left’s ever-faithful tech behemoth, Google. In 2006, Gore scolded the Bush administration for allegedly trying to “silence dissenting views” by censoring information “inconsistent with its stated ideological goals.” Fast forward to 2023, and Gore suggests social media algorithms should be “banned,” calling them the “digital equivalent of AR-15s.” In 2011, Clinton vowed to protect free speech “with the force of law.” But just last month, she said that Americans should be “criminally charged” for spreading what she dubbed “propaganda.” She later warned, “[i]f they don’t moderate and monitor the content, we lose total control.” In 2015, Obama affirmed that government propaganda “runs contrary to everything we believe.” Yet, in 2022, Obama called on Americans to “pick a side” regarding whether social media companies should be forced to censor Americans. In 2015, Kerry rebuked censorship, affirming that “freedom must win out over censorship.” A year earlier, he condemned the very acts committed by his own party today: “Imagine if I couldn’t talk to you today simply because my government had shut down or censored the internet.” But now Kerry unashamedly attacks the First Amendment “as a major block.” In 2017, Biden passionately defended free speech rights for all: “[W]e hurt ourselves badly when we don’t allow the speech to take place. … The First Amendment is one of the defining features of who we are in the Bill of Rights. And to shut it down in the name of what is appropriate is simply wrong.” In that same year, Harris similarly tweeted, “The free and open internet is a cornerstone of our society and must be protected at all costs.” But like their predecessors, Biden and Harris have flip-flopped, deciding instead that the best way to combat ideas they dislike is not through debate, but through deletion. In the guise of combatting mis- and dis-information, they created the largest censorship regime in U.S. history, spanning 10 federal departments and six additional regulatory agencies. For example, the State and Homeland Security Departments have partnered repeatedly to censor conservatives in the media. The Pentagon has also used our tax dollars to bludgeon advertisers, cajoling them not to work with conservative media outlets. Independent agencies are at it, too. The Federal Communications Commission is punishing free-speech advocate Elon Musk while rewarding anti-free speech zealot George Soros. And the National Science Foundation is competing with the Energy Department to be the wizard behind the censorship curtain. This isn’t about mis-information; it’s about power. Democratic leaders have traded the mantle of freedom for the chains of control, embracing the tech titans as partners and enforcers of their narrative. Once heralded as the new public square, social media platforms have become a digital dungeon where speech is policed not by law, but by algorithm. While elites in the Democratic Party play the role of speech censors, conservatives have joined with traditional Democrats in a coalition to protect speech rights. This coalition is led mostly by former Democrats, including Donald Trump, Elon Musk and two former presidential candidates, Robert F. Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard. Trump’s running mate JD Vance articulated the correct perspective on speech in the vice presidential debate: “I believe we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately, it’s not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about: It is the threat of censorship.” Vance is sounding a wake-up call that resonates like the siren many of us heard as school children during nuclear-war fallout drills. We’re not just at risk of losing an argument; we’re at risk of losing America. The next president of the United States will take the oath of office, swearing to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” The media must do their job and ask each of the candidates whether they can take this oath, without snickering and crossing fingers. * * * L.

Vice President Kamala Harris hired a communications staffer this summer who boasts that he performs as a drag queen on the weekends. Eric Lipka, the Harris campaign’s Pennsylvania deputy press secretary, has gone by the drag queen names “Erotica the Drag Queen,” “Erotica,” and “Erica Lipka,” on social media, Fox News Digital reported, and his name has been featured in dozens of public Facebook posts. He danced and performed drag at a “Saint Saturday” event in Richmond, Virginia in January 2024, according to Fox, and in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware as well as various locations in Maryland, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C. His social media profiles formerly said that he was a “woman from the neck up” and described him as “DC’s twirling twunk” — a term defined by Urban Dictionary as one “used amongst the LGBTQ community to describe males (typically gay) with the face of a twink (boyish-looking, pretty) but the body of a hunk (muscular, jocky).” Thrilled to share I’ve joined the Biden-Harris campaign as deputy press secretary for Pennsylvania! Let’s get to work, and finish the job! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/xWoh7ZsPGY — Eric Lipka (@ericclipkaa) July 17, 2024 Harris is currently on thin ice with Catholic voters in Pennsylvania, particularly due to her campaign’s stances on unrestricted abortions. The Pennsylvania Catholic Conference estimated in 2020 that 24% of the state’s population is Catholic, almost 3 million residents. Lipka’s “X” account biography specifically states that he is a “drag queen” “on weekends.” Fox News reported in July that Lipka’s social media accounts were “locked down” shortly after the publication reached out to the then-Biden campaign for comment. But a few of his drag posts remain on his “X” account, such as a September 2023 post in which he tweeted: “To celebrate it being Friday, some drag content to bless your feed.” Screenshot, Twitter. “But [for real] I had really ate that uppp,” the Harris staffer added. His post includes two videos of an individual, apparently Lipka, dressed in aggressive makeup, jewelry, and women’s clothing. In the second video, an individual dressed in drag struts across a stage in a “custom made, dominatrix inspired” outfit, as a person in the background describes. An apparent friend of Lipka’s tagged him in a Facebook post on October 2o22 with the caption: “The girls that drag together, bottoms down together.” “Babyyyyy u already know,” responded Lipka. Neither Lipka nor the Harris campaign responded to requests for comment for this story. In July, President Joe Biden’s campaign defended him to Fox News Digital, telling the publication that it is “proud” to have Lipka on the campaign. “We’re proud to have a team of 200 talented Pennsylvania staffers, including Eric, highlighting Trump’s record killing 275,000 jobs across the commonwealth and his discriminatory and extreme Project 2025 agenda to make life worse for our families,” Jack Doyle, the Pennsylvania communications director for the Biden campaign, told Fox News Digital. Prior to his employment on the Harris campaign, Lipka worked as a press assistant for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and as a communications intern for Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA). In an apparently deleted LinkedIn post that Fox cited in July, Lipka wrote that he brought “perspective as a gay latino” to Garcia’s office, describing how he helped build Garcia’s brand” and “name ID” by connecting him with one of the winner’s of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” arranging a “meet-and-greet at a DC LGBTQ+ venue.” “We then pushed this to our LGBTQ+ lists, which went viral in that community,” Lipka wrote, according to Fox.

Former President Donald Trump again called for Vice President Kamala Harris to have a cognitive test after her combative interview with Fox News host Bret Baier on Wednesday. In reaction to the interview, Trump criticized Harris for pivoting to attack him when asked about her policy positions. Baier’s interview with Harris lasted nearly 30 minutes as he pressed her on issues from the border crisis to what she would do differently from President Joe Biden. Trump praised Baier and criticized Harris’s record on illegal immigration on Truth Social after the pre-taped interview aired. “Great job by Bret Baier in his Interview with Lyin’ Kamala Harris. She has a massive and irredeemable case of TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME – So bad, in fact, that she is barely able to talk about any subject other than the man who had the best economy ever, the strongest border in history, and who just got the UNANIMOUS ENDORSEMENT OF THE U.S. Border Patrol, ME! Their Endorsement was a TREMENDOUS HONOR!!! They said that Comrade Kamala did a terrible job, the absolute worst in memory, and can’t be allowed to do it again,” he posted. In the same post, he called for Harris to have a cognitive test, echoing a call on Sunday when he said Harris had “slow and lethargic” answers during interviews. “She is also the WORST Vice President in history, but hopefully will soon be GONE,” Trump said Wednesday. “Again, congratulations to Bret Baier on a tough but very fair interview, one that clearly showed how totally incompetent Kamala is. For the good of our Nation, her inferior Cognitive ability must be tested at once!” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Baier asked Harris about her campaign slogan: “It’s time to turn the page.” “So what are you turning the page from?” he asked, noting that the Biden-Harris administration has been in charge for more than three years. “Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other, rhetoric and an approach to leadership that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know. The strength of leadership is based on who you lift up,” Harris replied. Harris was also pressed on the record number of illegal immigrants who entered the United States under the Biden-Harris administration’s watch, her handling of Biden’s apparent cognitive decline, and her economic proposals.

Daily Wire editor emeritus Ben Shapiro reviewed Vice President Kamala Harris’ interview on Fox News after it aired on Wednesday evening, calling it a “full-scale disaster area” for her campaign for president. Harris sat for an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier on Wednesday. The roughly 25-minute sit-down was arguably her toughest interview yet in a campaign that has been light on opportunities for direct media scrutiny. “Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. I thought it was not going to be great. I did not think it was going to be that not great,” Shapiro said. “So listen, Kamala Harris has been avoiding difficult interviews this entire election cycle. The most difficult interview she did was with Bill Whitaker, and ‘60 Minutes’ chopped it up to make her look better. That did not happen with Bret Baier and it was a full-scale disaster area for her,” he continued. The Daily Wire host then went through some of Harris’ worst moments, beginning with the first issue of the interview: immigration. Baier questioned Harris on the Biden administration’s decision to repeal dozens of executive orders on border policy implemented under the previous Trump administration and the impact that decision had on the unprecedented wave of illegal immigration that has taken place in the past four years. “She immediately swiveled. She will not answer the question,” Shapiro said. “She won’t just say, listen, we blew it at the beginning. We reversed Donald Trump’s executive orders. We got it right now. We understand the problem. … But she can’t do that because she also wants to say that she owns it, that she was involved in every decision.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Harris struggled to field questions on her pitch to “turn the page” on her term as vice president, rationalize why nearly 80% of Americans believe the country is on the “wrong track,” her past support of taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for illegal immigrants and inmates, her defense of President Joe Biden’s mental acuity, and other topics. Throughout the interview, she overwhelmingly preferred to redirect to former president Donald Trump than to answer questions about her record in the Biden administration. “Man, she looked bad,” Shapiro said. “She looked absolutely awful. She looked contentious. She looked angry at Bret Baier for having the temerity to ask her any sort of serious question. She’s got to be super ticked at her team for suggesting that she do Bret Baier in the first place. She’s unwilling or unable to answer any question about policy at all in this election cycle.” “The only thing she’s got at all in this election cycle, the only thing she’s got and everybody knows it is” talking about Trump, he continued. “But here is the problem: the minute you dig below the surface, what you realize is that she is an empty vessel for the entire Biden administration agenda. And she’s not particularly smart. She doesn’t know her own policies well enough to make cogent and interesting distinctions about how her policies work. She doesn’t understand how to defend the policies that she has herself put into place.” My instant reaction to Kamala Harris' interview with Bret Baier. Let's just say it didn't go well.

Harris fumed. Vice President Kamala Harris exploded during an interview Wednesday night when confronted with her cover-up of President Joe Biden’s serious cognitive decline. Harris made the remarks to Bret Baier during her first real interview of the election cycle in which she was asked difficult questions and repeated follow-ups. “You told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, that [he] ran around circles on his staff,” Baier noted. “When did you first notice that President Biden’s mental faculties appeared diminished?” Baier’s question came after Biden was forced out of the presidential race by the Democrat Party following his disastrous debate performance against former President Donald Trump. Harris flashed a deer-in-the-headlights look when asked the question, and paused for a moment before answering. “Joe Biden, I have watched in — from the Oval Office to the Situation Room, and he has the judgment and the experiment — and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people,” Harris claimed. Baier pushed back: “There were no concerns raised?” Harris snapped back: “Bret, Joe Biden is not on the ballot.” As Baier tried to talk, Harris repeatedly talked over him, saying: “And Donald Trump is.” Baier mentioned that notable figures said that Biden’s decline was blatantly obvious to everyone around him. “Actor George Clooney said within a few minutes of talking to President Biden at a fundraiser that he thought this was not the same Joe Biden,” Baier said. Harris responded: “Donald Trump is on the ballot.” WATCH: BRETT BAIER: “When did you first notice that Joe Biden’s mental faculties appeared diminished?” KAMALA: “Joe Biden is not on the ballot.” pic.twitter.com/rKK7dfgwBz — Conservative War Machine (@WarMachineRR) October 16, 2024 Already have an account?

"73","https://www.dailywire.com/news/harris-should-be-impeached","Harris Should Be Impeached","The pressure being put on Israel to not retaliate against Iran is being driven by electoral concerns. Kamala Harris should be impeached. There are a bunch of reasons she could theoretically be impeached. For example, the fact that she has not yet invoked the 25th Amendment to get rid of her boss after defenestrating him from his nomination would be a pretty good-sized abdication of her constitutional duty. The Constitution suggests that the vice president is chiefly responsible for getting rid of the president if the president is no longer compos mentis — if his brain no longer functions. That has been the case for Joe Biden for a long while. So clearly has that been the case, that Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party pushed him off the back of a train to get him out of the nomination. But they left him in office, which means she has abdicated her duty. But there’s something more specific that I want to look at today. I want to go all the way back in the time machine to 2019. You remember that Donald Trump was impeached twice. The first time he was actually not impeached over January 6, he was impeached over Ukraine. Trump held a phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky in which he allegedly threatened Zelensky with the withdrawal of American military aid if Zelensky did not cause prosecutors in Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden’s relationship with Burisma, a natural gas company in Ukraine where Hunter Biden served on the board. This was considered an impeachable offense. The basic idea for those who voted in favor of impeachment is that the president of the United States could not use foreign policy as a way of manufacturing election-related topics. You could not try to swivel an American election based on withholding aid from an American ally. In fact, here is how the impeachment charges against Trump ran in 2019. As you may recall, he was, in fact, impeached in the House and then, of course, he was acquitted in the Senate. So, in 2019, here is how those Trump impeachment charges ran: Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponent, and influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations. Just to get it straight, the charge brought against Trump in 2019 was that Donald Trump had made the government of Ukraine do something beneficial to his reelection effort, and in order to do that he had threatened to withdraw their aid. Now, fast forward to 2024. Israel is currently engaged in a war in the Gaza Strip. That war is with Hamas, a terror group that, as you will recall, a little more than a year ago, on October 7, 2023, invaded Israel, killed 1,200 people, and took 250 hostages back into the terror tunnels in the Gaza Strip. Ever since then, the Biden administration has been reticent to simply push for an Israeli victory. The Biden administration’s foreign policy on its own terms makes no sense. Their foreign policy in Ukraine — where Ukraine is currently fighting a defensive war, where they are not going to achieve total victory, they’re not going to take back the Donbas region, and they’re not going to take back Crimea. Their foreign policy has been a total victory for Ukraine. Whatever Zelensky wants, he gets. Then, when it comes to Israel — which does have dominant military power in the region — they demand Israel de-escalate the situation, and de-escalation needs to start right now. Imagine for a second the Biden administration reversing those positions. What if, when it came to Ukraine, they said, “We are willing to provide the amount of aid necessary in order for you to protect our borders and we’re going to push for an off-ramp.” And when it came to Israel, they said, “You get what you need in order to destroy your enemies and we will stand back and watch with glee as you take out Hamas, Hezbollah, and all the Iranian proxy groups.” That would make this a very different world right now. That foreign policy makes some sort of sense. In fact, that is something that the Biden administration should be doing right now. I recently had a conversation with the father of Edan Alexander, an American hostage taken on October 7 and being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. He, quite rightly, suggested that if the Biden administration had a spine or any brains at all, they would be saying to Iran, “We will let Israel completely off the chain to destroy your nuclear facilities unless you get Hamas to release the hostages.” And tomorrow the hostages would be out. He’s totally right about that, by the way. Instead, here is what is going on — and here’s where the impeachable offense comes in. Right now, the Biden administration is putting open pressure on the State of Israel to let in aid to the Gaza Strip. Now, do I think this is really about aid for the Gaza Strip? I do not. Why? Because it is well known that Hamas is stealing about 50% of all aid now going into the Gaza Strip. According to the New York Post: Hamas terrorists were captured on video taking control of 47 of 100 aid trucks entering the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. “It’s no secret that Hamas takes control of humanitarian aid. We’ve already published here tapes of Hamas, in which you hear them say themselves they have no more room in their warehouses,” Channel 12‘s Almog Boker reported on Wednesday evening. “But this evening we also bring special documentation of what it looks like from inside, with cameras that are tracking it in real time,” he said. Where is the aid supposed to be dropped off? Well, it’s supposed to be dropped with members of the UNRWA, which is a Hamas front group. So yesterday, the Biden administration warned Israel that they would withdraw military aid if Israel did not facilitate large-scale entry of humanitarian aid into the northern Gaza Strip. According to The Wall Street Journal: In a letter to senior Israeli officials, dated Oct. 13 and signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the U.S. blamed Israel for a drastic drop in humanitarian aid into Gaza that contributed to starvation and widespread suffering, particularly in the enclave’s north where Israel launched a renewed ground operation nearly two weeks ago. The top American officials gave Israel 30 days to “reverse the downward humanitarian trajectory” or else it “may have implications” for future weapons transfers and funding under U.S. law. Blinken and Austin specifically cite a part of Foreign Assistance Act that bars the U.S. from providing security aid to any nation that “prohibits or otherwise restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance.” “We have seen Israel make changes before, and when they make changes, humanitarian assistance can increase,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday after the letter’s release. Now, here is the reason I’m skeptical that the threat to withdraw aid is about the humanitarian assistance in the northern Gaza Strip. Reason number one: Israel has been shipping enormous sums of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip for months. At this point, we are talking about basically 2,500 calories per person, per day in the Gaza Strip for months on end — into an area where the civilians are still largely aligned with Hamas and where Israeli hostages are still being held captive, including multiple Americans. So, do I think this is about humanitarian assistance? No, I do not. I actually think they’re looking for a legal excuse to embargo Israel in order to threaten them not to do anything too big with Iran. Why? Here’s where the other half of the story comes in. The Washington Post recently reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated Israel will strike Iranian military, not nuclear or oil targets. Buried in this Washington Post article, however, is a bit of a revelation. According to The Washington Post: The White House had no immediate comment. The Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement that “we listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interest.” However, as the Post continues: The retaliatory action would be calibrated to avoid the perception of “political interference in the U.S. elections,” the official familiar with the matter said, signaling Netanyahu’s understanding that the scope of the Israeli strike has the potential to reshape the presidential race. Let’s be very clear about what is happening right now. That admission, that this is about the U.S. presidential race, that there is pressure being put on the Israeli government not to retaliate against Iran — that pressure is being driven by electoral concerns along with the threat to withdraw military aid from Israel in order to get Israel to do less with Iran in advance of the election. Do you know what that looks like? That looks an awful lot like foreign political interference during an election year. That looks an awful lot like what Democrats impeached Donald Trump for in 2019. When you put those two pieces of the puzzle together, that’s what it looks like. Number one, the United States openly threatening withdrawal of military aid to Israel, supposedly based on humanitarian assistance concerns, which is clearly not the case. Number two, the story that says Israel is going to hold back the full brunt of an attack on the Iranian nuclear facilities in order to facilitate the election efforts of Kamala Harris. That is the 2019 impeachment case in a nutshell. Remember, Kamala Harris has been on every phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu for weeks. She’s in the room. There are pictures of her in the room. So, she and her campaign are saying to Netanyahu, “Don’t go too hard on Iran.” Simultaneously, the secretary of state is saying, “And by the way, you should just know your military aid might get put on hold.” That sounds an awful lot like the 2019 impeachment charge against Donald Trump. But I guess it’s fine, so long as it’s a Democrat. Which is, of course, the case. The media apparently have no interest in whether or not foreign aid provisions are being violated, so long as we’re not talking about Ukraine and Donald Trump.

The plan Vice President Kamala Harris revealed this week for black men is actually not tailored just to them, her 2024 campaign has quietly admitted. As reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Harris’ team said the programs in the “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men” are not bound by race. Harris unveiled the plan to much fanfare on Monday amid concerns that black men were increasingly favoring her rival, former President Donald Trump. Its agenda includes, among other things, providing “1 million loans that are fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business.” But what is now evident with the clarification, as observed by The Wall Street Journal in its report, is the phrase “and others” is “doing a ton of work.” The paper noted Harris, as a lawyer and ex-state attorney general, “knows” the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has “little patience for racial preferences.” It also quoted a campaign aide who insisted that Harris is “clear-eyed” about the struggles of black men to get good-paying jobs and support loved ones. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 This unnamed aide also said Harris “is championing solutions that will benefit all Americans and address these specific barriers to economic opportunity.” Critics of Harris mocked the vice president for the duality after The Wall Street Journal revealed that her plan for black men is not actually just for them. “The Harris-Walz campaign is a total disaster!” exclaimed the popular Libs of TikTok account run by Chaya Raichik on the X social media platform. The Kamala campaign is now being forced to walk back and clarify her own policy. They claim her “Agenda for Black Men” will actually be for everyone on a “race-neutral basis.” The Harris-Walz campaign is a total disaster! pic.twitter.com/j8L5FVR6pa — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) October 16, 2024 In a separate post to X responding to the report, the “Trump War Room” account declared, “This is not what a serious presidential campaign looks like.” This summer, an NAACP poll showed one in four black men backing Trump for president, a sign that Democrats may be losing ground among that group. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), one of the most prominent black Democrats in Congress, expressed some agitation over the weekend in regard to the election. “Yes, I am concerned about the black men staying home or voting for Trump,” Clyburn said during an interview Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” The “Opportunity Agenda” also has sections on education, training, mentorship, cryptocurrency and other digital assets, health, and legalizing marijuana.

"75","https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamalas-pathetic-plan-to-bribe-black-voters-with-reparations-and-marijuana","Kamala’s Pathetic Plan To Bribe Black Voters With Reparations And Marijuana","Kamala Harris' campaign is now so underwater among black voters that they're straight-up offering to hand them cash. There have been a lot of moments in American politics when candidates realize they’re trailing badly in the polls, so they do something extreme in an effort to win some support. It usually doesn’t work out too well. Think of the “Dean Scream” back in 2004, which was supposed to rally the base after a tough loss in the Iowa caucuses. It ended up being played about 600 times on cable news until Dean dropped out of the race. Or if you want to go back further, think of George McGovern’s plan to shake up the race in 1972 by picking a totally unvetted running mate. That was exciting right up until it emerged that his running mate had received electro-shock therapy several times to treat his chronic mental illness. McGovern ended up losing 49 states. As we enter the homestretch of the 2024 presidential election, it’s clear that the Kamala Harris campaign now finds itself in a similar desperation mode. They’re trailing badly in pretty much every important poll and prediction market that matters. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz admit that they’re now the “underdogs” in the race. And so, inevitably, they’re feeling the pressure to do something unthinkable in a desperate attempt to win back votes. They have to throw out the playbook and try a new strategy. In recent days, we’ve learned what this last-minute Hail Mary looks like. It means that Harris will actually go out in public and speak without a script. This clearly wasn’t the plan when she first entered the race. For the first month of her candidacy, Kamala Harris was completely shut off from the media. It was one of the most surreal periods in modern presidential politics. We had a presidential nominee who wouldn’t talk to any journalists at all — even journalists who are friendly to her campaign. But now Harris has no choice. She’s facing a blowout loss. So, now she has an interview with Fox News planned for tonight. She’s also participating in “radio town halls” with hosts like “Charlamagne Tha God.” Unfortunately for Harris, already, this strategy isn’t going well. Like so many other Hail Mary’s in presidential politics, it’s backfiring. And it’s backfiring because every single time Harris opens her mouth, it becomes very clear why her campaign was hiding her away for so long. Let’s start with one of the questions asked on “Charlamagne tha God’s” show, because the question raises a bunch of its own issues. It concerns taxpayer-funded reparations for black people. Watch: Vice President Kamala Harris says she's open to using taxpayer's money to pay racial reparations: ""It has to be studied, there's no question about that."" She adds: ""In terms of my immediate plan … as it relates to the economy … I grew up in the middle class"" pic.twitter.com/HPjdHSgB29 — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 15, 2024 The first thing he says is, “We all know that America became great on the backs of free black labor.” So, I guess we’re pretending that slaves didn’t cost anything, for starters. That’s being conflated here with the idea that “black people weren’t paid.” That might seem like an irrelevant distinction but actually, it matters quite a bit in relation to the argument he’s making. As a factual matter, slavery involved massive investments that ultimately slowed the progress of this country dramatically. It turned out to be a much worse investment than the alternative. A professor at Brown University named David Meyer has said that, in the South prior to the Civil War, “investments were heavily concentrated in slaves,” relative to the North. And that led to the South’s failure to, “to build a deep and broad industrial infrastructure.” That includes services like railroads and schools. Once slavery was abolished, that infrastructure is what led to this country’s success in the generations following the Civil War. We became the top economy in the entire world once we jettisoned slavery. What didn’t lead to this country’s success — before or during the civil war — was slavery. The majority of slaves were involved in growing or picking cotton. But as the Foundation for Economic Education has reported, cotton didn’t account for a big portion of the overall U.S. economy. Economic historians, “have observed that although cotton exports comprised a tremendous share of total exports prior to the Civil War, they accounted for only around 5 percent of the nation’s overall gross domestic product, an important contribution but not the backbone of American economic development.” So, if you’re saying that slavery was instrumental to this country’s success, you’re vastly overstating the case. And it’s an argument that applies to many other countries far more credibly than it applies to ours. Africa was the last continent to officially abolish slavery, and that didn’t happen until the 1980s. So, why exactly is this America’s burden to bear? Why are we uniquely responsible for slavery? And why would we want to stoke the kind of generational race hatred that’s led to the murders of white farmers in places like South Africa? And for that matter, when is Kamala Harris going to pay her reparations? The Washington Free Beacon has reported that Harris was the “descendant of an Irishman who owned a slave plantation in Jamaica.” So, why hasn’t she pulled a Robin DiAngelo and opened her purse to offer black Americans some of her own money? She hasn’t even handed over a single dollar as far as I can tell, much less 20 dollars. It’s an outrage. But it’s not one that Harris has ever addressed. Maybe she’ll explain her reasoning in my next movie. Instead, in this “radio town hall,” Harris predictably chose to focus on the “systemic” ideal of reparations. And here’s her plan in that regard: Vice President Kamala Harris says she's open to using taxpayer's money to pay racial reparations: ""It has to be studied, there's no question about that."" She adds: ""In terms of my immediate plan … as it relates to the economy … I grew up in the middle class"" pic.twitter.com/HPjdHSgB29 — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 15, 2024 She starts rambling again about growing up in a middle-class family or whatever, even though she didn’t actually grow up in a middle-class family, and even though (as always) it’s completely irrelevant to what she’s talking about. But already — just from this short, 30-second answer — it’s clear that Harris herself doesn’t even know what she’s saying. In response to that question about reparations, here’s what she just said: “It has to be studied. I’ve been very clear about that position.” But she hasn’t been “very clear” about that position. In fact you can find multiple clips of Harris stating that she supports reparations. She doesn’t support a “study” of reparations, she actually thinks they should be paid out, in some form. Watch: Kamala says she’s in favor of reparations because America is racist and there are inequities including Black people not being able to vote pic.twitter.com/DFlafInsJd — Libs of TikTok (@libsoftiktok) September 2, 2024 ""There have to be some form of reparations"" – Kamala Harris pic.twitter.com/xkhMKWEu0z — Wall Street Silver (@WallStreetSilv) July 30, 2024 So, this is, once again, a complete retreat from what Kamala Harris previously claimed to believe. We can add it to the list of policies that she supported back in California, but disavows now. That’s a list that includes decriminalizing illegal immigration, providing free healthcare to illegals, abolishing private health insurance, banning gas-powered cars, banning fracking, confiscating guns, and so on. Now “taxpayer-funded reparations” are on the chopping block, at least temporarily. Now Harris says that reparations must be “studied.” But that’s already happened too. And it happened in Harris’ home state of California, as I discussed earlier this year, all the way back in February. California established a “reparations task force.” That task force suggested that it would be a good idea to pay more than a million dollars to every descendant of a slave — which, altogether, would cost something like a trillion dollars. And then a bunch of lawmakers decided to reel that back in. They suggested that “reparations” shouldn’t consist of cash payments after all, after Gavin Newsom pointed out that the state is broke and doesn’t have the ability to pay anything. This was a whole conversation that lasted for years, in Harris’ home state. But apparently she’s not aware of this conversation. She wants to keep having it, again and again, for the rest of time. This is a dodge that’s meant to hide the fact that the Biden-Harris administration has already announced massive race-based reparations plans, and continues to do so. They started with billions of dollars in race-based aid to black farmers. They continued with various affirmative action programs in the government — which, as I outlined last week, now involves filing a lawsuit against any fire department or police department that declines to hire black people, regardless of how unqualified they are. And just the other day, Kamala Harris herself personally announced an openly racist policy to send money directly to black people, solely because they’re black. Here’s an image of the plan Kamala Harris’ account posted on social media: Black men deserve a president who cares about making their lives better. pic.twitter.com/cUCdsvvYZ6 — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 15, 2024 Here are the key bullet points: “Provide 1 million loans that are fully forgivable up to $20k for Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business. … Protect cryptocurrency investments so Black men who make them know their money is safe. …. Legalize recreational marijuana and create opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in this new industry.” So, first of all, a loan that’s “fully forgivable” isn’t actually a loan. It’s a cash payout. The government is never going to see any of that money back. But even if this were just a loan, it’d still be a completely unconstitutional, overtly anti-white policy, to the point that it’s insane that any presidential candidate would ever put this in writing. This is a stage of desperation that has no parallel in American politics. Kamala Harris’ campaign is now so underwater among black voters that they’re straight-up offering to hand them cash, and get them some weed. Oh, and they’re going to “protect cryptocurrency investments so black men know their money is safe.” You can read that 20 times, and still have no idea what they’re talking about. Does Bitcoin work differently for black people? And why wouldn’t we want to make sure that everyone — not just black people — feel that their crypto is “safe”? No one knows. Kamala Harris doesn’t know. Imagine asking her to explain what that line means. She probably has no idea someone wrote that and posted it to her account. What’s underlying all of these proposals isn’t just anti-white racism, although that’s a big part of it. This is also about Kamala Harris’ deep and abiding disdain for America and its history. This alone makes her unqualified for the position she’s seeking. It’s the same reason she posted on social media the other day about “Indigenous People’s Day,” instead of Columbus Day. She’s previously gone on the record saying Columbus Day should no longer exist: Kamala Harris: I'll eliminate Columbus Day, make it Indigenous People's Day pic.twitter.com/sM2Um8YrFF — End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) October 14, 2024 We’re at a point in this country where the political Left and Right celebrate different national holidays. And we’re in this position because of politicians like Kamala Harris, who have nothing to offer. So, in the absence of any substance, she’s trying to destroy anything Americans have in common. She’s trying to revise America’s history, which is the go-to move for communist dictators throughout the ages. And for good measure, she’s looting the treasury for the benefit of her preferred racial groups. Fortunately for the Trump campaign, Kamala Harris isn’t capable of hiding any of this. Every time she sits down for an interview, Kamala Harris makes it very clear she doesn’t know anything. She also doesn’t have any idea what she’s saying. She wants to simultaneously signal that she’s backing off reparations, even as she proposes explicit payments to Americans on the basis of their skin color. This is the kind of incoherence that defines the last days of a desperate campaign. And it’s a sign that Kamala Harris’ campaign — like so many other transparent train wrecks in modern politics — is on a path to a very public implosion in just a couple of weeks.

Dhillon then said a prosecutor in Harris’ DA office told her that “as policy, [the office] did not allege prior crime ‘strikes’ in indictments as is routinely done in other counties such as the one where the deputy DA had come from.” That deputy DA “was criticized for alleging strikes; only supervisors were allowed to authorize this and it was rarely done, yet another way Harris went soft on crime,” Dhillon said. “What does it mean when you don’t allege strikes? [I]t means that a career criminal, a violent criminal, who commits multiple crimes gets two years instead of 25 to life.

Dhillon (@pnjaban) October 14, 2024 Dhillon also brought up how Harris violated her pledge to stay under a voluntary spending cap when she ran for DA back in 2003. California’s Ethics Commission claimed the violations were “unintentional,” but Harris was fined $34,000 anyway, the San Francisco Chronicle reported at the time. It was the largest fine under San Francisco’s campaign finance law at the time. After Harris won the election, Dhillon said in a post on X, Harris “immediately sent out mass ‘let’s make a deal’ letters to every defense lawyer with a pending murder case.” “These cases were almost all pled out to manslaughter or even lesser charges, and then Harris claimed these as convictions on murder cases for her closure rate,” Dhillon wrote. “This is unheard of and set a tone of defense lawyers not taking her office seriously.” When Kamala Harris became the DA after violating the campaign finance limits to out-raise and outspend her former boss, who did obey the limits, she immediately sent out mass “let’s make a deal” letters to every defense lawyer with a pending murder case.

Harris also “manipulated the stats as DA by charging only cases that were ‘trial ready’ in the first place — an absurd metric as most cases are built up after charging on a probable cause basis,” Dhillon said. “Even so, her conviction rate was a joke,” Dhillon concluded.

Emhoff, who reportedly hit an ex-girlfriend in the face, had an affair with a nanny and made her get an abortion, and allegedly favored young, attractive women at work, made the comments against his wife on the Dan Le Batard Show. Le Batard told Emhoff that the Second Gentlemen had previously said “communication is key,” but pointed out that Harris couldn’t communicate with her husband on the day Biden announced he would no longer seek re-election. “You were busy in spin class, right?” Le Batard asked as Emhoff nodded and laughed. “That was right,” Emhoff said, smiling. “So, it was… I was in L.A… It was during that weekend when all the planes were down because of the software glitch, so I had to spend an extra day in L.A.” “I decided to go to a cycling class with some friends,” he continued. “And it was an hour class and we were just chit chatting. And I had my phone in the secret service car so I didn’t have my phone. And then my friend’s partner just showed me his phone with the letter from President Biden and I’m like ‘gotta go.’” “And I just ran into the car, and there was my phone literally like you could feel the steam,” he continued. “Seven or eight messages, all with, you know, ‘Where are you?’ Call Kamala, call Kamala. And it was a one minute or less conversation, which started with, ‘Where the f*** were you?

Just one month in Harris’ office traumatized the young man, who decided to leave and intern in then-Sen. Diane Feinstein’s office instead. McAteer asserted that Harris regularly dropped “‘F-bombs’ and other profanity constantly in her berating of staff and others.” He said Harris’ staff was “in complete fear of her” and were instructed to stand every morning when she entered the office and tell her: “Good Morning General.” McAteer said Harris never introduced herself to his son and other staff were too afraid of her to introduce him. His son’s only acknowledgement from Harris came in a form letter signed by Harris given to him on his last day in the office. The son was also instructed never to speak to Harris or look in her eyes – “as that privilege was only allowed to senior staff members.” Around the same time the op-ed resurfaced, Emhoff admitted to cheating on his first wife with the babysitter and impregnating her. “During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions,” Emhoff said in a statement following the original report from The Daily Mail. “I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side.” In early October, Emhoff was accused of hitting his ex-girlfriend in the face at a high-profile event because he thought she was flirting with another man, The Daily Wire previously reported. Three friends of the woman described the incident, which allegedly occurred in 2012. Emhoff has not denied the incident, but called it “a distraction” during a recent interview. Former colleagues have also accused Emhoff of favoring attractive women in the workplace and punishing those who wouldn’t flirt with him, The Daily Wire reported.

I really — could you imagine a white man talking down to black people like that, particularly black men? That’s our issue? Women? It’s not the fact that I don’t have a job or my job is not existing or I’m in a world where, by the way, progressives are erasing me from movies, from billboards, from opportunities.” “The Democratic Party, particularly progressives in Hollywood, Madison Avenue, Washington, D.C., Wall Street, they have erased the black man. There’s no opportunities for black men anywhere in their world, and I think a lot of it centers around what they perceive to be too much toxic masculinity. They hate black masculinity,” Payne continued. “They hate it, and they’ve gone to war with it, and black men have noticed it — and guess what? They’re saying, ‘We’re not going to take it anymore.'” Payne went on to say that black men were tired of being “pimped,” using an example in which black people were used in a state’s campaign to legalize marijuana — and then all of the black applicants were denied licenses to sell it in that state. “They’re not wanted in the white, progressive world,” he said “They’re not wanted, and they’re waking up and pushing back.” He concluded by ripping into Harris’ proposed plan to bring more “opportunities” to black men, arguing that it was all from the same “bag of tricks” that Democrats had been drawing from for years and saying that none of it would actually help.

Vice President Kamala Harris threatened to prosecute fossil fuel executives during her failed 2020 presidential campaign, according to newly surfaced remarks. CNN reported that Harris told voters at a November 2019 town hall in South Carolina that oil companies and fossil fuel companies “should be really prepared to look at a serious fine or be charged with a crime” for their role in what leftists claim is a “climate crisis.” “And, not unlike the tobacco companies, after years — ’cause they’d done the research — they knew the harm that their product was causing,” Harris continued. “They were making so much money that they kept that secret — same thing with these big oil companies. And they need to pay the price.” NEW: Our report last night on OutFrontCNN – As a candidate in 2019, Kamala Harris said she could criminally prosecute oil companies for climate change. Fast forward to 2024, she and Walz are now touting those same companies record oil production under the Biden-Harris admin. pic.twitter.com/mygxdQNDXI — Andy Kaczynski (@KFILE) October 16, 2024 CNN added that Harris made similar remarks at the time in an interview with leftist magazine Mother Jones. “Let’s get them not only in the pocketbook, but let’s make sure there are severe and serious penalties for their behaviors,” she said. Harris — now the Democrat Party’s presidential nominee, despite never earning a single vote from primary voters — is now trying to take credit for the U.S.’s oil and gas production. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 The Biden-Harris administration’s policies have caused the U.S. to fall well behind oil and gas production projections. In 2019, Harris led the charge with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in trying to ram the Green New Deal through Congress, an extreme far-Left climate initiative that would cost tens of trillions of dollars. Harris also said at the time she would ban fracking, a claim that she has now walked back and continued to lie about when it comes to her past comments. “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” she told an audience member during a CNN town hall event in 2019. “And starting with what we can do on day one around public lands, and there has to be legislation. That’s something I’ve taken on in California. I have a history of working on this issue, and to your point, we have to just acknowledge that the residual impact of fracking is enormous in terms of the health and safety of communities.” During an appearance on Jimmy Fallon in 2019, she called climate change the “single greatest threat” facing the world and said she was committed to passing the extreme Green New Deal and “finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.” Harris was asked whether she still supported banning fracking during a softball CNN interview with Dana Bash several weeks ago. “No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking,” she claimed. “As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” A review of Harris’ claims about what she said on the debate stage shows that she was lying. After then-presidential nominee Joe Biden picked her as his running mate, she appeared in one vice presidential debate against Mike Pence in October 2020. During that debate, Harris never stated that she would not ban fracking; she said that Biden would not ban fracking. “Joe Biden will not end fracking,” Harris said. “He has been very clear about that.” Several minutes later, Harris said: “Alright, so first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.

A staggering 85% of voters — including 88% of Republicans and 87% of Democrats — said that they think CBS News should release the full transcript of the interview, while only 15% said it should not release it. 53% said that they believed that the interview was edited to make Harris “look better,” while 47% said that they believed the interview was “fair and objective.” BREAKING: New Harvard Caps Harris Poll “A strong majority of voters (DEM + GOP) think CBS should release the transcript of the 60 Minutes’ Harris interview; A slight majority say CBS edited it to make her look better.” October results page 39👇https://t.co/OOzse0UwCb pic.twitter.com/NPcd8NCINb — Catherine Herridge (@C__Herridge) October 14, 2024 The findings come after the Associated Press reported that the “60 Minutes” interview with Harris was 45 minutes long and was cut down to fit a 20-minute segment that aired on television and separate 6-minute segment that was posted to social media. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 However, less than 15 minutes of the interview was aired between the two segments, meaning that less than one out of every three minutes of film was shown to the public.

In fact, the show has largely avoided answering any questions about it. The moment that sparked controversy on the show happened when host Bill Whitaker was discussing with Harris the United States’ financial support for Israel in its war against genocidal Islamic terrorists in the region. “But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening,” Whitaker said to Harris. In a promotional clip that was posted by CBS News on Sunday, Harris responded to that statement from Whitaker by saying: “The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.” However, when the full interview was published by the network, that statement from Harris was nowhere to be found. Those words were not included anywhere in the television broadcast, nor did they appear in the interview when it was posted on YouTube, the interview’s transcript, or the show’s “Overtime” segment. Instead, on television and in the interview posted online, Whitaker’s identical statement that “it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening” is followed by Harris saying: “We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.” Already have an account?

There is nothing there. People are finally realizing exactly who Kamala Harris is. What they are discovering for the first time, perhaps, is that she is completely vacuous. There is nothing there. Nothing. There has never been anything there. Yesterday, Christopher Rufo, doing his usual yeoman investigative work, broke wide open the reality that Harris is an empty vessel and always was an empty vessel. What he found is that Harris plagiarized at least a dozen sections of her criminal justice book, “Smart on Crime.” She even lifted material directly from Wikipedia. (The first rule of being smart on crime, by the way, is: Do not plagiarize from Wikipedia.) I’ve written 11 books under my own name. I used to ghostwrite for a living, meaning I wrote books under other people’s names. When you are writing factual books, very often you’re relying on media reports. You have to change the wording, and you have to footnote it. Those are just a few of the steps you must take. You have to paraphrase, and then you have to footnote what you wrote. If you don’t do that, it’s plagiarism and stealing. But Harris, apparently without dropping footnotes, just lifted entire paragraphs of text from, for example, the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, the Associated Press, and from Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a good source because it is a compendium of what other people have written about a topic. And the people doing the writing are just randos. It’s not as if someone had written a peer-reviewed book or something equivalent. “The investigation was conducted by Dr. Stefan Weber, a famed Austrian ‘plagiarism hunter’ who has taken down politicians in the German-speaking world,” Rufo noted. “We independently confirmed multiple violations, which are comparable in severity to the plagiarism found in former Harvard president Claudine Gay’s doctoral thesis.” The investigation was conducted by Dr. Stefan Weber, a famed Austrian ""plagiarism hunter"" who has taken down politicians in the German-speaking world.

Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) October 14, 2024 “The allegedly plagiarized sections came from a Bureau of Justice Assistance report in 2000, an Urban Institute report in 2004, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice press release describing a 2007 award, an Associated Press article in 2008, and a Wikipedia article’s wording in a 2008 iteration,” The New York Post reported, adding, “Chronicle executive director of marketing and publicity Lauren Hoffman asked for all inquiries to be forwarded to her, with one employee on the email chain emphasizing that the accusations touched on ‘a very sensitive topic.’” All of this underscores the fact that Harris has always been a giant nothing burger. There is nothing there. You can see it every time she talks. It’s why she spins around in circles: There’s just nothing deeper. We keep trying to scrape beneath the surface and find the deeper level of Kamala Harris. But perhaps it’s just deeper layers of emptiness. Perhaps it turns out that Harris’ core is just a gaping vacuum. Even CNN acknowledged that Harris had likely committed plagiarism, writing, “CNN reviewed several of the passages highlighted by Rufo and found that Harris and O’C. Hamilton failed to properly attribute language to sources.” Why does this matter? Because this is who Kamala Harris is. Vacuous and empty.

Harris recently participated in a slew of relatively friendly interviews, including ABC’s “The View,” Sirius XM radio host Howard Stern, late-night host Stephen Colbert on CBS, and Alex Cooper’s podcast “Call Her Daddy.” Another interview with CBS News’ “60 Minutes” drew controversy because the network deceptively edited remarks from Harris, leading to calls for more transparency and an investigation. Harris has interviews with radio host Charlamagne Tha God and Fox News scheduled this week. During his interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, Trump defended his sweeping plan to implement tariffs on imports after Micklethwait noted it would have a “massive” effect on the economy.

Vice President Kamala Harris and her presidential campaign faced backlash this week after they mocked former President Donald Trump for stopping a town hall event he was participating in after two attendees suffered medical emergencies. Trump was holding a town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania, on Monday evening when two people in the audience fainted. The first person who fainted about 30 minutes into the town hall and had to be placed on a stretcher and taken out of the indoor event, a local ABC News affiliate reported. Shortly after that, another person fainted. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Trump called attention to the people who fainted and directed medical attention to them. The fainting may have been caused by the room being warm because the doors could not be opened for security reasons after Trump survived multiple assassination attempts. Trump then decided to end the formal question and answer portion of the town hall and opted to just have fun with his supporters by listening to music. “Let’s not do any more questions. Let’s just listen to music,” Trump said. “Who the hell wants to hear questions right?” Trump ends his town hall in Pennsylvania after 2 people in the audience suffered medical emergencies “Let’s not do any more questions.

Harris boosted the claims from her campaign’s account and mocked Trump in the process, writing: “Hope he’s okay.” Harris spokesperson Ian Sams also claimed that there was “no explanation of why” he stopped the formal part of the town hall. The Trump campaign fired back at the claims from the Harris campaign: “Meanwhile, back in the real world, what actually happened is President Trump listened to music with his supporters after multiple people needed medical attention.” “The more Kamala’s interns see her poll numbers, the more pathetic the lies become,” they added. The campaign also posted a clip from ABC News that debunked “the pathetic lie” from the Harris campaign. 🚨WATCH: ABC News completely debunks the pathetic lie spread by Kamala and her campaign that President Trump froze on stage at his town hall.

Rufo provided emails sent to Times reporter Stephanie Saul, one of three authors of the article, the headline of which reads: “Conservative Activist Seizes on Passages From Harris Book.” “The Times claims that I only argued that Kamala Harris plagiarized ‘five sections’ involving ‘about 500 words,’” Rufo wrote. “But this isn’t true. In my story, I wrote that Stefan Weber argued there are ‘more than a dozen’ instances of ‘vicious plagiarism.’ This past Saturday, I provided the Times not only with my written analysis, which argues that there are ‘more than a dozen,’ but with Weber’s full dossier, which included 18 allegations of varying severity.” “So, the Times deliberately withheld this crucial contextual information from its readers and from the supposed plagiarism expert, who, based on this limited information, called it ‘not serious,’” Rufo continued. “They could have easily confirmed the “more than a dozen” point, but instead, lied by omission.” The New York Times is lying about my plagiarism story and I have the receipts to prove it: 1.

Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) October 14, 2024 Rufo also criticized the Times for claiming “none of the passages in question took the ideas or thoughts of another writer.” Rufo argued that reasoning was “preposterous.” “Harris not only copied multiple paragraphs of other people’s work verbatim, but she often lifted those ideas directly and at face value,” Rufo said. “In one case, she came to the wrong conclusion because she copied Wikipedia—i.e., she stole a bad idea, copied the language verbatim, and got the point wrong.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 The Times consulted Jonathan Bailey, a plagiarism consultant, who told the outlet that Rufo had taken a relatively small amount of the book and was trying to “make a big deal of it.” But on X, Bailey addressed concerns by saying he had “NOT performed a full analysis of the book,” adding that his comments “were based on information provided to me by the reporters and spoke only about those passages.” For those coming here from the NY Times Article.

This is pure corruption.” The New York Times provided its “plagiarism expert” with only five plagiarized passages—in other words, it deliberately withheld more than a dozen of the accusations in an attempt to manipulate the expert and run interference for Kamala Harris.

When Paul was found to have plagiarized passages, the Times published at least three stories on the matter and one opinion piece. In each example, the word “plagiarism” was used in some form in the headline. As The Daily Wire reported on Monday, the publisher of Harris’ book, Chronicle Books, appears to be in “damage-control mode” after accidentally sending Rufo an email from a higher-up.

The Austrian “Plagiarism Hunter” Stefan Weber posted to his blog on Monday a series of excerpts from the book that appear to be lifted from other sources, including one lengthy passage that appears to have been copied from a 2008 Wikipedia entry. Weber, who has gained fame for uncovering plagiarism cases among German-speaking politicians, said he uncovered 24 blocks of text that appear plagiarized from other authors. Conservative activist Chris Rufo combed through Weber’s examples and spotted “at least a dozen sections” of plagiarized material. He posted some of those excerpts to his X account.

In one example of plagiarism from Harris’ book, she and Hamilton appeared to have lifted a passage from a 2008 Wikipedia article on New York City’s Midtown Community Court, according to Rufo. Rufo quoted a section from the book that was almost entirely taken word-for-word from the Wikipedia entry. At the time the section was allegedly lifted, Wikipedia was considered an unreliable source because of its open-source editing process. Rufo pointed out that the book misquoted a report based on its alleged lifting of Wikipedia’s wording, leading the authors to claim a fact with no supporting evidence. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Harris and Hamilton published the book, titled “Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor’s Plan to Make Us Safer,” ahead of Harris’ campaign for California attorney general as she was beginning her career in elected politics. The book was used to support Harris’ image and credibility for the role she was later to assume. In her current run for president, Harris has been accused of copying several of former president Donald Trump’s campaign promises. In August, Harris announced that she supported eliminating taxes on tips, a promise Trump has made two months earlier. Harris has also portrayed herself as a tough-on-crime prosecutor and border hawk, though Harris also supports amnesty. Already have an account?

I’m not well-versed in DEI rambles."" Vice President Kamala Harris appeared to get sidetracked during an interview with journalist Roland S. Martin, delivering a brief if confusing astronomy lesson during a conversation about her plan to implement policies that will disproportionately benefit black voters. Martin set her up with a question about her political opponent, former President Donald Trump, claiming that he was specifically targeting cities that had high minority populations and attacking them as failing. Martin made no mention of the fact that Detroit — one of the cities in question — has had only Democrat mayors since 1962, but focused solely on racial demographics. The other two cities mentioned, Chicago and Washington, D.C., have been under Democrat control since 1931 and 1967, respectively. Harris nodded in agreement before quickly veering off course.

The poll of Americans from Pew Research, conducted from September 30th to October 6th, found that more than 60 percent say that Democratic candidate for president Kamala Harris has not “clearly explained her policies” regarding illegal immigration. Multiple public opinion surveys have found that illegal immigration is one of the top issues on the minds of voters as the November election draws near. A sizable majority of respondents in the Pew poll, 70 percent, say that former President Donald Trump has clearly articulated his plan to address illegal immigration. The poll, which had 5,110 respondents, also found that majorities also believe that Harris has not clearly explained her positions on strengthening the economy, foreign policy, the wars between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Hamas, or healthcare. Abortion was the only issue from the list of seven that respondents say Harris has adequately explained her stance on. A majority of voters said that Trump has clearly explained his stances on abortion, strengthening the economy, and foreign policy in addition to illegal immigration. The Pew poll results come as the Democratic candidate has attempted to pivot on immigration, marketing herself as a “border state prosecutor” despite the Biden-Harris administration presiding over unprecedented surges in illegal immigration on both the southern and northern borders. One recent advertisement from Harris, which implied that the Democrat was in favor of securing the border, even included a shot of Trump’s border wall. Over 10 million people have crossed the border under the Biden-Harris administration, with an estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrant gotaways recorded since he was inaugurated in 2021. The figures present a stark contrast from the Trump administration, when there were 415,000 total reported gotaways for 2018, 2019, and 2020. Already have an account?

"92","https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamala-campaign-implosion","Kamala Campaign Implosion","The façade is crumbling in Kamala Harris-land. The magic is gone for Kamala Harris, and the current polling shows it. Roughly one month ago, Kamala Harris was leading former President Trump by five percentage points in the NBC News national poll. On Monday, they were dead tied, 48-48. What happened? Was it that Donald Trump suddenly started over-performing? Did he radically change his campaign? Nope. Donald Trump is perfectly consistent. He’s been campaigning in the same fashion today he did roughly ten years ago. So what changed? The answer: The “brat” wore off. The air is out of the balloon. The façade is crumbling in Kamala Harris-land. According to that NBC poll, the impression of candidates left Trump at +43%, -51%. Harris was +43%, -49%. That is a dramatic shift. Last month, Trump was at +40% positive and Harris was at +48%. That means there has been a five-point drop in her favorables since just last month. The poll said men are breaking 56-44 for Donald Trump, which I think is an underestimate. Women are breaking 55-41 for Kamala Harris, which is not nearly as much of a gender gap as Democrats would expect from women. They’re hoping for a 60-40 break. These poll numbers are quite bad for Kamala Harris. And you can see that the panic is beginning to set in. CNN’s Harry Enten at CNN opined that there are a lot of warning signs the klaxons are going off right now; he stated: The GOP leads by a point in party identification right now. The average when the Republican Party loses is the Democrats ahead by eight. When the Republican Party wins, the average party advantage for Democrats is three. Republicans right now are doing even better than the average when they win. If there’s one little nugget that I think Republicans are really hopeful for, it’s this party I.D. and this party registration data. It really points in a good direction for them and for Donald Trump. ABC News’ Martha Raddatz said that polling shows that Americans believe the economy is getting worse, saying: Despite many positive economic signs, some 59% of Americans say they believe the economy is getting worse, compared to just 23% who say it’s getting better, with more Americans trusting Trump to handle the economy if he wins a second term. So as it turns out, Americans trust Trump on the economy, and not just on the economy; they trust Trump on foreign policy. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump leads Harris among swing-state voters 52-39 on handling Russia’s war in Ukraine and 48-33 on handling the Israel-Hamas war. If you look at the latest polling data on the last seven polls taken in the state of Michigan, Donald Trump is either in the lead or tied in six of them. The only poll that has Kamala Harris ahead is the Wall Street Journal poll. That is from October 8. And that poll shows her up by only two. Meanwhile, over in Pennsylvania, in the last five polls that have been taken, Trump is in the lead in three of them. If you go back a little further than that, if you go back to the last seven polls taken, he’s ahead in five of them. If you move on over to Wisconsin, every single poll of the last three has them tied, and in the two before that, Trump is winning. The latest Wall Street Journal poll has Donald Trump up six points in Nevada. These are awful numbers for Kamala Harris. The “brat” has worn off. And the “joy” is gone.

Then we’re all the way down to Biden last time around by 53. A tremendous drop already. And then you take a look at the average of the most recent polls and Kamala Harris is up by only 41 points. That is about half the margin that Obama won them by back in November of 2012.” Asked about black men overall, Enten responded, “We’re looking once again at younger black men at what looks like the worst Democratic performance since 1960 since JFK versus Richard Nixon. It’s the same thing among black men overall. Again, part of a similar trend, but here, actually, the drop off isn’t as dramatic, right? Barack Obama won him by 85. Then you see 71 Clinton, 69 Biden, basically the same thing holding steady. But here, again, very, very weak, only a 54-point margin. Now, again, still winning them by a large margin, but considerably lower than what we’re used to. Certainly, considerably lower than what we had during the Obama years. The bottom line is Kamala Harris with younger black men and then black men overall putting in historically weak performance for a Democratic candidate.” In mid-September, Reuters reported, “Over one quarter of younger Black men say they would support Republican candidate Donald Trump in this year’s U.S. presidential election, an NAACP poll showed on Friday.” Already have an account?

One of the biggest points of contention between the two camps is President Joe Biden’s praise and discussions with Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis following two major hurricanes, Axios reported. A Harris campaign staffer told the outlet that the “White House is lacking someone in the room thinking first and foremost about how things would affect the campaign.” The issue stems from early last week when Harris attempted to insert herself into hurricane relief operations by attacking DeSantis for purportedly not taking her phone call. Harris had called DeSantis “utterly irresponsible” and “selfish” even though disaster had just struck Florida and the vice president had no role in disaster relief, The Daily Wire reported at the time. Shortly after, Biden’s social media team posted on X to say that the president was working with DeSantis. “Tonight, I spoke with Florida Governor DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Castor for firsthand reports on Hurricane Helene recovery and preparations for Hurricane Milton,” the post said. “My Administration is ready to support both leaders and the people of Florida with any further resources they may need.” DeSantis also pushed back on Harris’ claims about a phone call, saying he had never received calls from her before and she had never been involved in any of his administration’s disaster response efforts previously. He added that she had “no role” in the process and wasn’t even in the chain of command on the issue. The day after Biden’s post on X, Harris appeared on “The View” for a softball interview, but Biden decided to appear at a press conference at the same time. During that press conference, Biden discussed his work with DeSantis on hurricane relief efforts. “The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he’s gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday, and I said, ‘You’re doing a great job. It’s being all being done. We thank you for it. And I literally gave my personal phone number to call,” Biden said. During that press conference, Biden also undermined Harris’ campaign message of being a change candidate, saying she was directly connected to all of his policy decisions. “Well, she’s — I’m in constant contact with her,” Biden said. “She’s aware of where — we all — we’re singing from the same song sheet. She helped pass all the laws that are being employed now.” “She was a major player in everything we’ve done, including passage of legislation, which we were told we could never pass,” he continued. “And so, she’s been — and her — her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we’re doing.” The tensions between Biden and Harris emerged after Democrats pushed Biden to drop out of his re-election bid and inserted Harris as the nominee in order to keep the campaign cash Biden raised.

Former President Donald Trump said on Sunday night that Vice President Kamala Harris should take a “test on cognitive stamina and agility,” arguing that her “slow and lethargic” answers during interviews are concerning. Trump called on Harris, 59, to pass a cognitive test after the Democratic presidential nominee released a medical report on Saturday, which stated that she has “the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.” Harris used her medical report to attack Trump, suggesting that the 78-year-old former president is hiding whether he is fit for office. Trump fired back, writing on Truth Social, “I believe it is very important that Kamala Harris pass a test on Cognitive Stamina and Agility. Her actions have led many to believe that there could be something very wrong with her.” “Even 60 Minutes and CBS, in order to protect Lyin’ Kamala, illegally and unscrupulously replaced an answer she had given, which was totally ‘bonkers,’ with another answer that had nothing to do with the question asked,” Trump added. “Also, she is slow and lethargic in answering even the easiest of questions. We just went through almost four years of that, we shouldn’t have to do it again!” Harris was slammed by conservatives, including Trump, for dodging questions on illegal immigration during her “60 Minutes” interview last week, an interview from which the news show still has not released the transcripts. U.S. senators and former CBS reporters have called on “60 Minutes” to release the transcripts after the news show was blasted for appearing to edit the interview with Harris in a way that helped her. The Trump campaign responded to Harris’ calls for Trump to release more medical records by pointing to a doctor’s report from last November along with “detailed reports” on Trump’s recovery following the assassination attempt on him in July. In November of 2023, Trump released a three-paragraph letter from his doctor which stated that the former president’s “overall health is excellent,” adding that his “cognitive exams were exceptional.” Trump campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement on Saturday, “President Trump has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician, as well as detailed reports from Dr. Ronny Jackson who treated him after the first assassination attempt. All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief.” Dr. Jackson is a Republican congressman representing Texas and served as White House physician during the Obama and Trump administrations.

Sunny Hostin claimed on Monday that Vice President Kamala Harris — who is steadily losing ground in most polls — has run a “flawless” campaign so far. Hostin made the comments during a Columbus Day broadcast of ABC’s “The View,” and she argued that if Harris was floundering in the polls, it was the media to blame for not taking up for her as much as they should. WATCH: When answering why Kamala Harris isn't winning in the polls, Sunny Hostin claims Harris is ""running a flawless campaign.""Hostin insists ""the press to blame for"" Harris's polling problems. ""I think that the media has to do a much better job than what they're doing."" pic.twitter.com/wrwF43OZaX — Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) October 14, 2024 Hostin, responding to a series of polls that have shown Harris flagging with men — even black men — and the latest NBC poll showed that any lead the vice president had garnered from the September 10 debate has since evaporated. “Look, I think that Kamala Harris has been running a flawless campaign,” Hostin said, arguing that she would not have been able to raise $1 billion if there was no real momentum behind her. “I think it’s because people believe in her, and I think people are showing that by the amount of money that they are willing to give to the campaign.” “I think we have the press to blame for a lot of this,” she added. “Whoopi, you always say that you don’t believe in polls. I’m with you now, because I’m reading the press. First it was, ‘Kamala’s not doing enough press.’ Then she goes on this huge press tour, she was here, with us, I thought she was fantastic.” Hostin left out the fact that Harris, during her appearance on “The View,” had flubbed even the softest of softball questions when she failed to answer how she would do anything differently than President Joe Biden had. “The crowd went wild, it was electric,” Hostin continued. “CNN: ‘Democrats grow anxious’; Axios: ‘Blue wall blues’; Fox: ‘Dems are scared to death.’ No! Dems are not scared to death. Dems are pumped.” Hostin went on to explain what she thought the press should be covering, beginning by echoing Harris’ recent speech verbatim and claiming that Trump was “in hiding” because he didn’t do the “60 Minutes” interview. She made no mention of Harris’ refusal to do the traditional candidate sit-down with TIME Magazine. She concluded by arguing that they were too focused on former President Barack Obama’s insulting comments toward black men — namely that if they weren’t falling in line behind Harris, they were sexists — and not focused enough on his “captivating” formal speeches.

"98","https://www.dailywire.com/news/spin-cycle-kamala-surrogates-explain-away-her-man-problem","Spin Cycle: Kamala Surrogates Explain Away Her Man Problem","""A lot of men think Democrats care more about dudes who want to become women than they do about dudes who just wanna be dudes."" For those who don’t spend their Sunday mornings glued to the television — and their Sunday afternoons attempting to dig through a week’s worth of network and cable news media spin — The Daily Wire has compiled a short summary of what you may have missed. With less than a month to go before the general election on November 5, the campaigns are pulling out all the stops — and so are the campaign surrogates. Several of them made the rounds on Sunday morning, hitting the political talk shows to spin recent polls showing that Vice President Kamala Harris has a serious problem with male voters. In recent weeks numerous outlets have reported on the fact that Harris has struggled to gain support among male voters. “Morning Joe” regular Katty Kay laid out the issue just ahead of the vice presidential debate between Governor Tim Walz (D-MN) and Senator JD Vance (R-OH), saying, “But it’s men, I think the real struggle for the Harris campaign, is young men, old men, men of color, white men.” Since then, the Harris campaign has leaned into Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff — but reports of him allegedly engaging in violent behavior with a former girlfriend raised concerns about making him so public-facing in the final weeks of the campaign. Walz has also embarked on a media blitz — but in the space of just one week he managed to call for an end to the Electoral College, tell comedian Jimmy Kimmel (and millions of Americans) that the Vice President of the United States is “the dry cleaner” on his phone, and flub loading his own personal shotgun during a staged pheasant hunt. This week, they brought in the big (metaphorical) guns: former President Barack Obama. But as CNN commentator Scott Jennings pointed out, Obama’s solution to the men-not-liking-Kamala-Harris problem was to scold them and label them misogynists for not supporting her anyway. “And you are thinking about sitting out?” Obama asked. “Part of it makes me think — and I’m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.” Jennings responded by saying, “This plea he’s making to African American men, I mean, he said today – he insulted them! … I don’t think it’s helpful to insult a group of people who are already not enthusiastic about your campaign, but I think that’s what he did today.” But the Democratic Party does not appear to have gotten the message. Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) doubled down on Obama’s rhetoric on CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” where he told host Margaret Brennan that he believed misogyny was behind a lot of the reluctance to support Harris. “I think President Obama was just having some very serious tough talk, right, tough love,” Frost added. “He was speaking directly to young Black voters, young Black men specifically, and making sure that they understand [that] look, sometimes you have to take a step back and look at your own bias,” he said. .@RepMaxwellFrost says he shares former President Obama’s concern about sexism impacting support for Harris among some male voters. “I think President Obama was just having some very serious tough talk, right, tough love,” Frost added. “He was speaking directly to young Black… pic.twitter.com/1dfSkwIGLQ — Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 13, 2024 Frost went on to suggest that young voters might bridge the gap, however — despite the fact that voters aged 18-29 are typically the least active voting bloc. “Young people are voting at the highest numbers in our country’s history,” he said. “We’re trending in the right direction. We just need to continue to reach out to young people, not take those votes for granted.” ""We can do better"" to engage young voters, says @RepMaxwellFrost, but he adds that he has seen ""a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around this election"" among young people. “Young people are voting at the highest numbers in our country's history,” Frost tells @margbrennan.… pic.twitter.com/pLn0pV3TtI — Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) October 13, 2024 On CNN’s “State of the Union,” anchor Dana Bash asked Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) to weigh in on the situation, and he conceded that he is concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for Harris particularly among black males — and he worried that some might simply not vote at all. “I am concerned about black men staying home or voting for Trump,” he said, explaining that they may feel like Harris has not done enough to tell them what she would do for them and their community as president. .@RepJamesClyburn tells @DanaBashCNN, “Yes, I am concerned about Black men staying home or voting for Trump.” pic.twitter.com/Unj6bftip7 — State of the Union (@CNNSOTU) October 13, 2024 Senator Raphael Warnock (D-GA) also joined the program, and he started off by trying to run cover for Obama. “I have a great deal of respect for President Obama, and he wasn’t talking to all Black men. He was talking to men who we’re talking about sitting on the sidelines,” he explained. .@SenatorWarnock responds to Barack Obama’s sharp criticism of Black men on the fence about Harris: “I have a great deal of respect for President Obama, and he wasn't talking to all Black men. He was talking to men who we're talking about sitting on the sidelines.” pic.twitter.com/LlRXMqmXAb — State of the Union (@CNNSOTU) October 13, 2024 Warnock then tried to wave away concerns about black men voting Republican, claiming that it would never happen in any real way: “We’re not a monolith, but this idea that large numbers of black men are going to vote for Donald Trump, it’s not going to happen.” “We're not a monolith, but this idea that large numbers of Black men are going to vote for Donald Trump, it's not going to happen.”@SenatorWarnock responds to concerns from Democrats that some Black men could stay home or vote for Trump in November. pic.twitter.com/qUZ835kjM2 — State of the Union (@CNNSOTU) October 13, 2024 Jennings wasn’t buying any of that, however, and during a panel discussion to round out the program, he argued that the Democrats’ efforts to reach out to male voters was likely too little, too late. “They’re struggling with — I mean, the front page of The New York Times this morning, Democrats struggling with African-American voters, particularly African-American men — this gender gap issue is real,” he said. “It’s a real problem and you see the Democrats reacting to it, and I think what they are now — finally in October of the election coming to realize — is that a lot of men think Democrats care more about dudes who want to become women than they do about dudes who just wanna be dudes,” Jennings said, continuing over the outraged protests of several fellow panelists. “No amount of hunting cosplay or cringy videos is gonna change it. The bed is made.” Me, on Harris’s problems w/ working class men of all races on @cnn: “Alot of men think Democrats care more about dudes who want to become women than they do about dudes just wanna be dudes.

"99","https://www.dailywire.com/news/kamalas-wins-viral-source-of-pro-kamala-misinformation-was-launched-by-biden-admin-employee","Viral Account Pushing Pro-Kamala Misinformation Was Launched By Biden Admin Employee","Founder of ‘Kamala's Wins’ account is working in Biden-Harris admin, earning taxpayer-funded salary When Kamala Harris took Joe Biden’s spot at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket, she also replaced him as the focus of Democrats’ favorite X account. In July, the popular “Biden’s Wins” account rebranded itself to “Kamala’s Wins,” and now boasts that it’s the “largest online community supporting soon to be President Kamala Harris.” With over 765,000 followers, the account sits at the center of a Democratic influence operation, pushing false narratives to millions of potential voters. And its founder, a Biden-Harris administration staffer, may be violating federal law by running it. The Biden’s Wins account was launched in January 2022 by Ethan Wolf, a recent college graduate who was working as deputy political director for Illinois Democrat Brad Schneider’s reelection campaign. Wolf’s account quickly became “a favorite of White House staffers” such as Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff, and in July 2022, his account was profiled by POLITICO. By September 2022, Wolf was invited to the White House “for a private briefing with the President, Vice-President, Ron Klain,” Wolf said on Facebook. A month later, Wolf was back at the White House for another content creator briefing, posing for photos with top White House officials and Doug Emhoff. I am once again asking you to stand with President Biden and me. Retweet and vote in the poll below. https://t.co/1aJHPNLnNP pic.twitter.com/ztbOvXrNUe — Ethan Wolf 🇺🇸 (@ethanmwolf) March 28, 2024 Just over a year after launching the account praising Biden, Wolf had earned himself a job in the administration. In June 2023, Wolf was hired as a “communications specialist” in the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration, where he makes $94,000 a year, according to disclosure forms. The timing of these events raises questions about the Biden-Harris administration’s relationship with Wolf. The Harris campaign, responding to one of the many viral lies that originated with his account, told PolitiFact it is not affiliated with Kamala’s Wins, though it seems that Harris and the administration have worked closely with Wolf from the beginning of his career, when he was fresh out of Ohio State University. An administration official posting from the Kamala’s Wins account while working at the Commerce Department would be an apparent violation of the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in political activity while on duty or in a federal building. Asked about Wolf’s employment and political activity, a Commerce Department spokesman told The Daily Wire: “All Department of Commerce employees are subject to the Hatch Act, which is the law that governs political activities for federal employees.” Wolf, who could not be reached for comment, would not be the first member of the Biden-Harris administration to violate the Hatch Act. In October 2022, Klain was found to have violated the Hatch Act with a post from that previous May. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra was charged with a violation in April 2023, and White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre just two months later. Jean-Pierre’s predecessor, Jen Psaki, received a warning about violating the Hatch Act in 2021. Nor would Kamala’s Wins be the only thing that potentially put Wolf on the wrong side of the Hatch Act. He has repeatedly shared political content from his personal X account during work hours, as recently as September 25. Wolf, Pete Buttigieg, and Democrat influencer Harry Sisson at the White House in 2022 (Ethan Wolf/Facebook) Wolf appears to have launched the Biden’s Wins account as part of a business strategy. The same year he launched the account, Wolf also formed a company called “Democratic Wins Media LLC.” The Biden’s Wins X account seems to have been part of that operation: in June 2023, the account and several other “wins” accounts — “Democratic Wins,” “Pete’s [Buttigieg] Wins,” and “[Hillary] Clinton’s Wins” — reposted a campaign video for Shadia Martini, a Democratic candidate for Michigan state representative. Two days later, Martini’s campaign paid Wolf’s company $2,000. Since transforming into Kamala’s Wins, the account has been a major source of false information. The account was widely fact checked after it erroneously claimed that a number of NFL quarterbacks, including Joe Burrow, were part of a “White Dudes for Harris” fundraising call. The account has promoted the false claim that former President Donald Trump is attached to Project 2025, and repeated frequently debunked claims about Trump’s 2017 remarks in Charlottesville, Virginia. The account has frequently misconstrued facts to present Harris’ record in a positive light, falsely claiming that Biden-Harris administration policies have caused inflation and grocery prices to plummet, and led to a reduction in violent crime. Wolf’s political work for Biden and Harris began as a 20-year-old Ohio State University student in 2020, when he launched “Jews 4 Joe” to help elect Biden. He told POLITICO that his work was what initially put him on the White House’s radar. Happy birthday, @POTUS. Thanks for all your doing for our great nation. Special thank you for giving young leaders a seat at your table. pic.twitter.com/7zaRSFzBm5 — Ethan Wolf 🇺🇸 (@ethanmwolf) November 20, 2023 Wolf also appears to have launched an X account that same year called Jews 4 Kanye, a reference to the openly anti-Semitic rapper Kanye West. The account’s bio reads: “Jews love Kanye & Kanye loves the Jews.” One of the account’s only six followers is an Ohio State classmate of Wolf’s. Posts from Kamala’s Wins account continue to reach millions of people a day in the final stretch of the campaign. Over the past weekend, the account posted repeatedly that Trump is “senile.” In his personal capacity, Wolf insisted in February 2024 that Biden was mentally competent, just five months before a series of embarrassing mental gaffes forced Biden to suspend his presidential campaign.
