Full text: AI-generated images are everywhere. They're being used to make nonconsensual pornography, muddy the truth during elections and promote products on social media using celebrity impersonations.
When Princess Catherine released a video last month disclosing that she had cancer, social media went abuzz with the latest baseless claim that artificial intelligence was used to manipulate the video. Both BBC Studios, which shot the video, and Kensington Palace denied AI was involved. But it didn't stop the speculation.
Experts say the problem is only going to get worse. Today, the quality of some fake images is so good that they're nearly impossible to distinguish from real ones. In one prominent case, a finance manager at a Hong Kong bank wired about $25.6 million to fraudsters who used AI to pose as the worker's bosses on a video call. And the tools to make these fakes are free and widely available.
A growing group of researchers, academics and start-up founders are working on ways to track and label AI content. Using a variety of methods and forming alliances with news organizations, Big Tech companies and even camera manufacturers, they hope to keep AI images from further eroding the public's ability to understand what's true and what isn't.
"A year ago, we were still seeing AI images and they were goofy," said Rijul Gupta, founder and CEO of DeepMedia AI, a deepfake detection start-up. "Now they're perfect."
Here's a rundown of the major methods being developed to hold back the AI image apocalypse.
Watermarking AI images Digital watermarks aren't new. They've been used for years by record labels and movie studios that want to be able to protect their content from being pirated. But they've become one of the most popular ideas to help deal with a wave of AI-generated images.
When President Biden signed a landmark executive order on AI in October, he directed the government to develop standards for companies to follow in watermarking their images.
Some companies already put visible labels on images made by their AI generators. OpenAI affixes five small colored boxes in the bottom-right corner of images made with its Dall-E image generators. But the labels can easily be cropped or photoshopped out of the image. Other popular AI image-generation tools like Stable Diffusion don't even add a label.
So the industry is focusing more on unseen watermarks that are baked into the image itself. They're not visible to the human eye but could be detected by, say, a social media platform, which would then label them before viewers see them.
They're far from perfect though. Earlier versions of watermarks could be easily removed or tampered with by simply changing the colors in an image or even flipping it on its side. Google, which provides image-generation tools to its consumer and business customers, said last year that it had developed a watermark tech called SynthID that could withstand tampering.
But in a February paper, researchers at the University of Maryland showed that approaches developed by Google and other tech giants to watermark their AI images could be beat.
"That is not going to solve the problem," said Soheil Feizi, one of the researchers.
Developing a robust watermarking system that Big Tech and social media platforms agree to abide by should help significantly reduce the problem of deepfakes misleading people online, said Nico Dekens, director of intelligence at cybersecurity company ShadowDragon, a start-up that makes tools to help people run investigations using images and social media posts from the internet.
"Watermarking will definitely help," Dekens said. But "it's certainly not a waterproof solution, because anything that's digitally pieced together can be hacked or spoofed or altered," he said.
Labeling real images On top of watermarking AI images, the tech industry has begun talking about labeling real images as well, layering data into each pixel right when a photo is taken by a camera to provide a record of what the industry calls its "provenance."
Even before OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022 and kicked off the AI boom, camera makers Nikon and Leica began developing ways to imprint special "metadata" that lists when and by whom a photo was taken directly when the image is made by the camera. Canon and Sony have begun similar programs, and Qualcomm, which makes computer chips for smartphones, says it has a similar project to add metadata to images taken on phone cameras.
News organizations like the BBC, Associated Press and Thomson Reuters are working with the camera companies to build systems to check for the authenticating data before publishing photos.
Social media sites could pick up the system, too, labeling real and fake images as such, helping users know what they're looking at, similar to how some platforms label content that might contain anti-vaccine disinformation or government propaganda. The sites could even prioritize real content in algorithmic recommendations or allow users to filter out AI content.
But building a system where real images are verified and labeled on social media or a news website might have unintended effects. Hackers could figure out how the camera companies apply the metadata to the image and add it to fake images, which would then get a pass on social media because of the fake metadata.
"It's dangerous to believe there are actual solutions against malignant attackers," said Vivien Chappelier, head of research and development at Imatag, a start-up that helps companies and news organizations put watermarks and labels on real images to ensure they aren't misused. But making it harder to accidentally spread fake images or giving people more context into what they're seeing online is still helpful.
"What we are trying to do is raise the bar a bit," Chappelier said.
Adobe — which has long sold photo- and video-editing software and is now offering AI image-generation tools to its customers — has been pushing for a standard for AI companies, news organizations and social media platforms to follow in identifying and labeling real images and deepfakes.
AI images are here to stay and different methods will have to be combined to try to control them, said Dana Rao, Adobe's general counsel.
Detection software Some companies, including Reality Defender and Deep Media, have built tools that detect deepfakes based on the foundational technology used by AI image generators.
By showing tens of millions of images labeled as fake or real to an AI algorithm, the model begins to be able to distinguish between the two, building an internal "understanding" of what elements might give away an image as fake. Images are run through this model, and if it detects those elements, it will pronounce that the image is AI-generated.
The tools can also highlight which parts of the image the AI thinks gives it away as fake. While humans might class an image as AI-generated based on a weird number of fingers, the AI often zooms in on a patch of light or shadow that it deems doesn't look quite right.
There are other things to look for, too, such as whether a person has a vein visible in the anatomically correct place, said Ben Colman, founder of Reality Defender. "You're either a deepfake or a vampire," he said.
Colman envisions a world where scanning for deepfakes is just a regular part of a computer's cybersecurity software, in the same way that email applications like Gmail now automatically filter out obvious spam. "That's where we're going to go," Colman said.
But it's not easy. Some warn that reliably detecting deepfakes will probably become impossible, as the tech behind AI image generators changes and improves.
"If the problem is hard today, it will be much harder next year," said Feizi, the University of Maryland researcher. "It will be almost impossible in five years."
Assume it's fake Even if all these methods are successful and Big Tech companies get fully on board, people will still need to be critical about what they see online.
"Assume nothing, believe no one and nothing, and doubt everything," said Dekens, the open-source investigations researcher. "If you're in doubt, just assume it's fake."
With elections coming up in the United States and other major democracies this year, the tech may not be ready for the amount of disinformation and AI-generated fake imagery that will be posted online.
"The most important thing they can do for these elections coming up now is tell people they shouldn't believe everything they see and hear," said Rao, the Adobe general counsel.

WASHINGTON — Michael J. Gottlieb can never remember the exact amount — it’s $148,169,000 — that a jury ordered Rudy Giuliani to pay the Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. But Freeman’s words after the December 2023 victory are indelible to him.
“Don’t waste your time being angry at those who did this to me and my daughter,” said Freeman, 65, who with her daughter Moss, 39, was falsely accused by Giuliani of aiding an imagined plot to steal the 2020 presidential election.
“We are more than conquerors.”
Less than a decade ago, the two women would have struggled to find a lawyer. But Gottlieb, a partner at the firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher and a former associate counsel in the Obama White House, represented them for free. Convinced that viral lies threaten public discourse and democracy, he is at the forefront of a small but growing cadre of lawyers deploying defamation, one of the oldest areas of the law, as a weapon against a tide of political disinformation.
Gottlieb has also represented the owner of the Washington pizzeria targeted by “Pizzagate” conspiracy theorists as well as the brother of Seth Rich, a young Democratic National Committee staff member whose 2016 murder ignited bogus theories implicating his family. In the Giuliani case, Gottlieb, his law partner Meryl Governski and other members of his team worked with Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan group that pushes for laws and policies to counter what it sees as authoritarian threats.
Before the Trump era and the explosion of social media, though, such cases were virtually nonexistent.
“The new information landscape we’re in is a little bit like the Wild West — a lawless space,” said Ian Bassin, a co-founder of Protect Democracy. Lawyers, he said, have turned to defamation, which is legally defined as any false information, either published, broadcast or spoken, that harms the reputation of a person, business or organization. “It’s one of the most effective and only strategies for dealing with these out-and-out falsehoods,” Bassin said.
In the past few years, more than a dozen high-profile defamation cases have made their way through the courts. A majority have been brought against defendants on the right, but the right brings lawsuits, too, often against media organizations.
In 2020 and 2021, The Washington Post, CNN and NBC settled a defamation case brought by Nick Sandmann, a Kentucky high school student, who said the outlets had wrongly described his encounter with a Native American elder as a racially tinged confrontation. Sandmann’s suit against other outlets, including The New York Times, ended last week when the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
Payouts have been particularly large for defamation cases against the right. In January, lawyer Roberta Kaplan defeated former President Donald Trump in court when a jury ordered him to pay $83 million for defaming her client, E. Jean Carroll, after he was found to have sexually abused her. Last year, lawyers from the firm Susman Godfrey secured a $787.5 million settlement for Dominion Voting Systems from Fox News, one of the biggest ever in a defamation case, after Fox aired bogus theories falsely linking the company to election fraud. In late 2022, Sandy Hook families defamed by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones won a total of nearly $1.5 billion from juries in Texas and Connecticut, though Jones has yet to pay them anything.
In other cases, the people harmed, like Freeman and Moss, cannot afford lawyers or struggle to find firms willing to pursue defendants unable or resistant to paying big damages, like Giuliani. Gottlieb has tried to fill that gap.
“The cost of bringing a defamation suit to trial can be enormous, often exceeding a quarter-million dollars’ worth of expenses, to say nothing of the value of attorney time,” said Mark Bankston, a lawyer for some of the Sandy Hook families defamed by Jones.
Gottlieb and his team refer to their cases as a “hobby” in service to those whose lives and reputations have been damaged by people with power and large online followings. “I’ve always despised bullies that pick on defenseless or seemingly defenseless people,” Gottlieb, 47, said in an interview in his K Street office in Washington. “There are so many ways to make your political points without endangering individual people’s lives.”
Gottlieb’s day job is filled with the powerful client list more typical of big Washington law firms. He has represented Venezuela’s Citgo petroleum company; helped billionaire Steven A. Cohen beat a potential lifetime ban on managing client money after accusations of insider trading at Cohen’s former hedge fund; and worked with President Joe Biden’s son Hunter on behalf of a Romanian real estate tycoon whose seven-year prison sentence for corruption was later vacated by a Romanian court.
“I understand there are definitely people who would say, ‘Wait a minute — litigation for Citgo is not the same as the litigation you’re doing for Ruby and Shaye,’” he said. “I feel fortunate to have had a career where I’ve had a wide variety of cases and have a practice that works different skill sets and different parts of my brain.
“However people want to think about it and look at it is sort of fine with me.”
The Post-Truth World
Gottlieb, who was a clerk for Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and served on an Obama administration anti-corruption task force in Afghanistan, had his first foray into the post-truth world in 2016. That was when Jones and his Infowars outlet spread the lie that Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party operatives were running a child sex trafficking ring out of Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizzeria owned by James Alefantis.
In December of that year, a man who had been bingeing on Infowars “Pizzagate” episodes fired a rifle inside the restaurant. No one was injured, but the gunman’s trip to Washington to avenge an imagined crime foreshadowed a series of violent attacks by conspiracy theorists, including the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.
Jones insisted that the First Amendment protected the lies he had broadcast, like most defendants in these cases. But threatened with a lawsuit, he made an on-air retraction and removed all Pizzagate content from Infowars’ website and social media channels. The full settlement remains confidential.
Soon after the Pizzagate case, Gottlieb represented Aaron Rich, whose brother Seth Rich, 27, worked for the Democratic National Committee and was gunned down in a botched robbery in 2016. The case remains unsolved, and wild theories that Seth Rich was killed by Democrats spread from online fever swamps to Fox News. Aaron Rich and his parents were implicated in the plots, doxxed and harassed.
“If this had happened to me or my brother or sister, and somebody was doing this to my parents, I would go ballistic,” Gottlieb said. “And no one was helping them.”
In 2018, Gottlieb and Aaron Rich sued The Washington Times as well as an internet provocateur, Matt Couch, and a businessperson, Ed Butowsky, for spreading falsehoods that the two brothers had sold DNC documents in a plot that resulted in Seth Rich’s murder. Aaron Rich eventually received a confidential settlement that included a retraction of the falsehoods spread by both men and the newspaper, as well as an apology to the Rich family. Rich’s parents retained Susman Godfrey and sued Fox News. They obtained a confidential cash settlement, but no apology.
The Rich case had taken years. At one point Gottlieb was named in a sweeping defamation lawsuit filed by one of the defendants, which was later dropped.
The aftermath of the 2020 election brought more calls from potential clients. Gottlieb appealed for help to Bassin, the co-founder of Protect Democracy, who had served with Gottlieb in the Obama White House Counsel’s Office.
The Georgia Case
Less than two months later, Gottlieb and his team were writing the complaint in Ruby Freeman, et al., v. Rudolph Giuliani.
In his frenzied public scramble to make his case that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, Giuliani, the former president’s lawyer, had spread the false story that Freeman and her daughter Moss had colluded to falsify results while counting ballots in Georgia. He falsely claimed that a video showing Freeman handing a small item to her daughter — a ginger mint — was the two women exchanging USB thumb drives “as if they’re vials of heroin and cocaine.”
Trump echoed the bogus allegations. In an infamous taped phone call with Georgia election officials, Trump named Freeman again and again, calling her a “professional vote scammer” and “hustler.”
Threats poured in to the two women. People called them traitors and, using racial slurs, demanded they be lynched or shot. Others banged on Freeman’s front door and lurked outside her home, forcing her into hiding. Moss had to give up her job as an election worker and struggled to find work.
Giuliani said he would prove his innocence. But he failed to submit court-ordered documents, testify or call witnesses. In the courtroom, he fiddled with his phone and rolled his eyes while the two women described their terror.
In December, a jury in federal court in Washington ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss the $148 million. The case was put on hold after Giuliani declared bankruptcy, and Freeman and Moss are now suing Giuliani again, for his continued false statements about them.
Law for Truth, part of Protect Democracy, has in the meantime filed defamation suits against the makers of the election conspiracy theory film “2000 Mules”; James O’Keefe, the former leader of Project Veritas, a right-wing group known for its sting operations; and Kari Lake, a candidate for U.S. Senate in Arizona, on behalf of people smeared by lies Lake told about the 2020 election.
Despite the activity, lawyers who see themselves as crusaders against lies are not declaring victory. Their cases are high profile and target key disinformation spreaders, but they acknowledge that they do not put a dent in more general widespread disinformation, like false statements about COVID vaccines.
“I think these lawsuits may be effective in stemming some of the worst viral disinformation,” said Katie Fallow, a senior counsel at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “But there may be limits to how effective these lawsuits can be when there are other incentives, particularly political ones, to keep spreading it.”

Full text: 25% of adults say FBI instigated riot
Post-UMD poll finds 34% of Republicans hold view Twenty-five percent of Americans say it is "probably" or "definitely" true that the FBI instigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, a false concept promoted by right-wing media and repeatedly denied by federal law enforcement, according to a new Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.
The Post-UMD poll finds a smaller 11 percent of the public overall thinks there is "solid evidence" that FBI operatives organized and encouraged the attack, while 13 percent say this is their "suspicion only."
Among Republicans, 34 percent say the FBI organized and encouraged the insurrection, compared with 30 percent of independents and 13 percent of Democrats.
The results confirm that misinformation about Jan. 6 is widespread as the United States begins a presidential election year, during a campaign in which the former president and leading Republican candidate Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed support for those who participated in the insurrection. Despite a detailed congressional investigation and more than 725 completed federal prosecutions of Jan. 6 participants that did not yield evidence of FBI involvement, a substantial minority of Americans still embraces conspiracy theories not unlike the ones that drove many rioters to storm the Capitol three years ago.
"The people that went there to express their views, to support Trump, were peaceful," said Richard Baum, 61, an independent voter from Odessa, Tex. "The government implants were the violent ones: the FBI, the police people that were put in there, the antifa and BLM hired by George Soros; everybody knows that."
The Post-UMD poll finds 39 percent of Americans who say Fox News is their primary news source believe the FBI organized and encouraged the Jan. 6 attack, compared with 16 percent of CNN or MSNBC viewers and 13 percent who get most of their news from ABC, CBS or NBC. The poll finds 44 percent of those who voted for Trump say the FBI instigated the attack.
About 700 Jan. 6 defendants have pleaded guilty to federal crimes ranging from trespassing to violent assaults on police, and another 130 have been convicted at trial, after Trump directed angry supporters to march to the Capitol to oppose Congress's confirmation of the 2020 election results. In numerous hearings and trials, attorneys for defendants - including "QAnon Shaman" Jacob Chansley and ex-Proud Boy leader Henry "Enrique" Tarrio - have blamed Trump for the attack or their behavior in subsequent rioting that day, citing Trump's encouragement to "fight like hell" and his false claims of massive voter fraud.
The FBI has categorically rejected allegations of any involvement in sparking the Capitol riot. "This notion that somehow the violence at the Capitol on January 6 was part of some operation orchestrated by FBI sources and agents is ludicrous," FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said during a House hearing in July.
But the vast legal and evidentiary record to date has not appeared to sway people such as Travis Garcia, 34, a Republican from Rock Falls, Ill., who said, "I've read and seen a lot about these people being affiliated with the FBI." He cited a man who fits the description of Ray Epps, saying he was "trying to egg on violence before anything even happened." Epps, who became a focus of a conspiracy theory that the federal government ignited the Capitol riot, has pleaded guilty to trespassing and filed suit against Fox News for falsely depicting him as an FBI operative.
The poll results sparked dismay, but not surprise, among experts in disinformation and American media consumption.
"The finding that 25 percent believe the FBI was responsible for the Jan. 6 attack, sadly, fits in with the general nonsense and lies that are swirling around social and mainstream media," said Hany Farid, a professor at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley.
For example, a 2023 KFF poll last year found 34 percent believed the false claim that coronavirus vaccines have caused sudden deaths for thousands of healthy people, and a 2021 PRRI poll found 15 percent agreeing with a QAnon conspiracy theory that Satan-worshiping pedophiles control government, media and financial worlds.
"Whereas 20 years ago we may have argued about how or if to respond to events" such as the Capitol riot, Farid said, "today we are arguing about basic facts that are objectively and easily verifiable. ... We should all be greatly concerned for our democracy and societal stability."
Alex R. Piquero, a professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Miami and former head of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, said people self-select their news and, in doing so, self-select the facts that reinforce what they believe.
Piquero said in an interview that the legitimacy of the 2020 election, skepticism of which motivated the attack on the Capitol, had been upheld in more than 60 court cases and confirmed by countless authorities on both sides of the political aisle.
"Sometimes, for some people, no amount of data is going to change their mind," Piquero said. "If you were to ask some people, do you trust the airplane you fly in? When you go get medicine from your doctor? It comes from science and data. People are willing to be okay on some of those things that are helpful to them, but when it contradicts their worldview, that's when it gets fuzzy and unfortunate."
Debunked rhetoric about the Jan. 6 attack has not been limited to the FBI conspiracy theory. Some have alleged that anti-Trump antifa instigated the riot or that police were complicit in the breach, fueling calls for the release of Capitol surveillance footage from that day that in turn re-energized claims of FBI involvement.
Partisan divisions over Jan. 6 are clear in the poll. Almost 8 in 10 Democrats (77 percent) say that those who entered the Capitol were "mostly violent," compared with 18 percent of Republicans, down slightly from 26 percent in 2021. About 140 police officers were assaulted on Jan. 6 at the Capitol, federal authorities have said, and more than 90 people have already been sentenced for felony assaults on law enforcement caught on video, with many similar cases still pending, according to a Post database.
Partisans are also split over the punishments for those charged in the Capitol riot. The Post-UMD poll finds 42 percent of Republicans say the punishments have been "too harsh," up from 32 percent two years ago, while 60 percent of Democrats say the punishments were "not harsh enough."
Post data shows the average sentence for a Jan. 6-related felony conviction is about 41 months, with judges imposing jail or prison in 94 percent of felony cases. For defendants charged only with misdemeanors, who make up about two-thirds of the Jan. 6 cases, about half have received jail terms averaging 58 days while the other half have received probation or home detention, the Post database shows.
Overall, 50 percent of Americans say the rioters were "mostly violent," down slightly from 54 percent in a 2021 poll. "It was very, very violent," said Kathleen Lenk, 62, a Democrat from Minneapolis. "I watched the video with my own eyes, of people beating policemen, injuring people." Lenk felt the FBI was not involved in the riot but should have taken more steps to stop it based on advance warnings received by law enforcement.
Edmund Pirali, 57, a Democrat from Sykesville, Md., was discouraged by the finding that a quarter of Americans think the FBI was involved in Jan. 6. "I am so disheartened," Pirali said, "about the dissociation in America from reality and fact. And it's so pervasive." He likened the belief in FBI involvement to believing in alien body snatchers and a flat Earth.
Some of those who believe in the FBI's involvement are very firm in their opinions. "I think it was all for Joe Biden," said January Vasquez, 48, of Berlin, Conn. "Because it's a conspiracy. Everything happens for a reason." She acknowledged some Trump supporters may have "crossed the line" at the Capitol, "but sometimes in life you gotta shake it up. Everybody's got a price tag. Somebody got paid to set that ... up." Vasquez said her news sources were local television stations, CBS and CNN.
Baum, of Odessa, said with the release of surveillance videos inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 to conservative news outlets, "you can clearly see there was nobody killed. Everybody that walked through the halls, peaceful. You even had Capitol Police escorting them through it. The people that said it was an insurrection, that was a joke."
QAnon follower Ashli Babbitt was killed by police, and three other rioters died in the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Multiple police officers died by suicide in the subsequent months. Surveillance video shown by media personalities such as Tucker Carlson omitted footage of violent clashes between police and Trump supporters both inside and outside the Capitol.
Asked why so many people have pleaded guilty to rioting charges if the FBI is to blame, Baum said that "the system targets you."
"It's political piracy," he said, adding: "You still have people being detained but not being charged. You better look into it. A lot of people that are being detained, they're just being held." He said video showed those who fought with police were "FBI plants" and "agitators that were being paid by Soros or his group." Baum said his sources of information were One America News, podcaster Dan Bongino, and Glenn Beck and his website the Blaze.
The U.S. attorney's office in Washington recently released a list of 18 people still detained before trial on Jan. 6 charges and said no one has been held without charges.

The big ideaBiden, Cabinet, go after Republicans seeking money from his laws President Biden's Cabinet secretaries are fanning out across America — and, notably, red states and GOP House districts — to make the case for his economic policies. 
They're also calling out Republicans who fought his proposals but now want some of the federal cash they provide.
Look for top Biden aides to keep crisscrossing the country with the dual message that the administration is trying to help middle-class and working-class Americans over the opposition of Republicans — who later turn around and want their states or districts to benefit.
On Wednesday, Biden set the tone, defending "Bidenomics" while criticizing Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama) for cheering his state getting money to develop broadband from the president's $1.2 trillion infrastructure law, which the former football coach denounced and voted against.
My colleague Maegan Vazquez noted yesterday that Biden also cited Tuberville by name hours later in a speech in Chicago as he suggested the law's billions for broadband were "bringing along some converts" from the GOP.
She quoted Tuberville spokesman Steven Stafford as saying the senator voted against the law because it "wasted" money, but "now that it is law of the land, the people of Alabama deserve their fair share. Coach is proud to advocate for this funding to go to Alabama."
The Granholm road show No offense to the president, but that wasn't the most creative version of this kind of politicking.
Jen Haberkorn of Politico took a long look at Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm delivering the double-barreled message and trying to inflict a little "political pain" on Republicans during a visit to West Columbia, S.C.
"What was notable about Granholm's stop was where it took place," Jen wrote. "She has taken her sales pitch across the South this week, venturing into the congressional districts of five House Republicans who opposed the legislation responsible for those clean energy investments."
Granholm started her four-day tour on Monday, and has visited or will go to the districts of GOP Reps. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, Joe Wilson of South Carolina, Mike Collins and Barry Loudermilk of Georgia and Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee, Jen reported.
The other traveling Cabinet members It's not all sorties into hostile territory, of course.
On Wednesday, EPA Administrator Michael Regan was in Vermont (nary a Republican in the Green Mountain State's congressional delegation). Thursday through Saturday, he planned to be in New Orleans for the three-day Essence Festival.
Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra will be in New York City on Friday, promoting measures in Biden's Inflation Reduction Act that aim to reduce health-care costs.
This week's events include joint appearances with prominent Democrats, like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Rep. Jim Clyburn (S.C.). Becerra's NYC event features Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.
But far more interesting are the trips to Republican House districts.
"In addition to Granholm's stops, White House senior advisor Mitch Landrieu will talk about high-speed internet funding in GOP Rep. Buddy Carter's district in Savannah, Ga., on Wednesday. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is going to Rep. Hal Rogers's Kentucky district to talk about infrastructure," Jen reported. Granholm and Landrieu are due in Tennessee today [Thursday], according to a list provided by the White House. 
What's this all about? None of the GOP bastions that are getting Cabinet-level visitors so far are swing districts.
McHenry won by 55 points. Wilson by 20. Collins by 30. Loudermilk by 26. Fleischmann by 38. Carter by 18. Rogers by 64.
It's unlikely, then, that the plan is to try to flip them.
But one thing this gambit does is vastly improve the prospects of news media attention, not just nationally (though Biden's comments about Tuberville got that) but locally. A Cabinet member coming to scold a local lawmaker in person? That's coverage catnip.
So if the "voted no, took the dough" play (as some Democrats call it) gets more statewide coverage (and keeping in mind that Americans trust local news more than national news, and that regional outlets reach beyond just the target district) the White House would probably call that a win.

What's happening nowSupreme Court restricts use of race in college admissions "The Supreme Court on Thursday held that admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina that relied in part on racial considerations violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, a historic ruling that will force a dramatic change in how the nation's private and public universities select their students," Robert Barnes reports.

Supreme Court strengthens protections for religious rights at work "The Supreme Court on Thursday strengthened protections for religious rights in the workplace, siding in part with a Sabbath-observant mail carrier who quit the U.S. Postal Service after he was forced to deliver packages on Sundays," Ann E. Marimow reports.
Investors charged with insider trading on deal for Trump media firm "Three investors in the blank-check firm working to take former president Trump's media company public, including a former member of the company's board, were charged with using insider information to make $22 million in illegal profits, federal prosecutors said Thursday," Drew Harwell reports.
Israeli President Herzog invited to address joint meeting of Congress "Congressional leaders have invited Israeli President Isaac Herzog to address a joint meeting of Congress when he visits the United States next month, to mark the 75th anniversary of Israel's founding," Amy B Wang reports.
Haze shrouds patches of U.S. as smoke from Canada fires drifts east "Smoke continued to spill into Midwestern and Eastern swaths of the United States on Thursday — a result of a historically bad wildfire season in Canada that continues unabated. Thick haze from those fires already fueled concerning air pollution levels in some regions this week," Ian Livingston, Victoria Bisset and Matthew Cappucci report.
Lunchtime reads from The PostTransgender care bans for Kentucky, Tennessee minors partly blocked "Both federal courts blocked parts of respective state laws that would have prevented transgender minors from receiving hormone therapy and puberty blockers, which the Kentucky court described as 'appropriate and medically necessary' in some cases. In Tennessee, the judge did not go as far as blocking a ban on surgeries for minors; in Kentucky, the case did not directly discuss surgeries," Kelsey Ables reports.
Supreme Court's ruling on online harassment outrages victims, advocates "On Wednesday, victims of that harassment and their advocates reacted with dismay at the court's 7-2 ruling, written by Justice Elena Kagan, that found that while true threats of violence aren't protected by the First Amendment, other harassing online speech is, unless prosecutors prove a defendant acted recklessly and 'disregarded a substantial risk that his communications would be viewed as threatening violence,'" Taylor Lorenz reports.
Historic Black cemetery in Bethesda can be sold, state appeals court rules "Montgomery County's housing commission can sell a Bethesda property containing a historic Black cemetery to a developer over the objections of the descendants of the dead and a group seeking to block the sale, a Maryland appeals court ruled this week," Justin Jouvenal reports.
… and beyondChinese balloon used American tech to spy on Americans "The Chinese spy balloon that floated over the U.S. early this year was loaded with American-made equipment that helped it collect photos, videos and other information, U.S. officials said, citing preliminary findings from a closely held investigation," the Wall Street Journal's Nancy A. Youssef reports.
More Democrats than Republicans are open to a third-party presidential candidate "Forty-four percent of registered voters say they are willing to consider supporting a third-party or independent presidential candidate if President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are the two major party nominees in 2024 — and the group includes more Democrats than Republicans," NBC News's Ben Kamisar reports.
Kennedy, condemning 'censorship,' hits Democrats and courts the disaffected "Censorship, and specifically disdain for attempts to regulate the flow of disinformation and hate speech, is also a motivating factor for his powerful backers in Silicon Valley. Tech executives and investors have amplified [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s] anti-establishment message and celebrated his willingness to challenge liberal orthodoxies and scientific consensus — never mind that in doing so, he has often spread widely discredited claims about vaccines and other public health measures," the New York Times's Rebecca Davis O'Brien reports.
The Biden agendaBiden administration plans 'safety net' for student borrowers as payments resume "Biden administration officials are devising plans to ease the sting of requiring tens of millions of Americans to resume paying their student loans this fall for the first time in more than three years," Politico's Michael Stratford reports.
"The Education Department in recent weeks finalized a three-month grace period for missed payments once student loans come due in October and directed loan services to be 'prepared' to extend that flexibility for subsequent 90-day periods, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Once interest accrual resumes on Sept. 1, under the department's current plans, it would continue to pile up even if borrowers miss payments."
Biden faces key test as end of fundraising quarter looms "President Joe Biden is racing to boost his campaign war chest as the end of the fundraising quarter approaches Friday, marking the first major test of his campaign's ability to generate the cash and enthusiasm needed to compete against Republicans in 2024," CNN's Arlette Saenz, Kevin Liptak, Betsy Klein and Jasmine Wright report.
"In the closing days of the quarter, the campaign is ramping up its push for grassroots donors, including enlisting former President Barack Obama to tape a video with Biden to help drive small-dollar donations, CNN has learned, along with hosting a slew of down-to-the-wire, high-dollar fundraisers."
How state affirmative action bans affect students, visualized "A Washington Post review of 30 years of race and ethnicity data from the eight states that currently ban race-based admission policies in higher education shows how a federal ban on affirmative action might harm minority students across the United States," Janice Kai Chen and Daniel Wolfe report.
Hot on the leftDemocrats to use $20 million equal rights push to aid 2024 N.Y. House bids "New York Democrats on Thursday will announce support for a statewide effort to pass a women's rights amendment that they hope will also supercharge turnout in 2024, when President Biden and House members will be up for re-election," the NYT's Dana Rubinstein reports.
"Their strategy: Get Democrats to the polls by focusing attention on a 2024 statewide referendum, the New York Equal Rights Amendment, that will explicitly bar New York from using its power and resources to penalize those who have abortions."
Hot on the rightRFK Jr. is surging only in polls among Republicans "In April, Kennedy's net favorability (the percent who view him favorably minus those who don't) was at plus-20 overall and slightly lower among both Democrats and Republicans. By June, though, net favorability among Republicans had jumped to plus-29, while it had fallen to plus-7 among Democrats," national columnist Philip Bump explains.
"Kennedy gets more support against Biden from independents than he does from Democrats. In the most recent YouGov poll, Biden leads him by 63 points with members of the Democratic Party but by only 42 points with independents. Unfortunately for Kennedy, most Democratic primary voters are Democrats."
Today in Washington At 12:30 p.m., Biden will deliver remarks from the White House on the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action.
At 12:45 p.m., Biden will leave the White House for Joint Base Andrews, where he will fly to New York. 
Biden will sit for an interview at 4 p.m. with Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC at 30 Rock.
At 5:30 p.m., Biden will attend a fundraiser. He will attend a second fundraiser at 7:40 p.m.
Biden will leave New York for D.C. at 9:05 p.m. He's expected back at the White House at 10:50 p.m.
In closingIn a major discovery, scientists say space-time churns like a choppy sea "The very fabric of the cosmos is constantly being roiled and rumpled all around us, according to multiple international teams of scientists that have independently found compelling evidence for long-theorized space-time waves," Joel Achenbach and Victoria Jaggard report.
"The claim that telescopes across the planet have seen signs of a 'gravitational wave background' has sent a thrill through the astrophysics community, which has been buzzing for days in anticipation of the papers that were unveiled late Wednesday. The discovery seems to affirm an astounding implication of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity that until now has been far too subtle to detect."

Full text: Welcome to The Daily 202! Tell your friends to sign up here . On this day in 1991, the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 3,000 for the first time.
The big ideaThe high stakes of Dominion v. Fox CORRECTION: An earlier version of this newsletter incorrectly said William J. Brennan Jr. served as chief justice of the Supreme Court. He was an associate justice. This version has been corrected.
Get ready to hear a lot about what it means for a news outlet to act with "actual malice."
The voting machine company Dominion's defamation case against Fox News formally goes before 12 Delawareans this week, raising prospects of a verdict and almost certain appeal with potentially far-reaching effects on the news media and America's struggles with disinformation.
That's barring a last-minute deal. My colleagues Rosalind S. Helderman, Sarah Ellison and Jeremy Barr reported today that the trial's start was pushed from Monday to Tuesday "to allow both parties to hold conversations about the possibility of a settlement, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation."
But if those efforts founder, the jurors will decide whether Fox's repetition of Donald Trump's lies that he was cheated out of a second term in 2020 meet a standard the Supreme Court set in its unanimous 1964 ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan . That standard is whether Fox acted with "actual malice."
The Daily 202 is no lawyer. But in essence what the Court said is that it's not enough for a news outlet to have reported or promoted something that wasn't true about a public figure (or corporation). That news outlet must have known it was lying while it was doing so and acted with reckless disregard for the truth.
The backstory "Sullivan" was Montgomery, Ala., Public Safety Commissioner L.B. Sullivan , who sued the Times for libel over inaccuracies in an ad brought by supporters of Martin Luther King, Jr. that criticized the police in that city. He won a $500,000 judgment in lower courts.
The Times prevailed at the Supreme Court, where Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote the 9-0 decision.
"[D]ebate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide‐open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials," Brennan wrote.
The standard for libel of a public figure, he said, ought to be whether a news outlet published something "with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."
A high bar That standard makes it very hard for public figures in America to win libel cases , a point my colleagues Elahe Izadi, Jeremy Barr and Sarah Ellison made clear in their excellent curtain-raiser on the Dominion versus Fox trial, in which the voting systems company seeks $1.6 billion.
"At its core, the trial will test the limits of libel law and whether Fox News can be held legally accountable for airing false election fraud claims about Dominion Voting Systems in the wake of Donald Trump's 2020 loss. Dominion will focus on 20 statements about the voting technology company made by either attorneys associated with Trump — Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell — or by Fox hosts Maria Bartiromo , Jeanine Pirro and Lou Dobbs ," they reported.
"Some observers also view the trial, which is expected to last up to six weeks, as a symbolic referendum on the truth-challenged 'alternative facts' culture that defined the Trump presidency. 'It appears that disinformation is on trial,' said Jonathan Peters, a media law professor at the University of Georgia," my colleagues wrote.
There's another element.
"All along, Fox has denied Dominion's allegations and publicly argued that the case has put the rights of a free press on the line. 'Dominion's lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights,' the network said in a statement," my colleagues reported.
Libel law revisited? At the New York Times , Jeremy Peters noted some conservatives "see an opportunity for the Supreme Court to eventually take the case as a vehicle to revisit libel law and the 'actual malice' standard. "
"The justices have not done that since a 1989 case involving a losing candidate for municipal office in Ohio who successfully sued a newspaper after it published a false story about him a week before the election. The court said that a public figure cannot recover damages unless there was 'clear and convincing proof' of actual malice," he said.
"Some scholars," Jeremy wrote, "as well as two conservative Supreme Court justices, Neil M. Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas — have argued that 'actual malice' should be reconsidered as too high a standard. Justice Thomas specifically cited as a reason 'the proliferation of falsehoods.'"
Be careful what you wish for But, if that's the case, it shows the potential dangers for conservative media of loosening restrictions on libel findings : Fox has a fighting chance here specifically because of the "actual malice" standard. That's a lesson Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is also learning as he pushes legislation to water down news-media protections.
Trump, who made tens of thousands of false or misleading claims in office, promised on the 2016 campaign trail to "open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money."
At a 2018 Cabinet meeting, Trump said: "You can't say things that are false — knowingly false — and be able to smile as money pours into your bank account."
He might make an interesting witness when things get going in Delaware.

What's happening nowSpaceX scrubs Starship test launch after valve freezes "The decision to scrub the launch came just minutes before launch when a valve froze. A new effort won't come for at least 48 hours , SpaceX said," Christian Davenport reports.
"The test would have been the first test for SpaceX's Super Heavy rocket and Starship spacecraft together, an endeavor that, if successful, would make it the most powerful rocket in the world and could remake space exploration in coming years. "
Judge denies Trump's request for delay in trial involving rape allegation " A federal judge on Monday denied a bid by Donald Trump to delay a civil trial involving a rape allegation by author E. Jean Carroll against the former president , rejecting a contention that a 'cooling off' period is needed after Trump's arraignment this month in a criminal case related to hush money payments to an adult-film star," John Wagner and Shayna Jacobs report.
Fewer electric vehicles qualify for federal tax credits under new rules "Fewer electric vehicles now qualify for consumer tax credits after the Biden administration on Monday began enforcing tougher rules on where vehicle batteries must originate ," Jeanne Whalen reports.
Lunchtime reads from The PostRussians boasted that just 1% of fake social profiles are caught, leak shows " The Russian government has become far more successful at manipulating social media and search engine rankings than previously known , boosting lies about Ukraine's military and the side effects of vaccines with hundreds of thousands of fake online accounts, according to documents recently leaked on the chat app Discord," Joseph Menn reports.
Water cuts could save the Colorado River. Farmers are in the crosshairs. " Alex Jack has spared little expense in the quest to grow vegetables in the desert with less water," Joshua Partlow reports.
"It has cost him $2.5 million over the years to be on the cutting edge of efficiency, installing underground irrigation under alfalfa and lettuce beds, building aerated reservoirs and a network of pipes and pumps to recycle runoff. But his 3,500-acre farm still guzzles more of the Colorado River each year than some midsize cities ."
"Now, as the Biden administration moves closer to imposing unprecedented cuts in how much water states can pull from the river, Jack and other commercial farmers in the sun-scorched flatlands of the Imperial Valley are in the crosshairs of those reductions ."
Clarence Thomas has for years claimed income from a defunct real estate firm "Over the last two decades, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has reported on required financial disclosure forms that his family received rental income totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars from a firm called Ginger, Ltd., Partnership," Shawn Boburg and Emma Brown report.
" But that company — a Nebraska real estate firm launched in the 1980s by his wife and her relatives — has not existed since 2006 ."
… and beyondClarence Thomas to amend financial disclosure forms to reflect sale to GOP megadonor " Justice Clarence Thomas intends to amend his financial disclosure forms to reflect a 2014 real estate deal he made with a GOP megadonor — an acknowledgment that the transaction should have been disclosed almost a decade ago , a source close to Thomas tells CNN," CNN 's Ariane de Vogue reports.
"The deal between Thomas and Harlan Crow , a Dallas real estate magnate and long-time friend of Thomas, involves the sale of three Georgia properties, including the home where Thomas' mother, Leola Williams, 94, currently lives ."
Social-media account overseen by former Navy noncommissioned officer helped spread secrets "A social-media account overseen by a former U.S. Navy noncommissioned officer—a prominent online voice supporting Russia's war on Ukraine— played a key role in the spread of intelligence documents allegedly leaked by Airman First Class Jack Teixeira ," Yaroslav Trofimov and Bob Mackin report for the Wall Street Journal .
"A purported Russian blogger known as Donbass Devushka, which translates as Donbas Girl, reposted the files from obscure online chat rooms. The blog is the face of a network of pro-Kremlin social-media, podcasting, merchandise and fundraising accounts. But the person who hosted podcasts as Donbass Devushka and oversees these accounts is a Washington-state-based former U.S. enlisted aviation electronics technician whose real name is Sarah Bils ."
The latest on covidCovid is still a leading cause of death as the virus recedes " Federal health officials say that covid remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States , tied to about 250 deaths daily, on average, mostly among the old and immunocompromised," Dan Diamond reports.
The Biden agendaPentagon sounds alarm over Biden plan for offshore wind sites " The Pentagon is sounding alarms over Biden administration plans to advance offshore wind projects along the central Atlantic US coast , warning that almost all of the new terrain eyed for development conflicts with military operations," Bloomberg News 's Jennifer A Dlouhy reports.
" Maps shared with industry stakeholders and seen by Bloomberg News show vast red areas that the Navy and Air Force have deemed 'highly problematic,' covering prime real estate the Interior Department last year earmarked for leasing off the coasts of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Delaware."
Biden adviser resigns to prepare for House bid in Rhode Island " Gabe Amo, a special assistant to President Biden, resigned from the White House last week to prepare a campaign for the congressional seat held by retiring Rep.

Hot on the leftSome Democrats worry crackdown on TikTok could hurt party " Democrats have so successfully cultivated TikTok clout and the soapbox it provides for young voters — in contrast to Republicans' far less enthusiastic embrace — that party operatives are now drawing up detailed plans to dramatically expand its use in the 2024 campaign," Meryl Kornfield reports.
" But that strategy is colliding head-on with the Biden administration's push to crack down on TikTok . Fearing that the app's Chinese ownership could pose a security threat, the administration, through a powerful interagency committee, is pushing a plan that would require TikTok's Chinese owners to divest from the popular video app."

" The former president's 58-minute speech came after two days of other Republicans obliquely critiquing Trump's focus on the 2020 election and calling for the GOP to move on from his polarizing presidency, as well as some private fretting among party donors about the myriad investigations that engulf Trump and his nascent campaign."

Full text: Episode illustrates how vaccine misinformation can rapidly take hold
On Tuesday morning, a Fox News contributor claimed on Twitter that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was set to mandate that schoolchildren get coronavirus vaccines. By Tuesday evening, the claim was being repeated by the nation's most popular cable news show, and had been amplified to millions more on social media.
"The CDC is about to add the Covid vaccine to the childhood immunization schedule, which would make the vax mandatory for kids to attend school," host Tucker Carlson tweeted, sharing a segment from his show that has been viewed more than 1.5 million times online.
But the claim was wrong: The CDC cannot mandate that schoolchildren receive vaccines, a decision left up to states and jurisdictions, the agency and multiple public health officials said. The initial tweet by Nicole Saphier, a radiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, also misconstrued a planned meeting of CDC advisers, who voted Wednesday to add coronavirus vaccines to the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC), a safety-net program that offers the shots at no cost. A separate meeting set for Thursday would address the agency's immunization schedule for children.
Public health experts said there is a legitimate debate over whether schoolchildren should be required to be vaccinated against the coronavirus - but the incendiary and erroneous claim by the Fox News personalities is the latest example of how critics can twist the facts about the CDC and the coronavirus, potentially contributing to lower vaccination rates, fading trust in federal health officials and other consequences for public health.
"This is an all new level of dangerous misinformation," Jerome M. Adams, who served as U.S. surgeon general during the Trump administration and as Indiana's top health official, wrote in a text message to The Washington Post. "It could both harm kids (by derailing the VFC program, which helps disadvantaged children access vaccines) and endanger health officials (due to angry misinformed parents). We need to be able to have honest conversations about pros and cons of vaccinating children, without resorting to blatant misinformation."
The episode also illustrates how health-care misinformation can rapidly take hold, particularly around the coronavirus vaccine and fueled by many Americans' frustrations and confusion with pandemic policies. But public health experts often feel stymied in their response, uncertain when to engage with false claims spreading virally. And when officials do weigh in, they are often constrained by their more deliberate, sometimes bureaucratic processes.
While some outspoken individuals, like Kavita Patel, a physician and former Obama administration official, took to Twitter on Tuesday evening to criticize the false claims and rebut them point-by-point, federal officials have been more muted in their response. In interviews Tuesday evening, several administration officials said they had no plans to engage with the false claims, worried about amplifying them. But by Wednesday morning, the administration's calculation had changed, following Carlson's segment, amid mounting outrage toward federal health officials as vaccine critics seized on the wrongly reported claim that the CDC was set to mandate the shots for schoolchildren.
"Thanks to @GovRonDeSantis, COVID mandates are NOT allowed in FL, NOT pushed into schools, & I continue to recommend against them for healthy kids," Joseph Ladapo, Florida's surgeon general, wrote on Twitter.
The CDC took to Twitter around noon Wednesday, quoting Carlson's tweet and noting that its independent vaccine advisory committee would vote Thursday "on an updated childhood immunization schedule." The tweet also said: "States establish vaccine requirements for schoolchildren, not ACIP or CDC," and linked to a page that explains state vaccine requirements.
The CDC's response drew criticism from public health experts, who said the agency did not explicitly rebuff Carlson's claim or speak in plain language. Two administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly said they were uncomfortable that the CDC - by quoting Carlson's tweet - had inadvertently amplified the falsehoods in his video.
Meanwhile, Saphier's original tweet was still posted Wednesday evening and had been retweeted more than 2,400 times as of 6 p.m. Asked about Saphier's tweet, Fox News pointed to a second tweet she sent, more than nine hours later, that offered context that states did not always follow CDC recommendations. That tweet had been retweeted 55 times. Saphier also appeared in a Fox News segment Wednesday afternoon, clarifying her comments but reiterating her criticism that the children's vaccines needed further study.
Memorial Sloan Kettering said Saphier did not speak for the institution.
In a statement Wednesday, the CDC said the vaccine panel will be updating its 2023 childhood and adult immunization schedules, including whether to add approved or authorized coronavirus vaccines, as guidance to health-care providers.
"It's important to note that there are no changes in COVID-19 vaccine policy, and this action would simply help streamline clinical guidance for health care providers by including all currently licensed, authorized and routinely recommended vaccines in one document," CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in an email.
The revised immunization schedules would not take effect until January 2023. Early next year is also when the federal government will no longer provide the vaccines free, federal health officials said. The practical impact of including vaccines on the CDC's recommended immunization list means they are typically covered by insurance.
The updated schedule also "is the one place everyone can look to see exactly what all the recommendations are for all vaccines for all ages," said James Campbell, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases, who said the color-coded document is an essential tool for busy clinicians.
Public health experts noted that recommendations issued by CDC's advisory panel do not necessarily translate to state-level mandates. For instance, few states have adopted the panel's 2006 recommendation that adolescents be vaccinated against human papillomavirus, or HPV.
The CDC "has wanted to stay away" from vaccination mandates and consistently defers to local officials, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University associate professor who specializes in vaccine policy.
Polling has found a significant partisan split in perceptions of the CDC and other agencies. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats say they rate officials at the CDC and other public health agencies positively, versus just one-third of Republicans who do so, according to a Pew Research poll conducted in September.
Health care leaders also said the episode underscored the challenge of informing the public about contentious public health issues. Drew Altman, head of the nonpartisan think tank Kaiser Family Foundation, said his organization was focusing on combating health care misinformation "as our next big thing."
"It just isn't enough for us to be in the business of putting out good information. We have to now also be in the business of countering misinformation and deliberate disinformation as well," Altman said.

Full text: Judge Kathaleen McCormick granted the social media giant’s request for an expedited hearing. Now, the two sides are gearing up for a trial in October.
Twitter suit takes the fast lane
Twitter won its effort to expedite its trial with Elon Musk yesterday, in its lawsuit to force Musk to close his $44 billion acquisition of the company. So many people tried to listen to the proceedings that the dial-in hit capacity — and we hear advisers across Wall Street were huddled around speakerphones.
It’s a big win for Twitter. In granting an expedited hearing, Judge Kathaleen McCormick effectively repudiated the notion that the court needed to allow time for a deep dive into whether Twitter had accurately counted the number of bots on its platform. She cited the “cloud of uncertainty” that was hanging over the company the longer the case went undecided as the reason for her decision to fast-track the trial. And in what may be another good sign for Twitter, Judge McCormick said she was unsure that damages would be a sufficient remedy for the social media company, which wants Musk to buy it, not pay damages to walk away.
Please see Page 5. A centerpiece of Musk’s claims is that Twitter’s disclosures about the percentage of active users on its platform that are bots are misleading, which would have a “material adverse effect” on the company’s value. But Musk has yet to tell the court what, exactly, in Twitter’s disclosures might be false. This became an issue when Musk’s lawyer at Quinn Emanuel, Andy Rossman, took aim at Page 5 of Twitter’s annual report, which explains its bot count. But Twitter’s lawyer at Wachtell, Bill Savitt, in his rebuttal, noted that Twitter fills that page with hedges and warnings that numbers might be off. (It reads, in part: “Our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.”) Of Twitter’s disclosure, Savitt said: “This does not require a recreation of all things known to humanity.” Judge McCormick seemingly agreed.
The two sides are gearing up for a trial in October. Over the next weeks, they have to agree on schedules for depositions and discovery. And Musk will have time to prepare for another hearing before Judge McCormick that month: a defense of his whopping Tesla pay package — money that could come in handy if she forces him to buy Twitter.
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Netflix loses fewer subscribers than expected. The streaming service reported yesterday that it lost nearly 1 million subscribers in the second quarter, far fewer than it had forecast. What’s more, Netflix said some of its strategies to stem losses, like an ad-supported option for consumers and a crackdown on password sharing, would boost revenue as soon as next year.
A heroic act in an Indiana mall shooting renews the debate over gun access. In the days since a 22-year-old armed bystander killed a gunman two minutes into a shooting spree, the U.S. is again debating the wisdom of easier access to guns. But an analysis of 433 active shooter attacks in the U.S. between 2000 and 2021 found just 22 had ended with a bystander shooting the attacker, according to the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University.
The CHIPS Act passes a procedural hurdle in the Senate with more than 60 votes. The legislation, stalled for more than a year, gives chip manufacturers what they say is help they need to build factories in the U.S. The Senate is expected today to officially vote to pass the bill, which has been slimmed down and still needs to return to the House before it can go to the president.
Intelligence agencies say Russia remains a threat in elections. Top F.B.I. and National Security Agency officials warned yesterday that Russia could still seek to meddle or promote disinformation during the 2022 midterm races, even as it wages war in Ukraine. Iran and China also remained potent threats, the officials said.
The House moves to protect same-sex marriage from Supreme Court reversal. New legislation, which garnered some Republican support, would recognize same-sex marriages at the federal level, but it faces an uncertain path in the Senate. The move was a direct answer to Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion in the ruling last month that overturned federal abortion rights.
The loans that may haunt Silicon Valley
Tech workers have taken out loans in recent years based on the value of their start-up stock. But as the start-up economy has deflated, that may come back to haunt them, writes The Times’s Erin Griffith.
Start-up loans stem from the way workers are typically paid. As part of their compensation, most employees at privately held tech companies receive stock options. That’s where loans and other financing options come in. Start-up stock is used as a form of collateral for cash advances. The loans vary in structure, but most providers charge interest and take a percentage of the worker’s stock when the company sells or goes public. Some are structured as contracts or investments.
This lending industry has boomed in recent years. Many of the providers were created in the mid-2010s as hot start-ups like Uber and Airbnb put off initial public offerings of stock as long as they could, hitting private market valuations in the tens of billions of dollars.
Debate has ignited in Silicon Valley over the proliferation of loans backed by stakes in still-private start-ups. Proponents say the loans are necessary for employees to participate in tech’s wealth-creation engine. But critics say the loans create needless risk in an already-risky industry and are reminiscent of the dot-com era in the early 2000s, when many tech workers were badly burned by similar loans.
As the start-up economy deflates, these loans can be risky . While most are structured to be forgiven if a start-up fails, employees could still face a tax bill because the loan forgiveness is treated as taxable income.
“No one’s been thinking about what happens when things go down,” said Rick Heitzmann, an investor at FirstMark Capital. “Everyone’s only thinking about the upside.”
“The thing I’ve always been taught by my parents is to be the first one in and last one out. But there’s no one else there.”
— Alex Hyman, who pictured his internship at a Los Angeles entertainment agency this summer as being one part “Entourage” and one part “The Office,” but found it more like “Home Alone.” It’s a common experience in an age of remote-working bosses .
Mooch’s crypto problem
Anthony Scaramucci, who is famous for his 11-day stint as former President Donald Trump’s communications director, is facing a mass exodus of investors from his funds.
Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Scaramucci’s firm SkyBridge Capital had halted withdrawals from one of its smaller funds, Legion Strategies, which contains just over $200 million. But Scaramucci is also struggling to hold onto investors in SkyBridge’s flagship fund, the SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios, which managed as much as $2 billion at the end of March. Its investments lost nearly a quarter of their value in the second quarter.
Investors in SkyBridge’s flagship fund are seeking to withdraw as much as $890 million , or about half of the money that it held as of the end of last month, Scaramucci told DealBook . But many of those investors will be stuck in the fund for a while. Under its rules, investors in the Multi-Adviser fund are only allowed to withdraw money during certain windows. Those used to occur four times a year, but SkyBridge cut them to twice a year in 2020, after big losses at the beginning of the pandemic. Earlier this month, SkyBridge told investors they would only collectively receive about 16 percent of the money they requested. The letter said it was issuing investors’ notes that would be paid no later than October.
Scaramucci’s losses come just over a year after SkyBridge’s pivot into crypto. SkyBridge’s flagship fund, which Scaramucci bought from Citigroup, has long specialized in buying and selling stakes of other hedge funds. For a time, that, along with strong performance in the years after the 2008 financial crisis, made Scaramucci one of the most powerful players in the hedge fund industry.
Scaramucci says he is still a long-term believer in crypto. The fund manager says that about 22 percent of his flagship fund remained in crypto and related investments as of the end of last month. “I am not smart enough to time the market,” he told DealBook. “But we’ve done a tremendous amount of research and we think anyone who has will see that blockchain technology is good and is the future.”

Twitter suit takes the fast lane
Twitter won its effort to expedite its trial with Elon Musk yesterday, in its lawsuit to force Musk to close his $44 billion acquisition of the company. So many people tried to listen to the proceedings that the dial-in hit capacity — and we hear advisers across Wall Street were huddled around speakerphones.
It’s a big win for Twitter. In granting an expedited hearing, Judge Kathaleen McCormick effectively repudiated the notion that the court needed to allow time for a deep dive into whether Twitter had accurately counted the number of bots on its platform. She cited the “cloud of uncertainty” that was hanging over the company the longer the case went undecided as the reason for her decision to fast-track the trial. And in what may be another good sign for Twitter, Judge McCormick said she was unsure that damages would be a sufficient remedy for the social media company, which wants Musk to buy it, not pay damages to walk away.
Please see Page 5. A centerpiece of Musk’s claims is that Twitter’s disclosures about the percentage of active users on its platform that are bots are misleading, which would have a “material adverse effect” on the company’s value. But Musk has yet to tell the court what, exactly, in Twitter’s disclosures might be false. This became an issue when Musk’s lawyer at Quinn Emanuel, Andy Rossman, took aim at Page 5 of Twitter’s annual report, which explains its bot count. But Twitter’s lawyer at Wachtell, Bill Savitt, in his rebuttal, noted that Twitter fills that page with hedges and warnings that numbers might be off. (It reads, in part: “Our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.”) Of Twitter’s disclosure, Savitt said: “This does not require a recreation of all things known to humanity.” Judge McCormick seemingly agreed.
The two sides are gearing up for a trial in October. Over the next weeks, they have to agree on schedules for depositions and discovery. And Musk will have time to prepare for another hearing before Judge McCormick that month: a defense of his whopping Tesla pay package — money that could come in handy if she forces him to buy Twitter.
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING
Netflix loses fewer subscribers than expected. The streaming service reported yesterday that it lost nearly 1 million subscribers in the second quarter, far fewer than it had forecast. What’s more, Netflix said some of its strategies to stem losses, like an ad-supported option for consumers and a crackdown on password sharing, would boost revenue as soon as next year.
A heroic act in an Indiana mall shooting renews the debate over gun access. In the days since a 22-year-old armed bystander killed a gunman two minutes into a shooting spree, the U.S. is again debating the wisdom of easier access to guns. But an analysis of 433 active shooter attacks in the U.S. between 2000 and 2021 found just 22 had ended with a bystander shooting the attacker, according to the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University.
The CHIPS Act passes a procedural hurdle in the Senate with more than 60 votes. The legislation, stalled for more than a year, gives chip manufacturers what they say is help they need to build factories in the U.S. The Senate is expected today to officially vote to pass the bill, which has been slimmed down and still needs to return to the House before it can go to the president.
Intelligence agencies say Russia remains a threat in elections. Top F.B.I. and National Security Agency officials warned yesterday that Russia could still seek to meddle or promote disinformation during the 2022 midterm races, even as it wages war in Ukraine. Iran and China also remained potent threats, the officials said.
The House moves to protect same-sex marriage from Supreme Court reversal. New legislation, which garnered some Republican support, would recognize same-sex marriages at the federal level, but it faces an uncertain path in the Senate. The move was a direct answer to Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion in the ruling last month that overturned federal abortion rights.
The loans that may haunt Silicon Valley
Tech workers have taken out loans in recent years based on the value of their start-up stock. But as the start-up economy has deflated, that may come back to haunt them, writes The Times’s Erin Griffith.
Start-up loans stem from the way workers are typically paid. As part of their compensation, most employees at privately held tech companies receive stock options. That’s where loans and other financing options come in. Start-up stock is used as a form of collateral for cash advances. The loans vary in structure, but most providers charge interest and take a percentage of the worker’s stock when the company sells or goes public. Some are structured as contracts or investments.
This lending industry has boomed in recent years. Many of the providers were created in the mid-2010s as hot start-ups like Uber and Airbnb put off initial public offerings of stock as long as they could, hitting private market valuations in the tens of billions of dollars.
Debate has ignited in Silicon Valley over the proliferation of loans backed by stakes in still-private start-ups. Proponents say the loans are necessary for employees to participate in tech’s wealth-creation engine. But critics say the loans create needless risk in an already-risky industry and are reminiscent of the dot-com era in the early 2000s, when many tech workers were badly burned by similar loans.
As the start-up economy deflates, these loans can be risky . While most are structured to be forgiven if a start-up fails, employees could still face a tax bill because the loan forgiveness is treated as taxable income.
“No one’s been thinking about what happens when things go down,” said Rick Heitzmann, an investor at FirstMark Capital. “Everyone’s only thinking about the upside.”
“The thing I’ve always been taught by my parents is to be the first one in and last one out. But there’s no one else there.”
— Alex Hyman, who pictured his internship at a Los Angeles entertainment agency this summer as being one part “Entourage” and one part “The Office,” but found it more like “Home Alone.” It’s a common experience in an age of remote-working bosses .
Mooch’s crypto problem
Anthony Scaramucci, who is famous for his 11-day stint as former President Donald Trump’s communications director, is facing a mass exodus of investors from his funds.
Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Scaramucci’s firm SkyBridge Capital had halted withdrawals from one of its smaller funds, Legion Strategies, which contains just over $200 million. But Scaramucci is also struggling to hold onto investors in SkyBridge’s flagship fund, the SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios, which managed as much as $2 billion at the end of March. Its investments lost nearly a quarter of their value in the second quarter.
Investors in SkyBridge’s flagship fund are seeking to withdraw as much as $890 million , or about half of the money that it held as of the end of last month, Scaramucci told DealBook . But many of those investors will be stuck in the fund for a while. Under its rules, investors in the Multi-Adviser fund are only allowed to withdraw money during certain windows.

Earlier this month, SkyBridge told investors they would only collectively receive about 16 percent of the money they requested.

Routine Inoculations for Kindergartners Lagging During Pandemic, C.D.C. Says: [National Desk]

Full text: Nationwide, the number of kindergartners with the required shots fell below the target for broad immunity, raising fears of outbreaks of measles and other illnesses.
Kindergartners in the United States fell behind on routine childhood vaccinations during the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday, a slide that experts attributed to skipped checkups and to a groundswell of resistance to Covid-19 shots spilling into unease about other vaccines.
During the 2020-21 school year, about 94 percent of kindergartners had the required vaccines, a drop of roughly one percentage point from the previous school year, the C.D.C. said. That pulled coverage levels below the target of 95 percent, raising fears that life-threatening childhood illnesses like measles could at some point become more prevalent.
"This means there are 35,000 more children in the United States during this time period without documentation of complete vaccination against common diseases," Dr. Georgina Peacock, the acting director of the C.D.C.'s immunization services division, said at a news conference on Thursday. "This is further evidence of how pandemic-related disruptions to education and health care could have lingering consequences for children."
Enrollment in kindergarten had also fallen by around 10 percent, Dr. Peacock said, meaning that about 400,000 additional children who had been expected to start school but did not may also have fallen behind on routine vaccinations.
Some states showed dramatic declines in coverage, while others held steadier. Maryland, for instance, reported a roughly 10 percent drop in coverage with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine from the 2019-20 school year to 2020-21 among kindergartners. Wisconsin, Georgia, Wyoming and Kentucky all reported declines of around 5 percent.
Idaho had among the lowest levels of coverage during the 2020-21 school year with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, at 86.5 percent.
The C.D.C. said that coverage had fallen in a majority of states. Virginia, Kansas and Alabama were among a small number of states reporting higher levels of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine coverage during the last school year.
C.D.C. scientists emphasized that extra barriers to reporting vaccination data during the pandemic, including reduced staffing and difficulties collecting information from parents, could also have artificially lowered recorded coverage levels in some places.
Nationally, vaccination coverage fell slightly below 94 percent for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine; the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine; and for the varicella vaccine, the C.D.C. said. The United States had already very nearly lost its status as a country that had eliminated measles in 2019. During that year, the country experienced an unusually high number of measles outbreaks in communities where vaccination levels had dropped.
C.D.C. scientists ascribed the coverage declines in part to missed well-child checkups, which pediatricians said that some families were avoiding during the pandemic out of fear of coming into contact with children with Covid. The agency said that disruptions to schooling, including eased immunization requirements for remote learners and heavy demands on school nurses, could also have contributed to reduced vaccinations.
Pediatricians said in interviews that those issues had also collided with growing levels of anti-vaccine misinformation aimed at the coronavirus shots, which they said had prompted more resistance to ordinary vaccines, too.
"There's a greater proportion of parents who are questioning routine vaccines," said Dr. Jason V. Terk, a pediatrician practicing in a suburb of Dallas who also acts as a spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
"The experience of the pandemic, and the agenda-driven disinformation that has been pushed out relative to Covid vaccines," he added, had "fed the fire of distrust and skepticism that is really sort of the new pandemic of hesitancy for routine vaccines."
Public health experts also noted a movement by some state legislatures to create new restrictions around requiring vaccines, though they said that many bills were still pending.
The C.D.C. study did not find evidence of a surge of families seeking exemptions during the pandemic: It said that the percentage of kindergartners with an exemption for one or more required vaccines was 2.2 percent in 2020-21, similar to the figure reported a year earlier.
The agency said that it estimated vaccination coverage based on counts provided by federally funded immunization programs that work with schools and local education departments to examine students' vaccination and exemption status. It noted that the pandemic had sometimes interfered with efforts to collect and report vaccination data and that national coverage estimates for 2020-21 included only 47 of 50 states and Washington, D.C.
Signs of declining childhood immunization rates had emerged earlier in the pandemic, including reduced vaccine orders from states as part of a federally funded program for uninsured patients.
Dr. Gary Kirkilas, a pediatrician in Phoenix who cares for patients whose families are often poor or homeless, said that conversations about vaccines with the families of children entering kindergarten are often straightforward. After all, he said, the shots needed at that age are often effectively booster doses of vaccines that were administered at younger ages.
But he said that vaccinating children in families that were transient, unused to seeing doctors regularly or distrustful of the medical community required a special level of attention. Skipped well-child checkups during the pandemic exacerbated those problems, Dr. Kirkilas said.
And while one segment of families arrived eager for their children to get vaccines to protect against Covid and other diseases, another was more resistant than ever.
"All the rumblings about vaccines for kids and the misinformation that was going on at the time -- that sort of amplified that particular segment of families, where 'I'm distrustful of the flu vaccine and then I'm also distrustful of the Covid vaccine and maybe I'm starting to be distrustful of vaccines in general,"' he said.
C.D.C. scientists said they were hopeful that the return of in-person schooling would accelerate efforts to catch children up on routine vaccines. They encouraged schools to send reminders to families whose children were behind and said doctors' offices should alert families that children were due for additional shots.

Kindergartners in the United States fell behind on routine childhood vaccinations during the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday, a slide that experts attributed to skipped checkups and to a groundswell of resistance to COVID-19 shots spilling into unease about other vaccines.

The agency said that it estimated vaccination coverage based on counts provided by federally funded immunization programs that work with schools and local education departments to examine students’ vaccination and exemption status. It noted that the pandemic had sometimes interfered with efforts to collect and report vaccination data and that national coverage estimates for 2020-21 included only 47 of 50 states and Washington, D.C.
Signs of declining childhood immunization rates had emerged earlier in the pandemic, including reduced vaccine orders from states as part of a federally funded program for uninsured patients.
Dr. Gary Kirkilas, a pediatrician in Phoenix who cares for patients whose families are often poor or homeless, said that conversations about vaccines with the families of children entering kindergarten are often straightforward. After all, he said, the shots needed at that age are often effectively booster doses of vaccines that were administered at younger ages.
But he said that vaccinating children in families that were transient, unused to seeing doctors regularly or distrustful of the medical community required a special level of attention. Skipped well-child checkups during the pandemic exacerbated those problems, Kirkilas said.
And while one segment of families arrived eager for their children to get vaccines to protect against COVID-19 and other diseases, another was more resistant than ever.
“All the rumblings about vaccines for kids and the misinformation that was going on at the time — that sort of amplified that particular segment of families, where ‘I’m distrustful of the flu vaccine and then I’m also distrustful of the COVID vaccine and maybe I’m starting to be distrustful of vaccines in general,’” he said.
CDC scientists said they were hopeful that the return of in-person schooling would accelerate efforts to catch children up on routine vaccines. They encouraged schools to send reminders to families whose children were behind and said doctors’ offices should alert families that children were due for additional shots.

Full text: Nationwide, the number of kindergartners with the required shots fell below the target for broad immunity, raising fears of outbreaks of measles and other illnesses.
Kindergartners in the United States fell behind on routine childhood vaccinations during the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday, a slide that experts attributed to skipped checkups and to a groundswell of resistance to Covid-19 shots spilling into unease about other vaccines.
During the 2020-21 school year, about 94 percent of kindergartners had the required vaccines, a drop of roughly one percentage point from the previous school year, the C.D.C. said. That pulled coverage levels below the target of 95 percent, raising fears that life-threatening childhood illnesses like measles could at some point become more prevalent.
“This means there are 35,000 more children in the United States during this time period without documentation of complete vaccination against common diseases,” Dr. Georgina Peacock, the acting director of the C.D.C.’s immunization services division, said at a news conference on Thursday. “This is further evidence of how pandemic-related disruptions to education and health care could have lingering consequences for children.”
Enrollment in kindergarten had also fallen by around 10 percent, Dr. Peacock said, meaning that about 400,000 additional children who had been expected to start school but did not may also have fallen behind on routine vaccinations.
Some states showed dramatic declines in coverage, while others held steadier. Maryland, for instance, reported a roughly 10 percent drop in coverage with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine from the 2019-20 school year to 2020-21 among kindergartners. Wisconsin, Georgia, Wyoming and Kentucky all reported declines of around 5 percent.
Idaho had among the lowest levels of coverage during the 2020-21 school year with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, at 86.5 percent.
The C.D.C. said that coverage had fallen in a majority of states. Virginia, Kansas and Alabama were among a small number of states reporting higher levels of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine coverage during the last school year.
C.D.C. scientists emphasized that extra barriers to reporting vaccination data during the pandemic, including reduced staffing and difficulties collecting information from parents, could also have artificially lowered recorded coverage levels in some places.
Nationally, vaccination coverage fell slightly below 94 percent for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine; the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine; and for the varicella vaccine, the C.D.C. said. The United States had already very nearly lost its status as a country that had eliminated measles in 2019. During that year, the country experienced an unusually high number of measles outbreaks in communities where vaccination levels had dropped.
C.D.C. scientists ascribed the coverage declines in part to missed well-child checkups, which pediatricians said that some families were avoiding during the pandemic out of fear of coming into contact with children with Covid. The agency said that disruptions to schooling, including eased immunization requirements for remote learners and heavy demands on school nurses, could also have contributed to reduced vaccinations.
Pediatricians said in interviews that those issues had also collided with growing levels of anti-vaccine misinformation aimed at the coronavirus shots, which they said had prompted more resistance to ordinary vaccines, too.
“There’s a greater proportion of parents who are questioning routine vaccines,” said Dr. Jason V. Terk, a pediatrician practicing in a suburb of Dallas who also acts as a spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“The experience of the pandemic, and the agenda-driven disinformation that has been pushed out relative to Covid vaccines,” he added, had “fed the fire of distrust and skepticism that is really sort of the new pandemic of hesitancy for routine vaccines.”
Public health experts also noted a movement by some state legislatures to create new restrictions around requiring vaccines, though they said that many bills were still pending.
The C.D.C. study did not find evidence of a surge of families seeking exemptions during the pandemic: It said that the percentage of kindergartners with an exemption for one or more required vaccines was 2.2 percent in 2020-21, similar to the figure reported a year earlier.

Full text: Dr. Robert Malone says he helped invent mRNA vaccines and has been wronged for decades. Now he's spreading unfounded claims about the vaccines and the virus.
MADISON, Va. -- "I haven't been able to ride a horse in months," Dr. Robert Malone said from his 50-acre horse farm about two hours southwest of Washington. "It's just a constant barrage of requests for assistance."
Dr. Malone, 62, was sitting barefoot at his kitchen table, wearing a navy tie decorated with dark red spikes of the coronavirus, in the middle of another busy day of appearances on conservative television shows and podcasts. Just that week, he had appeared on "Hannity," a hit on Fox News that averages over three million viewers, and on One America News. He joined "Candace," an online talk show hosted by the right-wing media personality Candace Owens. And he was a guest on the podcasts "America First With Sebastian Gorka" and "The Joe Pags Show."
Dr. Malone spent decades working in academic centers and with start-ups seeking to bring new medical treatments to market and to combat the Zika and Ebola outbreaks. But in recent months, as the coronavirus pandemic has persisted, he has taken up an entirely different role: spreading misinformation about the virus and vaccines on conservative programs.
In many of his appearances, Dr. Malone questions the severity of the coronavirus, which has now killed nearly one million people in the United States, and the safety of the coronavirus vaccines, which have been widely found to be safe and effective at preventing serious illness and death. His statements in late December on "The Joe Rogan Experience," one of the most popular podcasts in the country, with 11 million listeners per episode on average, were at the center of the uproar over Mr. Rogan's role in spreading bad information about the virus.
Dr. Malone also routinely sells himself on the shows as the inventor of mRNA vaccines, the technology used by Pfizer and Moderna for their Covid-19 shots, and says he doesn't get the credit he deserves for their development. While he was involved in some early research into the technology, his role in its creation was minimal at best, say half a dozen Covid experts and researchers, including three who worked closely with Dr. Malone.
In spreading these exaggerations and unfounded claims, Dr. Malone joins medical professionals and scientists, like Dr. Joseph Mercola and Dr. Judy Mikovits, whose profiles have grown during the pandemic as they spread misinformation about mask-wearing and convoluted conspiracy theories about virus experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci.
But unlike many of them, Dr. Malone is quite new to the right-wing media world, first appearing regularly on podcasts last June. Even two years into the pandemic, new misinformation stars are being minted. And in today's media echo chamber -- powered by social media algorithms and a tightknit network of politicians and influencers promoting debunked claims -- they can quickly catapult to stardom.
In addition to his regular appearances on conservative shows, Dr. Malone has more than 134,000 subscribers to his Substack newsletter. About 8,000 pay the $ 5 monthly cost, he said, which would amount to at least $ 31,200 in monthly revenue. And mentions of him on social media, on cable television and in print and online news outlets have soared -- to more than 300,000 so far this year, according to Zignal, a media research firm.
The coronavirus pandemic has "given rise to a class of influencers who build conspiracy theories and recruit as many people into them as possible," said Emerson T. Brooking, a resident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council who studies digital platforms. "These influencers usually have a special claim to expertise and a veneer of credibility."
"And almost without exception, these influencers feel that they have been wronged by mainstream society in some way," Mr. Brooking added.
Dr. Malone earned a medical degree from Northwestern University in 1991, and for the next decade taught pathology at the University of California, Davis, and the University of Maryland. He then turned to biotech start-ups and consulting. His résumé says he was "instrumental" in securing early-stage approval for research on the Ebola vaccine by the pharmaceutical company Merck in the mid-2010s. He also worked on repurposing drugs to treat Zika.
In extended interviews at his home over two days, Dr. Malone said he was repeatedly not recognized for his contributions over the course of his career, his voice low and grave as he recounted perceived slights by the institutions he had worked for. His wife, Dr. Jill Glasspool Malone, paced the room and pulled up articles on her laptop that she said supported his complaints.
The example he points to more frequently is from his time at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego. While there, he performed experiments that showed how human cells could absorb an mRNA cocktail and produce proteins from it. Those experiments, he says, make him the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology.
"I was there," Dr. Malone said. "I wrote all the invention."
What the mainstream media did instead, he said, was give credit for the mRNA vaccines to the scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, because there "is a concerted campaign to get them the Nobel Prize" by Pfizer and BioNTech, where Dr. Kariko is a senior vice president, as well as the University of Pennsylvania, where Dr. Weissman leads a laboratory researching vaccines and infectious diseases.
But at the time he was conducting those experiments, it was not known how to protect the fragile RNA from the immune system's attack, scientists say. Former colleagues said they had watched in astonishment as Dr. Malone began posting on social media about why he deserved to win the Nobel Prize.
The idea that he is the inventor of mRNA vaccines is "a totally false claim," said Dr. Gyula Acsadi, a pediatrician in Connecticut who along with Dr. Malone and five others wrote a widely cited paper in 1990 showing that injecting RNA into muscle could produce proteins. (The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work by injecting RNA into arm muscles that produce copies of the "spike protein" found on the outside of the coronavirus. The human immune system identifies that protein, attacks it and then remembers how to defeat it.)
But Dr. Malone was not the lead author on the paper and, according to Dr. Acsadi, did not make a significant contribution to the research. While the paper stated that the technology could "provide alternative approaches to vaccine development," Dr. Acsadi said none of the other authors would claim that they invented the vaccine.
"Some of his work was important," said Dr. Alastair McAlpine, a pediatric infectious disease doctor based in Vancouver, British Columbia, "but that's a long way away from claiming to have invented the technology that underpins the vaccines as we use them today."
The vaccines "are the result of hundreds of scientists all over the world, all combining to come together to form this vaccine," Dr. McAlpine said. "It was not one individual or the pioneering work of an individual person."
A spokeswoman for Penn Medicine said, "We have been excited to witness the deployment of the vaccines in the global fight against the virus and the well-deserved global recognition for Drs. Kariko and Weissman's decades of visionary basic science research."
Dr. Malone pushes back against the criticism directed at him by scientists, researchers and journalists, and dismisses the dozens of fact-checks disputing his statements as "attacks."
He also continues to repeat his claims, with the help of his wife, Dr. Glasspool Malone, who is trained in biotechnology and public policy. She writes, he said, more than half of the articles posted onto his Substack newsletter -- which is awash in conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccines. Recent articles include "The illusion of evidence-based medicine" and "How does it feel to be vindicated?"
Dr. Malone said he did not align himself with any particular political party. But in recent months, he and his wife have made numerous stops at popular conservative conferences, like Hereticon, the Peter Thiel-backed conference in Miami for Silicon Valley's self-proclaimed contrarians, and the "Defeat the Mandates" march in Washington.
Dr. Malone says much of the pushback he receives is because anything that questions the guidance from organizations like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is automatically labeled misinformation by the medical establishment, as well as the technology platforms.
Many well-meaning public figures and donors committed themselves to the wrong ideas, just to be able to tell themselves that they are indeed playing a role helping to solve the crisis, he said.
"It is really easy to get caught up in it, and obsess, and lose perspective -- and kind of lose yourself," Dr. Malone said of them.
Many scientists and researchers say there is good-faith disagreement about how to translate fast-moving science into policy, and acknowledge that health agencies have adjusted guidelines over time, as new information is collected.
Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, said such guidance was "only as reliable as the evidence behind it, and thus it should change when new evidence is obtained."
But they say Dr. Malone has twisted legitimate policy debates to use them as cover for continuing to spread misinformation and to advance claims about the pandemic that are demonstrably incorrect.
Months ago, he was promoting the drugs hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for treatment of Covid-19, despite several studies and scientific trials showing a lack of evidence that the drugs improved the conditions of Covid patients. Dr. Malone said that early on in the pandemic, he believed that what he could contribute was bringing repurposed drugs to market.
"All the big boys came in for the vaccines," Dr. Malone said. "We weren't needed for that."
The Food and Drug Administration continues to caution against the use of hydroxychloroquine "due to risk of heart rhythm problems," and a large study published in March found that ivermectin does not reduce the risk of Covid hospitalization. The F.D.A. has also said taking large doses of the drug is dangerous.
"Robert Malone is exploiting the fact that data-driven course correction is inherent to the scientific process to peddle disinformation," Dr. Rasmussen said. "It's extraordinarily dishonest and morally bankrupt."

But Malone was not the lead author on the paper and, according to Acsadi, did not make a significant contribution to the research. While the paper stated that the technology could “provide alternative approaches to vaccine development,” Acsadi said none of the other authors would claim that they invented the vaccine.
“Some of his work was important,” said Dr. Alastair McAlpine, a pediatric infectious disease doctor based in Vancouver, British Columbia, “but that’s a long way away from claiming to have invented the technology that underpins the vaccines as we use them today.”
The vaccines “are the result of hundreds of scientists all over the world, all combining to come together to form this vaccine,” McAlpine said. “It was not one individual or the pioneering work of an individual person.”
A spokeswoman for Penn Medicine said, “We have been excited to witness the deployment of the vaccines in the global fight against the virus and the well-deserved global recognition for Drs. Kariko and Weissman’s decades of visionary basic science research.”
Malone pushes back against the criticism directed at him by scientists, researchers and journalists, and dismisses the dozens of fact-checks disputing his statements as “attacks.”
He also continues to repeat his claims, with the help of his wife, who is trained in biotechnology and public policy. She writes, he said, more than half of the articles posted onto his Substack newsletter — which is awash in conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 vaccines. Recent articles include “The illusion of evidence-based medicine” and “How does it feel to be vindicated?”
Malone said he did not align himself with any particular political party. But in recent months, he and his wife have made numerous stops at popular conservative conferences, like Hereticon, the Peter Thiel-backed conference in Miami for Silicon Valley’s self-proclaimed contrarians, and the “Defeat the Mandates” march in Washington.
Malone says much of the pushback he receives is because anything that questions the guidance from organizations like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is automatically labeled misinformation by the medical establishment, as well as the technology platforms.
Many well-meaning public figures and donors committed themselves to the wrong ideas, just to be able to tell themselves that they are indeed playing a role helping to solve the crisis, he said.
“It is really easy to get caught up in it, and obsess, and lose perspective — and kind of lose yourself,” Malone said of them.
Many scientists and researchers say there is good-faith disagreement about how to translate fast-moving science into policy, and acknowledge that health agencies have adjusted guidelines over time, as new information is collected.
Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, said such guidance was “only as reliable as the evidence behind it, and thus it should change when new evidence is obtained.”
But they say Malone has twisted legitimate policy debates to use them as cover for continuing to spread misinformation and to advance claims about the pandemic that are demonstrably incorrect.
Months ago, he was promoting the drugs hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin for treatment of COVID-19, despite several studies and scientific trials showing a lack of evidence that the drugs improved the conditions of COVID patients. Malone said that early on in the pandemic, he believed that what he could contribute was bringing repurposed drugs to market.
“All the big boys came in for the vaccines,” Malone said. “We weren’t needed for that.”
The Food and Drug Administration continues to caution against the use of hydroxychloroquine “due to risk of heart rhythm problems,” and a large study published in March found that ivermectin does not reduce the risk of COVID hospitalization. The FDA has also said taking large doses of the drug is dangerous.
“Robert Malone is exploiting the fact that data-driven course correction is inherent to the scientific process to peddle disinformation,” Rasmussen said. “It’s extraordinarily dishonest and morally bankrupt.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Dr. Robert Malone says he helped invent mRNA vaccines and has been wronged for decades. Now he’s spreading unfounded claims about the vaccines and the virus.
MADISON, Va. — “I haven’t been able to ride a horse in months,” Dr. Robert Malone said from his 50-acre horse farm about two hours southwest of Washington. “It’s just a constant barrage of requests for assistance.”
Dr. Malone, 62, was sitting barefoot at his kitchen table, wearing a navy tie decorated with dark red spikes of the coronavirus, in the middle of another busy day of appearances on conservative television shows and podcasts. Just that week, he had appeared on “Hannity,” a hit on Fox News that averages over three million viewers, and on One America News. He joined “Candace,” an online talk show hosted by the right-wing media personality Candace Owens. And he was a guest on the podcasts “America First With Sebastian Gorka” and “The Joe Pags Show.”
Dr. Malone spent decades working in academic centers and with start-ups seeking to bring new medical treatments to market and to combat the Zika and Ebola outbreaks. But in recent months, as the coronavirus pandemic has persisted, he has taken up an entirely different role: spreading misinformation about the virus and vaccines on conservative programs.
In many of his appearances, Dr. Malone questions the severity of the coronavirus, which has now killed nearly one million people in the United States, and the safety of the coronavirus vaccines, which have been widely found to be safe and effective at preventing serious illness and death. His statements in late December on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” one of the most popular podcasts in the country, with 11 million listeners per episode on average, were at the center of the uproar over Mr. Rogan’s role in spreading bad information about the virus.
Dr. Malone also routinely sells himself on the shows as the inventor of mRNA vaccines, the technology used by Pfizer and Moderna for their Covid-19 shots, and says he doesn’t get the credit he deserves for their development. While he was involved in some early research into the technology, his role in its creation was minimal at best, say half a dozen Covid experts and researchers, including three who worked closely with Dr. Malone.
In spreading these exaggerations and unfounded claims, Dr. Malone joins medical professionals and scientists, like Dr. Joseph Mercola and Dr. Judy Mikovits, whose profiles have grown during the pandemic as they spread misinformation about mask-wearing and convoluted conspiracy theories about virus experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci.
But unlike many of them, Dr. Malone is quite new to the right-wing media world, first appearing regularly on podcasts last June. Even two years into the pandemic, new misinformation stars are being minted. And in today’s media echo chamber — powered by social media algorithms and a tightknit network of politicians and influencers promoting debunked claims — they can quickly catapult to stardom.
In addition to his regular appearances on conservative shows, Dr. Malone has more than 134,000 subscribers to his Substack newsletter. About 8,000 pay the $5 monthly cost, he said, which would amount to at least $31,200 in monthly revenue. And mentions of him on social media, on cable television and in print and online news outlets have soared — to more than 300,000 so far this year, according to Zignal, a media research firm.
The coronavirus pandemic has “given rise to a class of influencers who build conspiracy theories and recruit as many people into them as possible,” said Emerson T. Brooking, a resident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council who studies digital platforms. “These influencers usually have a special claim to expertise and a veneer of credibility.”
“And almost without exception, these influencers feel that they have been wronged by mainstream society in some way,” Mr. Brooking added.
Dr. Malone earned a medical degree from Northwestern University in 1991, and for the next decade taught pathology at the University of California, Davis, and the University of Maryland. He then turned to biotech start-ups and consulting. His résumé says he was “instrumental” in securing early-stage approval for research on the Ebola vaccine by the pharmaceutical company Merck in the mid-2010s. He also worked on repurposing drugs to treat Zika.
In extended interviews at his home over two days, Dr. Malone said he was repeatedly not recognized for his contributions over the course of his career, his voice low and grave as he recounted perceived slights by the institutions he had worked for. His wife, Dr. Jill Glasspool Malone, paced the room and pulled up articles on her laptop that she said supported his complaints.
The example he points to more frequently is from his time at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego. While there, he performed experiments that showed how human cells could absorb an mRNA cocktail and produce proteins from it. Those experiments, he says, make him the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology.
“I was there,” Dr. Malone said. “I wrote all the invention.”
What the mainstream media did instead, he said, was give credit for the mRNA vaccines to the scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, because there “is a concerted campaign to get them the Nobel Prize” by Pfizer and BioNTech, where Dr. Kariko is a senior vice president, as well as the University of Pennsylvania, where Dr. Weissman leads a laboratory researching vaccines and infectious diseases.
But at the time he was conducting those experiments, it was not known how to protect the fragile RNA from the immune system’s attack, scientists say. Former colleagues said they had watched in astonishment as Dr. Malone began posting on social media about why he deserved to win the Nobel Prize.
The idea that he is the inventor of mRNA vaccines is “a totally false claim,” said Dr. Gyula Acsadi, a pediatrician in Connecticut who along with Dr. Malone and five others wrote a widely cited paper in 1990 showing that injecting RNA into muscle could produce proteins. (The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work by injecting RNA into arm muscles that produce copies of the “spike protein” found on the outside of the coronavirus. The human immune system identifies that protein, attacks it and then remembers how to defeat it.)
But Dr. Malone was not the lead author on the paper and, according to Dr. Acsadi, did not make a significant contribution to the research. While the paper stated that the technology could “provide alternative approaches to vaccine development,” Dr. Acsadi said none of the other authors would claim that they invented the vaccine.
“Some of his work was important,” said Dr. Alastair McAlpine, a pediatric infectious disease doctor based in Vancouver, British Columbia, “but that’s a long way away from claiming to have invented the technology that underpins the vaccines as we use them today.”
The vaccines “are the result of hundreds of scientists all over the world, all combining to come together to form this vaccine,” Dr. McAlpine said. “It was not one individual or the pioneering work of an individual person.”
A spokeswoman for Penn Medicine said, “We have been excited to witness the deployment of the vaccines in the global fight against the virus and the well-deserved global recognition for Drs. Kariko and Weissman’s decades of visionary basic science research.”

More than edifying edifices
The Jan. 2 editorial "A new golden age of public libraries" celebrated the architecture of many new and renovated public libraries, nationally and internationally, as "breathtakingly beautiful" and "cultural masterpieces." The new and renovated D.C. public libraries, including the recently opened Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library, deserved this shout-out. Public libraries have re-created themselves many times over the past century — from bookmobiles to electronic information — and will continue to do so to remain relevant.
Editorials and articles devoted to publicizing and celebrating public libraries as great community spaces are to be applauded. However, the mission of public libraries in this age of disinformation and lack of understanding and tolerance of diverse points of view is more important than facilities. The core mission of public libraries is to provide information that invites all of us, free of charge, to continue to educate ourselves and our children, to explore issues in-depth from many points of view and to become inspired about what is possible for ourselves, our families, our communities and our nation. This invitation to grow, imagine and think should have been in paragraph one.

Good news
I can sympathize with John Huey's desire to consume less vitriol disguised as "news" by reducing his consumption and hopefully augmenting his emotional well-being, as he wrote in his Jan. 4 op-ed, "All the news I intend to quit." However, his negative answer to a friend's question about whether there is a place to go "for just good news" was uninformed. He, his friend and others seeking well-crafted and uplifting stories should check out the nonprofit Solutions Journalism Network and the journalism and reporters affiliated with it.
Consuming dispiriting news is a choice, just as choosing positive, helpful and inspirational stories is.

Shutting out a shutout
Over New Year's weekend, University of Maryland redshirt senior wrestler Kyle Cochran, ranked No. 32, took the 184-pound title at the Southern Scuffle Tournament by going 5-0 over two days and beating opponents ranked 13th, 14th and 15th, and not giving up a single offensive point.
Wrestling is a winter sport, Maryland is a local university, and some of The Post's readers would appreciate a minimum of coverage, especially given Cochran's accomplishment.
Malcolm Wilson , Silver Spring
Interrogating the pollsters
The poll in the Jan. 2 front-page article "1 in 3 can justify violence against government" contained an alarming question: "Do you think it is ever justified for citizens to take violent action against the government, or is it never justified?" Nazi Germany probably springs to mind for most: a government that kills and imprisons, tortures anyone it doesn't like. Right?
The following part narrowed this to U.S.-specific cases and asked is violence justified if the "government violates or takes away rights or freedoms/oppresses people." The poll said 22 percent agreed that violence was acceptable in that case. But what does it mean to take away freedoms and "oppress"? The poll fell apart after this question.
Only 3 percent cited violence as justified in response to a "president or government [that] does not accept election results," and only — incredibly — 2 percent cited a takeover of the U.S. government by Nazis or fascists as justifying violence.
Why did the most robust case for justifying violence against a government — a Nazi-based takeover — get the weakest response? It's because the poll was flawed.
The Post misled the public by asserting that the risk of violence is much greater than it is. According to this poll, if only 2 percent are willing to take action against a Hitler 2.0, I seriously doubt people will launch a civil war over mask and vaccine mandates.

Wrong ways to memorialize
Why was it necessary to say in the Jan. 4 obituary for Alexander Garvin, "Urban planner guided Ground Zero rebuilding," that "his parents were Jewish immigrants from Latvia"? The Post doesn't say, "Her parents were Catholic immigrants from Ireland."
Jean Brodsky Bernard , Chevy Chase
The Jan. 4 obituary for Alexander Garvin stated, "Mr. Garvin believed redevelopment projects should not be imposed from above by all-powerful public officials or architects. Instead, they should develop from the ground up, reflecting the needs of local residents, office workers, commuters and business owners."
At Ground Zero, this is exactly what did not happen. And it means a large portion of the site fails as an asset to its community and New York City and as honoring the memory of Sept. 11, 2001.
The design of the dominant feature of the site — the eight-acre, billion-dollar memorial — was rejected by thousands of on-site and online public meeting attendees by nearly 2 to 1. The public overwhelmingly called for the memorial to include some authentic artifact that speaks directly to the site's history, as the USS Arizona Memorial and the Hiroshima Peace Memorial do.
This was ignored. Rather, all-knowing, handpicked academics and well-connected officials imposed a financially unsupportable "minimalist" memorial that intentionally remade the site so that it does not acknowledge its history so that visitors may, in the words of the architect, think about 9/11 "or not."
And they don't. They check messages and play games on their phones and pose as though they are at Disney. However, they cannot be criticized for disrespecting the history of the site when the memorial was specifically chosen because it does not respect this history.
Furthermore, now in the evenings, to save money, the waterfalls are turned off, rendering two massive, inert pits, and the memorial is, unbelievably, roped off from the public — leaving the site to fail in essentially every way.
At Ground Zero, vanity replaced duty, good sense and efficiency.
Michael Burke , New York
The writer, whose brother, Capt. William F. Burke Jr., died in the response to the Twin Towers attack, led the effort to return Fritz Koenig's damaged sculpture "The Sphere" to the World Trade Center site.

And in the same strip, Sally called Snoopy stupid!
I have been reading the comics section of the home newspaper since I was 6 or 7. Why does The Post keep reprinting the "Classic Peanuts" strip with no concern for offensive content, as in the Jan. 2 strip?
I might think that my brother is dumb, but I would never say that to his face. If I had called a classmate dumb even back when I was in school in the 1950s, my teacher would have scolded me, and my parents would have known about it.
Lynda M. Durfee , Alexandria
Fact-finding in the opinion section
In his Dec. 30 Thursday Opinion column, "This is the worst economy we never had," Dana Milbank pointed out how Fox News is being deceptive about the state of the economy. He cited numerous examples of the deception surrounding problems at Christmas that never materialized, and stated, "Americans, particularly Republicans, express a gloom not matched by economic reality. . . . This is, in large part, because disinformation has prevailed." True facts are not extensively reported in mainstream media.
I read The Post thoroughly every day. Why did I have to learn the facts of our booming economy from Milbank's column? Aren't the following significant enough to be the subject of a news story in The Post? The U.S. economy improved more in President Biden's first 12 months than under any other president during the past 50 years. The U.S. economy expanded at a rate that outpaced those of Europe and even China. U.S. stock markets outperformed those of the rest of the world.
Maybe good news doesn't sell papers, but isn't it the responsibility of the media to report on the true state of our economy? Without such reporting, why the surprise and angst about disinformation prevailing?

More on ‘fewer’
I disagree with Anne Curzan, who wrote in her Jan. 3 op-ed, "Words in English don't last forever. And that's okay.," that the difference in usage between "less" and "fewer" depends on whether something can be counted. It depends on whether one can have a fraction of it. Curzan quoted disapprovingly "less than two weeks." But there can be less than two weeks: Twelve days is less than two weeks; 1.5 weeks is less than two weeks. "Fewer than two weeks" is one week.
By contrast, one should always say "fewer people" because (except to statisticians) there's no such thing as half a person.
Kevin W. Parker , Greenbelt
Anne Curzan's op-ed resurrected a 40-year-old memory. I received A's in high school English and in freshman college English, but I was never taught the usage difference between "less" and "fewer." That was abruptly brought to my attention when I was working on my master's thesis in a health-care topic. Because of the nature of the research, I used "less" many times. And a member of my committee circled the word in bright red every time I should have used "fewer." This was in manual-typewriter days, and I had to change every single error.
I hope "fewer" never goes away.
Sue Borsuk , Glen Burnie
Anne Curzan's point that the English language is forever evolving was well taken — after all, the language has adapted well throughout both history and geography.
However, evolution of a language is not the same as its slow poisoning, which is not okay. I refer to the ghastly misuse and overuse of the word "like." Properly used, it is a verb ("I like tea") or it is followed by a noun ("She quivered like an aspen"). Regrettably, though, it has become a substitute for "as if/as though" ("We felt as though we had been ignored") or "that" ("It seemed that the movie would never end").
Further, it has been seen as an inane response to a surprising situation: "I was, like, wow!" And it has become a tiresome sentence interrupter: "I think, like, I might have to, like, leave early."
All this "like" cannot mean the English language is unfolding in a good way; rather, it demonstrates its invidious undermining, and, therefore, serves as an excellent reason to swipe left on a dating site or frown dismissively in other situations.

Making a vast difference to the vas deferens
Regarding the Dec. 28 front-page article "Across the U.S., vasectomies become an 'act of love' ":
I applaud the men and the men's movements promoting vasectomies, not only as a response to recent antiabortion laws but also because vasectomy is overall a safe and responsible means of family planning and population control. I had an outpatient needle-and-scalpel vasectomy almost 40 years ago — and it was virtually pain-free at that time. (I was even able to watch the doctor with the aid of a mirror!)
I was disappointed, however, that the article mentioned only that current vasectomy is "needle- and scalpel-free" but did not describe just what the procedure is. Knowing precisely what one can expect with a vasectomy would go a long way, I believe, toward encouraging more men to take the plunge.

Smooth jazz beyond the (O)G
As a jazz musician, I never cared for the "smooth jazz" label, preferring "instrumental pop" as a way to separate the jazz I know from music that's less complex. But given the economic realities of the U.S. music market, some serious players have taken a detour to the smooth side out of necessity.
I was delighted to see Sam Gendel and Sam Wilkes featured in Andy Beta's Jan. 2 Arts & Style essay, "2021 was the year smooth jazz gave us some serenity," as I recently discovered them in entirely different contexts. It turns out they are skilled players on the Los Angeles jazz scene and work in many genres, from "legit" jazz groups to the electro-funk of the group Knower to the ironic chaos of Clown Core. Perhaps they turned to instrumental pop out of necessity or just for the challenge of a musical outlet with different rules.
A few searches on YouTube will uncover what these fine musicians do when they're not keeping diners company.

A virtuous virtuoso
I am a huge fan of the cartoons and cartoonists featured in The Post. Usually, readers go to the editorial cartoons for commentary and the comics pages for fun and laughs. But who knew the comics could be a teaching tool as well?
See the Jan. 6 "Candorville" strip by Darrin Bell, who likely introduced many readers to Hazel Scott, a talented and committed singer and jazz pianist who also was a civil rights activist. It doesn't take much research to learn about Scott. Here's a Wikipedia excerpt: "Hazel Dorothy Scott (June 11, 1920 – October 2, 1981) was a Trinidad-born American jazz and classical pianist, singer, and actor. She was a critically acclaimed performing artist and an outspoken critic of racial discrimination and segregation. She used her influence to improve the representation of black Americans in film."
There's much more, including videos of her performances on YouTube. Bell deserves recognition and everyone's thanks. He certainly has mine.

Curb your enthusiasm for malapropisms
The Dec. 30 news article "Tributes pour in, revealing a soft spot for a mentor who was a 'fighter,' " about the late former senator Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), said Reid was "even ahead of the curb when he criticized the former name of the Washington Football Team in 2014." Ahead of the curb? Really? Was he on the sidewalk?
Reid was ahead of the curve.

Distinguish rioters from protesters
Near the end of the second paragraph, the Jan. 2 front-page article "Poll: Views of Capitol riot split on party lines" referred to "convicted protesters" and later referred to "protesters." Please, please, don't ever write that again.
The protesters went to the rally and then left. The people who have been convicted were rioters, insurrectionists, participants in a mob, trespassers, brawlers, hooligans, assailants. Saying they were protesters is like calling enslavers "employers" and gives cover to the people who called them peaceful and tourists and orderly.
Please, in the name of accurate and precise reporting, just stop.

Fuzzy resolutions
Kudos to Sergio Peçanha's Dec. 31 Friday Opinion column, "10 common-sense New Year's resolutions." However, he should have included the most important resolution: Pass the voting rights bill.
Lora Lee Rodriguez , Solomons, Md.
In his Dec. 31 column, "10 common-sense New Year's resolutions," Sergio Peçanha reinforced the white-supremacy narrative by stating, "Unless you're Native American, you're here because someone in your family was an immigrant." My ancestors did not choose to come from Africa to America as immigrants; they came as chattel. It is stunning that no one corrected this enormously myopic historical error before it went to print.
This type of institutionalized bias demonstrates why critical race theory, anti-racism education, the 1619 Project and groups such as Black Lives Matter continue to be vital and necessary in 2022.

WASHINGTON — For a day or two or maybe a week after the can-you-believe-this-is-happening-in-America events of a year ago, there were those who thought that the shock to the system might upend politics in a profound way.
That the country might speak as one against an attempt to overturn democracy. That the tribal divisions of the era might be overcome by a shared sense of revulsion. That a president who encouraged a mob that attacked Congress in a vain bid to hold onto power might be ostracized or at least fade into exile.
That was then. A year after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol in which supporters of President Donald Trump trying to stop final recognition of a certified free and fair election burst through barricades, pummeled police officers and forced lawmakers to flee for their lives, what is most striking is not what has changed, but what has not.
America has not come together to defend its democracy; it has only split further apart. Lies and disinformation spread by the former president have so permeated the political ecosphere that nearly universal outrage has reverted to separate blue and red realities. Far from shunned for what even his own vice president deemed an unconstitutional attempt to thwart the will of the voters, Trump remains the undisputed powerhouse of his party — and a viable candidate to reclaim the White House in three years.
“I just kept hoping that that was going to change after the election,” said Olivia Troye, a lifelong Republican who worked on the White House coronavirus task force before breaking with Trump in 2020 and joining efforts to defeat him. “And then with the events after the election and Jan. 6, it became clear this was something that was going to be even more dangerous and pervasive than one man sitting in the Oval Office.”
The anniversary of the assault on the Capitol serves as a chance to take stock of a country still trying to make sense of it all. Rather than a wake-up call highlighting for all the fragility of the American experiment, the violence that besieged Washington turns out to have been one more chapter in the polarizing, partisan, ideological and cultural struggle over truth and consequences in the modern era.
The disparate approaches to Thursday’s anniversary reflect the fraught condition of the nation’s politics. Rather than join in unified commemoration, President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats will hold events marking the moment while Republican leaders plan to absent themselves. Trump originally planned to hold his first post-presidential news conference Thursday but abruptly changed his mind.
While Biden and the Democrats describe the dangers to the constitutional order from what amounted to an anti-democratic insurrection, Trump and his allies rail against a congressional investigating committee and seek to rewrite history by repeating wild and false claims about a supposedly stolen election and asserting that the riot was born out of justified anger.
“Why is the primary reason for the people coming to Washington D.C., which is the fraud of the 2020 Presidential Election, not the primary topic of the Unselect Committee’s investigation?” Trump said in a statement this week. “This was, indeed, the Crime of the Century.”
In fact, no matter how many times Trump says the 2020 election was stolen, not a shred of evidence has emerged to prove it. Not one independent authority — no judge, no prosecutor, no governor, no election agency, no news media organization — has found any credible indication of fraud on a scale that would have changed the outcome.
An extensive, monthslong review by The Associated Press of every fraud claim in six battleground states targeted by Trump found fewer than 475 suspicious votes or attempted votes. That was not nearly enough to swing the results in a single state, much less the three or more necessary to tip the Electoral College, even if all of them had been counted for Biden, which they were not.
But the extent to which Trump has shaped the narrative, at least within his own party, would have defied belief a year ago when leaders on both sides of the aisle were seething with indignation at what he had unleashed. At the time, even allies thought Trump had forever sullied his name in the history books, as indicated by the subsequent investigation.
While intruders marauded through the Capitol, Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host, texted the White House chief of staff imploring him to get the president to call off the mob, warning that “he is destroying his legacy.” Her colleague Brian Kilmeade likewise texted that Trump was “destroying everything you have accomplished.”
Today, it has become heresy among conservatives to question Trump’s legacy. The Cabinet secretaries and White House aides who resigned in protest of his role in the violence now largely keep to themselves. Many corporations that vowed to halt donations to Republican lawmakers who voted to overturn the election have quietly reopened the contribution spigot. The congressional Republicans who angrily denounced the president after their headquarters was invaded have gone silent or even made the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago, all but pretending it never happened.
“It’s a pretty sobering lesson about human nature,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a Democrat who led the House managers prosecuting Trump in a Senate impeachment trial and now serves on the House select committee investigating Jan. 6.
In an interview, Raskin said he had ordered books about cults and deprogramming to try to understand his Republican colleagues. “It’s amazing to me how many of these Republican leaders have just fallen into line like lemmings,” he said. “I tell them when it’s all over, they’re only going to be fit to sell flowers and incense at Dulles Airport. They have basically surrendered their critical thinking skills.”
Raskin, who this week published “Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth, and the Trials of American Democracy,” his own book on Jan. 6 and the subsequent Senate trial, at one point a year ago thought enough Republicans were fed up with Trump to convict him of high crimes and misdemeanors. In fact, just seven Republican senators voted to convict, short of the 17 required along with Democrats for a two-thirds majority, but it was the most bipartisan Senate vote in presidential impeachment history.
A year later, neither Raskin nor anyone else can say for sure that even those seven Republicans would still back conviction. “Rejecting the fact that Joe Biden won the 2020 election is now the organizing principle of the GOP,” he said. “That is a terrifying and astonishing new reality that we have to contend with.”
For many Republicans, even those who privately despise Trump and agree that Biden was legitimately elected, Jan. 6 is a topic to avoid. They bristle at the focus on it, seeing it not as a good-faith effort to find out what happened but a partisan weapon to tear them down and distract from the Democrats’ own failed policies.
And then there are the Republicans still firmly in the former president’s camp and eager to take on the fight and amplify his claims, like his onetime chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who is hosting a podcast with other Trump allies on the anniversary to counterprogram the Democratic-led events.
Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, said that “Jan. 6 is going to be a disaster rather than an asset for Democrats” that will cost them seats in the November midterm elections. While he said those who broke into the Capitol should be brought to justice and the event investigated, he argued that Democrats were covering up their own complicity in not providing adequate security for the Capitol.
“The process of the select committee is only getting more corrupt and destructive,” Gingrich wrote in a newsletter this week. “Using an outrageous, painful and unacceptable event (which I fully condemn) to smear your opponents rather than find the truth will ultimately be repudiated by the American people.”
In fact, at the time of the attack, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, shared control of the Capitol with the Senate majority leader, who at the time was Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Republicans have made no attempt to blame McConnell for the security breach or for failing to prepare for an attack.
As unlikely as it seemed 365 days ago, Trump emerged from the wreckage of Jan. 6 still the dominant force within the party. Those who speak against him are purged, and his endorsement is the most coveted asset in almost any Republican primary. One Republican senator privately explained his reluctance to break with Trump by noting that the former president polled better among Republicans in his state than he did. “You can’t minimize that in terms of the political reality,” the senator said.
Still, Trump is not all powerful. For months, he has railed against McConnell, demanding that Republican senators remove him as their leader. Republican senators have uniformly ignored Trump as if his rants were irrelevant.
And there are times when Trump appears not so much in command of his base as a captive of it. When he urged an Alabama audience in August to get vaccinated for the coronavirus — a vaccine he helped generate — the crowd booed him. Taking the point, he avoided bringing up the vaccine again for months.
When he said in Texas last month that he had received a booster, he was booed again. This time, he told supporters that although “you shouldn’t be forced to take it,” they were “playing into their hands,” meaning his opponents, by denigrating the vaccine. By Wednesday, he pivoted to a full-throated attack on vaccine mandates. “This is an outrage, and MAGA nation should rise up and oppose this egregious federal government overreach,” he said in a statement.
If he is at odds with his base over vaccines, they are in sync on the election and Jan. 6. Fresh polls have documented the public divide in stark terms. While nearly three-quarters of all Americans view the storming of the Capitol as an assault on democracy, about half of Republicans say the rioters were actually the ones “protecting democracy,” and nearly as many think the attack was not that violent. While most Americans believe Biden was elected legitimately, 7 in 10 Republicans think otherwise.
“The truly dangerous position we’re in now is there are tens of millions of Americans who are either opposed to or agnostic about whether this country is tied to what we would think of as core democratic principles,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “We missed that. The reason why it wasn’t a wake-up call is they have already disconnected from the idea that rule of law matters.”
At the root of the explosion a year ago were factors beyond just Trump, including culture, economics, education, geography and especially race. A study of those arrested after Jan. 6 conducted by Robert A. Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago, found that counties where the white population has been dropping were more likely to have sent rioters to Washington.
“Trump as shorthand is easy to talk about and write about, but what if he’s not the center of gravity of the problem?” said Eddie S. Glaude Jr., chair of the department of African American studies at Princeton University in New Jersey.
And a year later, Glaude added, the risk is thinking the danger has passed just because the fences around the Capitol have come down and many of the invaders have been locked up.
“The front end of a hurricane is really, really violent, and then you have the calm of the eye,” he said. “But then the tail is coming, and the tail is just as violent as the front end.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The big idea
On anniversary of Jan. 6, Trump's 'Big Lie' has only gained traction Christmas has come and gone, but this week the specter of elections past and ghost of elections future will haunt Washington.
One year ago this Thursday, thousands of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and interrupted the certification of Joe Biden's presidential election victory, denying America the peaceful transfer of power that is a hallmark of healthy, functioning democracies.
On that fraught anniversary, President Biden and his predecessor will lay out dueling visions of what the insurrection means for American politics – even as Congress pursues its investigation into the violence and Trump's role in it, and the former president's loyalists whitewash the worst attack on the U.S. electoral system and his role in inspiring it.
Biden and Vice President Harris will make remarks Thursday morning from National Statuary Hall in the Capitol, according to a knowledgeable source. Trump will speak from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida around 5 p.m., his office announced last week.
This isn't some shrug-your-shoulders-and-roll-your-eyes partisan circus. How Americans understand Trump's months-long, falsehood-fueled campaign to overturn the 2020 election, ultimately calling on supporters to march on the Capitol a year ago, remains a clear and present force shaping U.S. politics.
That includes, as I wrote in a piece that published this weekend, this year's midterm contests. The same false GOP claims of voter fraud in 2020 that fueled the insurrection have driven Republican efforts at the state level to take control of the country's electoral processes and rewrite election laws.
In response, Biden indicated renewed interest last month in federal action to expand access to voting (after his Build Back Better legislation stalled), then came out explicitly in favor of carving out an exception to the filibuster to pass legislation to achieve that purpose. There's no reason to think this will win over Democratic holdouts like Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) who have refused to alter Senate rules.
Trump, on the other hand, can be counted on to repeat his election falsehoods on Thursday – not only has he shown no contrition, his claims have escalated to the point where he now says Biden's legitimate election, not the insurrection, was the true act of violence against the republic.
He can also be expected to try to focus voters on other arguments that have caught fire on the right: Allegations of spikes in violent crime, immigration chaos at the southern border, a surge in inflation that has hit American wallets, and control over what is taught about race in the nation's schools.
The numbers Still, far from receding in history's rear-view mirror, the story of the events leading up to the insurrection, the West Wing response, and the Republican party's reaction to what has come to be known as Trump's "Big Lie" that he was cheated out of a second term has only gained importance.
And what a response from the GOP, as my colleagues Dan Balz, Scott Clement, and Emily Guskin documented this weekend.
"Overall, 60 percent of Americans say Trump bears either a 'great deal' or a 'good amount' of responsibility for the insurrection, but 72 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Trump voters say he bears 'just some' responsibility or 'none at all,'" they noted.
No authorities anywhere in the United States have turned up evidence supporting Trump's repeated contention that fraud decided the outcome of the election. But the former president, who never conceded, hasn't lost GOP adherents to his false claims.
"Big majorities of Democrats (88 percent) and independents (74 percent) say there is no evidence of such irregularities, but 62 percent of Republicans say there is such evidence. That is almost identical to the percentage of Republicans who agreed with Trump's claims of voter fraud a week after that Capitol attack, based on a Washington Post-ABC News poll at the time."
A CBS News-YouGov poll released yesterday found fairly resilient overall condemnation of the actions of those who forced their way into the Capitol – 83 percent disapprove now, down from 87 percent last January.
But 56 percent of Republicans say what happened at the Capitol was "defending freedom" and another 47 percent say it was "patriotism." (And 41 percent of GOP respondents said they believed most of those who ransacked the Capitol were "left-leaning groups" in disguise.)
In our poll, "78 percent of Democrats describe the protesters as mostly violent compared with 26 percent of Republicans. Thirty-six percent of Republicans say the protesters were mostly peaceful, compared to 5 percent of Democrats."
We also found that more than one-third of Americans say they aren't confident their votes will be counted this year – including about 60 percent of Republicans and less than 20 percent of Democrats. And about one in three respondents said they aren't confident all eligible citizens will be able to vote, with Democrats predictably more concerned.
Away from what I have dubbed "crass politics," the insurrection has had significant human costs, with many of those traumatized by the day's events quitting jobs in which they had found considerable pride, my colleagues Paul Schwartzman and Peter Jamison chronicled this weekend.
They quoted one police officer, anonymously, saying that one thing that has made it hard to recover is the way Republicans have played down the insurrection – in some cases after fueling it.
"'You see people don't even appreciate what you've been through,'" he said. "You've got people that we protect that were literally out there pumping the crowd up. What the f---?'"
What's happening now
Schumer says Senate will vote by Jan. 17 on changing rules if GOP continues to block voting-rights legislation "The announcement of the planned action by Jan. 17 represented Schumer's strongest endorsement yet of trying to muscle through legislation that has been stymied because of Senate rules requiring a 60-vote threshold," John Wagner reports.
FDA authorizes coronavirus vaccine boosters for 12- to 15-year-olds as schools reopen amid omicron surge "The agency also cleared booster shots for children 5 to 11 with compromised immune systems. And it said anyone eligible for a booster could get the shot five months after receiving the second Pfizer-BioNTech shot, down from six months," Laurie McGinley reports.
Trump offers unusual endorsement of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban ahead of parliamentary elections "Former president Donald Trump on Monday made an unusual endorsement in a foreign election, offering his 'Complete support' for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a right-wing populist leader accused of undermining the country's democracy and moving toward autocracy during more than a decade in power," John Wagner reports.
Monthly child-tax-credit payments cease, ending cushion for family budgets "Families are bracing for bank balances to suffer when the middle of January comes and the monthly child-tax-credit payment doesn't," the Wall Street Journal's Rachel Louise Ensign and Richard Rubin report.
"More than 30 million households started getting up to $300 per child in July after Congress temporarily transformed an annual tax break into a near-universal monthly benefit. … Families spent the money on essentials like groceries and stashed it as emergency savings, researchers found."
Tesla opens showroom in China's Xinjiang, region at center of U.S. genocide allegations "Researchers say authorities in Xinjiang have detained as many as a million Uyghurs and members of other Turkic Muslim minority groups in a network of internment camps as part of the government's assimilation campaign, which they say also includes mass surveillance, forced labor and stringent birth controls. The U.S. government, along with some lawmakers from other Western countries, have said the those policies amount to a form of genocide," the WSJ's Liza Lin reports.
Lunchtime reads from The Post
Since Jan. 6, the pro-Trump Internet has descended into infighting over money and followers "QAnon devotees are livid at their former hero Michael Flynn for accurately calling their jumbled credo 'total nonsense.' Donald Trump superfans have voiced a sense of betrayal because the former president, booed for getting a coronavirus immunization booster, has become a 'vaccine salesman.' And attorney Lin Wood seems mad at pretty much everyone, including former allies on the scattered 'elite strike-force team' investigating nonexistent mass voter fraud," Drew Harwell reports.
"The infighting reflects the diminishing financial rewards for the merchants of right-wing disinformation, whose battles center not on policy or doctrine but on the treasures of online fame: viewer donations and subscriptions; paid appearances at rallies and conferences; and crowds of followers to buy their books and merchandise."
"But it also reflects a broader confusion in the year since QAnon's faceless nonsense-peddler, Q, went mysteriously silent."
… and beyond
Could Jan. 6 happen again? "The political blight that contributed to the attack has only worsened, inside and outside the Capitol. So while leaders feel readier today than they did on Jan. 5, no one is rushing to declare the threat has passed," Politico's Kyle Cheney reports.
" 'The last thing that I want to do is say, "this could never happen again" and have it sound like a challenge to those people,' said Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, who took over the department in August after his predecessor's ouster following the siege. 'I'm not trying to be overconfident. We are much better prepared.' "
Good cop, bad cop "North Carolina was one of more than 30 states to pass new police oversight and reform laws in 2021. While elected officials in Raleigh were able to find common ground, compromise on their differences, and reach a deal, members of Congress could not do the same. How police reform was enacted in North Carolina, but not by federal lawmakers, offers a case study in what was good—and disappointing—about politics in 2021," John Drescher and Kasonia Smith report for the Assembly.
The rise of omicron
Fauci: CDC mulling covid test requirement for asymptomatic "As the COVID-19 omicron variant surges across the United States, top federal health officials are looking to add a negative test along with its five-day isolation restrictions for asymptomatic Americans who catch the coronavirus, the White House's top medical adviser said Sunday," the Associated Press's Hope Yen and Aamer Madhani report.
The Biden agenda
In latest effort to combat rising prices, White House to offer $1 billion in aid for smaller meat-industry producers "The White House on Monday announced it will devote $1 billion to aiding independent meat and poultry producers, aiming to undercut the four powerful meat producers the Biden administration has alleged are responsible for surging consumer prices," Jeff Stein reports.
Angst over China, Russia lessens chance of U.S. nuke policy changes "Now, major shifts in U.S. nuclear weapons policy seem much less likely, and while Biden may insist on certain adjustments, momentum toward a historic departure from the Trump administration's policy appears to have stalled," the AP's Robert Burns reports.
Biden pushed to speak out more as U.S. democracy concerns grow "While Biden has tried to offer America's allies assurances, he has only occasionally emphasized the gravity of the threat to democracy from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the repeated lie from the man he defeated, Donald Trump, that the 2020 election was stolen. And he's not discussed the very real concerns about a growing collection of insurrection sympathizers installed in local election posts and changes by Republicans to election laws in several states," the AP's Colleen Long and Zeke Miller report.
Trump’s culpability on Jan. 6 insurrection polled, visualized
One year after the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol, Republicans and Democrats are deeply divided over what happened that day and the degree to which Trump bears responsibility for the assault, amid more universal signs of flagging pride in the workings of democracy at home, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.
Hot on the left
The care crisis isn't what you think "President Biden's signature Build Back Better bill, which includes funding for long-neglected social programs like Medicaid's home and community-based services (HCBS), is facing an uncertain future. An upgraded HCBS program would allow millions of people currently stuck on wait lists to receive care at home, rather than in congregant settings. But facing questions from the likes of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) about cost, the new investments in HCBS may not become law," Laura Mauldin writes for the American Prospect.
"Here's what we don't talk about when we talk about the care crisis. When it comes to disability, we devalue care (both caregiving and paid care work) because we devalue the people who need it. It's why we position care as a response to a horrible disaster. It's why we refuse to adequately fund home care and fairly pay care workers. It's why we rely on the 53 million (and climbing) unpaid family caregivers across the U.S. to provide care for free."
Hot on the right
Trump is making the midterms a referendum on himself "Donald Trump will own the midterms just as much as Joe Biden will. Voters' verdicts on Trump will come in Idaho, Alabama, and Georgia this spring. Then in Arizona, Alaska, and Wyoming in summer. Trump has already endorsed candidates in 2022 primary contests in all of those states. He's made picks in nearly 40 congressional races to date, most recently training his ammunition on the House Republicans who voted for the bipartisan infrastructure package. He's made another nine endorsements in gubernatorial primaries, including one against the GOP incumbent in Idaho," David Catanese writes for the Atlantic.
"The former president's ultimate record in these races will serve as the first barometer of his continued strength as he eyes a comeback bid for the White House in 2024. So far, his picks have lifted challengers to GOP incumbents who have crossed him and a bevy of newcomers who are eager to align with his brand."
Today in Washington
At 1:30 p.m., Biden will meet virtually "with family and independent farmers and ranchers to discuss his administration's work to boost competition and reduce prices in the meat-processing industry." Attorney General Merrick Garland and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack will also attend.
The White House's daily news conference has been canceled today due to federal offices being closed because of snow.
In closing
Happy snow day, D.C.! Do you miss Betty White as much as we do? Travis M. Andrews compiled seven clips of her that might help cheer you up. Here's a sneak peek:

Full text: Baltimore - The eighth-graders at Baltimore Design School have just one more class period separating them from a holiday weekend, the excitement palpable as the doctor attempts to get their attention.
Panagis Galiatsatos, a son of Greek immigrants who dreamed of serving the city that took them in, tells them he grew up not far from the school.
"You can call me Dr. G," he says. "It's also my DJ name, if you ever want to go to the club with me."
This intrigues the students, some of whom believe that all scientists somehow work for the government and have an agenda, according to their health teacher, Erin Nutsugah.
But that's the beauty of "Ask an Expert" day in Nutsugah's classroom, the final exercise in her two-week unit about the coronavirus. With Galiatsatos's help, she said, the kids may shake off their unconscious biases about the health-care system and get their questions answered by a knowledgeable source.
Nutsugah, a 10-year educator who teaches such topics as mental health, nutrition, substance abuse and reproductive health, said she felt compelled to cover the coronavirus in class this year and offer students a way to make sense of the public health crisis. There was no state or district curriculum for her to follow, she said, so she created one with support from the Johns Hopkins Health Education and Training Corps.
"It's vital we all understand what we're dealing with, because we're still dealing with it," Nutsugah said. "It surprises me what they do and don't believe."
Public health experts have long worried about the effects of misinformation and disinformation on getting the public vaccinated, saying that just a few malicious actors have convinced millions of Americans that the shots are neither safe nor effective. The conspiracy theories, lies and misconceptions about the vaccines and about the virus have spread so far that they have trickled down into the youngest of minds.
Enter Galiatsatos, who specializes in lung and critical care treatment at Johns Hopkins Medicine and co-leads the institution's Medicine for the Greater Good initiative, a partnership between Hopkins, schools and communities that aims to promote health and wellness through education. Along with several of his Hopkins colleagues, he created a free curriculum and educational program to teach K-12 learners about the science behind the disease.
He helps train and deploy Hopkins students studying medicine, public health and nursing into classes to lead sessions, a way to reach even more schools.
No question is too big or small for Galiatsatos or his trainees, who say they take each one seriously and never try to shame a student for what they believe or don't understand. Galiatsatos said they're there to arm students with the science they need to become ambassadors for public health.
The more than 160 student volunteers for the Johns Hopkins Health Education and Training Corps, also known as the HEAT Corps, have logged more than 2,200 sessions in about 200 classrooms, with several in Baltimore and others as far away as Guatemala, India and Sudan. Galiatsatos visits more on his own, including a recent stop at Navajo Preparatory School in New Mexico, where he helped answer parents' questions about booster shots and how to safely gather during the winter holidays.
A joint venture of Hopkins-affiliated researchers, clinicians and educators, the HEAT Corps curriculum launched in July 2020 and has been revised and compressed in the months since. It's funded with annual contributions of $200,000 from Johns Hopkins University and $100,000 from Hopkins Health System, and it received a two-year, $300,000-per-year grant from the Baltimore City Health Department in July to deliver the curriculum across the city's public school system.
The idea stemmed from the number of teachers calling on Galiatsatos for help during the initial months of the pandemic as school buildings closed and students expressed worry over how long they would be stuck at home. He had relationships with schools from his work with Medicine for the Greater Good and had visited classrooms to talk about topics such as lung health and air pollution. Now, could he come back and explain this new world to them?
In Nutsugah's classroom, Galiatsatos captivates the students. Through fist bumps, jokes and kid-friendly analogies, he earns their attention. By the end of class, nearly every student had spoken.
Since the coronavirus arrived in early 2020, he has visited classrooms - virtually or in person - to challenge students to think about how they can advocate for public health.
"So, you're here to convince us to get the vaccine?" asks Priyasha Morris, who sits near the front of Nutsugah's classroom.
No, Galiatsatos says. But that doesn't mean they're off the hook.
"I was invited by your teacher to help you do something no other generation has done before," he said, daring them to think of themselves as characters in a Marvel movie. "What role can you play, right now, to end the pandemic?"
"Wow," a student responds.
Annette Anderson, assistant professor at Hopkins' school of education, helped design the coronavirus curriculum.
"We are fond of saying, we built the plane while we were flying it," she said. "We were parsing it out to make it appropriate, but also being responsive because we were all trying to figure it out at the same time."
Anderson said keeping up with the pandemic's latest twists and turns poses a challenge for the HEAT Corps, which updated the curriculum at the beginning of the school year with more information about variants, for instance. The curriculum designers engage in debates about what to include and what to omit, what qualifies as too graphic and what's age-appropriate for children, she said.
The curriculum shouldn't be considered a "catchall," Anderson said. For example, it briefly touches on the theory that the coronavirus probably developed out of animal-to-human contact, known as "zoonotic" spread, one of the curriculum's vocabulary words.
Although the virus's zoonotic spread theory has not been proved - even some federal officials in the United States contend that the virus could have been developed and accidentally released from a lab in Wuhan, China - Anderson said the designers consulted their experts and stuck to what they considered the most plausible and scientifically sound scenario.
Galiatsatos also instructs HEAT Corps volunteers to be honest about their own knowledge gaps. That helps lessen some of the pressure associated with teaching such a contentious topic, said Ndeye Silla, a graduate student working toward her master's degree at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who led a virtual session for third-to-fifth-grade students in October at St. Jerome Regional School in eastern Pennsylvania.
"It's important to be honest and explain it as best we can," Silla said. "I say: 'Even though I'm telling you this information, it could change. I know it's hard to understand. Even for adults, it's complicated.' "
Silla and co-leader Britney Murray's session at St. Jerome, a Catholic school, covered the basics: what the coronavirus is and how it got its name, how it spreads and what can be done to blunt its impact. They used visual aids to demonstrate what a "superspreader" event looks like, reviewed vocabulary words such as "contact tracing," "herd immunity" and "self care," and explained the differences between the available vaccines.
When Silla and Murray opened the floor to questions, kids took turns raising their hands and sharing the problems they had been gaming out in their heads. The questions ranged from the practical ("If you get the vaccine, can you still get the virus?") to the hypothetical ("What would happen if you can't tell you're sick, but you go get the vaccine?")
Even for such young children, some of their concerns mirrored those of adults.
"What if you have the virus, and then you touch your friend?" one girl asked.
"What happens if you spread the virus, and you don't know if you spread it?" a boy asked.
Murray encouraged the students to apply the information they had learned about social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing, which she and Silla emphasized repeatedly.
With some of the older kids, the questions sometimes veered into more challenging territory.
During a session with sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders at St. Jerome Regional, one student asked why people had to wear masks after "20 years of research" showing that they don't stop the transmission of viruses.
The co-leaders of that session, Chanel Lee and Barath Biyyala, said that research shows masks do reduce virus transmission, especially if everyone in a close-contact situation wears them and they're fitted properly to people's faces.
But among children of all age groups, no matter how they thought about the coronavirus and the vaccines, there was one question that united them: They want to know when the pandemic will be over.

Full text: Only four more weeks in 2021. Where did the year go? We've got the latest on the coronavirus variant and an investigation into all of Trump's contacts between the time he tested positive for the coronavirus and was hospitalized in Walter Reed last fall. But first:
Medical boards are moving cautiously on doctors spreading vaccine misinformation State medical boards are fielding more complaints about false and misleading information during the pandemic, but only a minority have taken action against doctors.
That's the finding of a survey from the Federation of State Medical Boards, the umbrella organization for state medical boards, set to be released this week and shared early with The Health 202.
The group surveyed its 70 member boards in September and October.
More than two-thirds of the 58 boards that responded had seen an uptick in complaints.
A dozen boards, representing roughly 1 in 5 respondents, reported taking some sort of disciplinary action against doctors for spreading false or misleading information. (Some states have multiple boards because they have separate boards covering osteopathic doctors.)
Humayun J. Chaudhry, the president of the Federation of State Medical Boards, said the survey shows state medical boards are attentive to the issue, but he emphasized that the investigation takes time. Not all instances of potential misinformation are clear cut, doctors must be granted due process, and the board must hear all aspects of a case, Chaudhry said.
But…
Some critics want more done to keep doctors from spreading misinformation.
At a time when many Americans are willing to endorse conspiracies around the virus and top health officials are blaming misinformation for fueling vaccine refusal, there's a growing demand for medical boards to make sure the doctors they license aren't contributing to coronavirus misinformation. While only a small minority of doctors are actively spreading disinformation, experts argue that irresponsible doctors can have an outsize impact.
Misinformation from doctors can be particularly insidious because doctors can leverage the credibility of their professional association and often use highly technical language that is hard for the public to "debunk," according to Rachel Moran, a researcher at the University of Washington who studies coronavirus misinformation. 
"When encountering vaccine hesitancy our advice is usually to tell people to 'discuss concerns around the vaccine with their doctor' — but if your doctor is actively spreading misinformation then this trust is only going to cement your hesitancy," Moran said.
Warnings
Medical boards are threatening action.
In July, the Federation of State Medical Boards issued a statement warning that doctors who spread coronavirus vaccine misinformation risk disciplinary action, including the revocation of their license. Physicians, the statement said, have an "ethical and professional responsibility to practice medicine in the best interests of their patients," which is violated when they spread inaccurate information about the vaccines. They were soon followed by other certifying boards focused on specific specialties, including the American Board of Family Medicine, American Board of Internal Medicine and American Board of Pediatrics.
A handful of doctors have already lost their licenses:
The Oregon Medical Board revoked the license of a doctor who refused to follow public health guidelines in his clinic, spread misinformation about masks and overprescribed opioids.
A San Francisco doctor who promoted a false conspiracy linking covid-19 with 5G networks surrendered his license to California's medical board.
Rhode Island's Board of Medical Licensure suspended the license of a doctor who discouraged patients from getting the coronavirus vaccines.
Some researchers point to examples of doctors who have maintained — or even renewed — their licenses despite making dangerous statements about the virus.
Among them are Sherri Tenpenny — an Ohio-based licensed osteopathic physician and anti-vaccine advocate, who gained notoriety for claiming the coronavirus vaccines could leave people "magnetized" during testimony before the Ohio House of Representatives this summer  — and Rashid Buttar, a North Carolina osteopathic physician who has falsely claimed that coronavirus vaccines kill more people than covid-19. 
(A spokesperson for the Ohio Medical Board said the board cannot discuss confidential complaints but noted the board's renewal process is automated. A spokesperson for the North Carolina Medical Board also declined to comment on any ongoing complaints or investigations but said the board has taken action on two previous occasions against Buttar and that his current license is subject to certain restrictions. One of those occasions was for allegedly providing ineffectual treatments to cancer patients.) 
Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, an advocacy organization focused on misinformation, said doctors spreading disinformation need to lose their licenses.
​​"If the first rule of medical ethics is do no harm, how can they let people who've broken the prime directive continue [to practice]?" he asked.
Coronavirus
Trump may have left a coronavirus trail The week before Walter Reed: After President Trump first tested positive for the coronavirus, he came in contact with more than 500 people, either in proximity to him or at crowded events, not including rallygoers.
That's according to a deep dive on the days from that first positive test before Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, The Post's Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey report. 
The episode "reveals a president and chief of staff who took a reckless, and potentially dangerous, approach to handling the coronavirus, including Trump's own positive test," Ashley and Josh write.
The first test: Trump learned he tested positive for the coronavirus on Sept. 26, 2020. He was already aboard Air Force One, and headed to a massive rally in Middletown, Pa. — a stunning revelation his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, made in his book set to publish Tuesday and obtained by the Guardian.
A second rapid antigen test, which apparently used the same sample, came back negative. Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Trump should have then taken a more accurate PCR test to confirm whether he had covid-19.
Trump would go on to hold a massive rally in Middletown, Pa.; host an event for families who lost loved ones to military combat; debate Joe Biden; talk to reporters unmasked on Air Force One; and more. On Oct. 2, 2020, just before 1 a.m., Trump tweeted that he and Melania Trump tested positive. 
Four questions scientists are still racing to determine about omicron Scientists are urging patience as they rush to learn more about the omicron variant, The Post's Carolyn Y. Johnson and Joel Achenbach report.
Here's what scientists are watching: 
Will the new variant usurp delta? Researchers need two more weeks to see laboratory data and what the virus does on the ground, said John Mascola, director of the National Institutes of Health's Vaccine Research Center.
Will omicron dodge the immune system's defenses? A preprint from South Africa found evidence that reinfection may be far more common with omicron than with previous outbreaks, but it didn't shed light on their severity or how much protection the vaccines provide.
How transmissible is it? Some preliminary data from South Africa suggests that it could spread more easily than delta. One preprint suggests that omicron may have picked up a snippet of genetic code found in a virus that causes the common cold, which could make it more transmissible.
What's the variant's severity? It's still unclear whether omicron will cause more severe illness than other strains of the virus. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser, said on CNN on Sunday that the signs are encouraging but cautioned it was too early to draw firm conclusions.
Here's what else you need to know: The Biden administration is reevaluating its controversial decision to impose a travel ban on South Africa and seven other countries with the hopes of lifting it soon, Fauci said on CNN.
Data on vaccines for kids younger than 5 years old could come before the end of the year, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told NBC News.
The Minnesota man who contracted the omicron variant met up with 35 friends at a New York City anime convention. About half have tested positive for the coronavirus, our colleagues Lenny Bernstein, Frances Stead Sellers and Fenit Nirappil report.
A cyberattack took Maryland's health department offline this weekend, as officials investigate the scope of the incident, our colleague Dan Diamond reports.
Have you wondered what it's like to cover the coronavirus? Dan dishes all with Bryan Curtis in the latest episode of The Ringer's Press Box podcast.
State scan
Oklahoma has enrolled many more newly eligible for Medicaid than Missouri Voters in both Missouri and Oklahoma voted to expand Medicaid last year, but the experiences of the two Republican-led states have diverged widely since then, Kaiser Health News's Bram Sable-Smith reports. 
Oklahoma has enrolled more than 210,000 of some 215,000 newly eligible people.
Missouri, which has an estimated 275,000 newly eligible people, has enrolled fewer than 20,000.
Republican leaders in both states had resisted Obamacare's Medicaid expansion for years. But when Oklahoma voters approved the expansion, the legislature appropriated $164 million to fund it.
Applications opened up in June and 113,000 people were approved within a month.
In Missouri, in contrast, the legislature refused to fund the expansion, and the governor threatened to withdraw it.
Even when a judge in August ordered the state to start accepting applications, Missouri did not begin processing them until Oct. 1. The convoluted back and forth means many Missouri residents may not know they are eligible.

Today: Biden will deliver remarks this afternoon about the drug pricing provisions included in Democrats' sprawling economic package.
Senate Democrats are slated to discuss the health provisions in Biden's economic package with the parliamentarian, who is the arbiter of what's allowed under the budget maneuver the party is using to pass the bill without any GOP votes. A Senate Democratic aide confirmed the news, which Politico first reported.
Wednesday: The House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee will hold a hearing on the future of biomedicine.
Thursday: The House Oversight and Reform Committee will discuss findings from its drug pricing investigation.

Full text: The eighth graders at Baltimore Design School have just one more class period separating them from a holiday weekend, the excitement palpable as the doctor attempts to get their attention.
Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos grew up not far from the school, he tells them, a son of Greek immigrants who dreamed of serving the city that took them in. "Tostitos!" one child called out as Galiatsatos patiently explained how to say his name.
"You can call me Dr. G," he says. "It's also my DJ name, if you ever want to go to the club with me."
This intrigues the students, some of whom believe that all scientists somehow work for the government and have an agenda, according to their health teacher, Erin Nutsugah.
But that's the beauty of "Ask an Expert" day in Nutsugah's classroom, the final exercise in her two-week unit about the coronavirus. With Dr. G's help, she said, the kids may shake off their unconscious biases about the health care system, get their questions answered by a knowledgeable source and see a pathway into the medical field they may otherwise have overlooked.
Nutsugah, a 10-year educator who teaches such topics as mental health, nutrition, substance abuse and reproductive health, said she felt compelled to cover COVID-19 in class this year and offer students a way to make sense of the public health crisis. There was no state or district curriculum for her to follow, she said, so she created one with supportfrom the Johns Hopkins Health Education and Training Corps.
"It's vital we all understand what we're dealing with, because we're still dealing with it," Nutsugah said. "It surprises me what they do and don't believe."
Public health experts have long worried about the effects of misinformation and disinformation on getting the public vaccinated, saying that just a few malicious actors have convinced millions of Americans that the shots are neither safe nor effective. The conspiracy theories, lies and misconceptions about the vaccines and about the virus in general have spread so far that they have trickled down into the youngest of minds.
Enter Galiatsatos, who specializes in lung and critical care treatment at Johns Hopkins Medicine and coleads the institution's Medicine for the Greater Good initiative - a partnership between Hopkins, schools and communities that aims to promote health and wellness through education. Along with several of his Hopkins colleagues, he created a free curriculum and educational program to teach K-12 learners about the science behind the disease.
He helps train and deploy Hopkins students studying medicine, public health and nursing into classes to lead sessions, a way to reach even more schools.
No question is too big or small for Galiatsatos or his trainees, who say they take each one seriously and never try to shame a student for what they believe or don't understand. Galiatsatos said they're not there to argue: They're there to arm students with the science they need to become ambassadors for public health.
So far, the more than 160 student volunteers of the Johns Hopkins Health Education and Training Corps, also known as the HEAT Corps, have logged more than 2,200 sessions in some 200 classrooms, with several in Baltimore and others as far away as Guatemala, India and Sudan. Galiatsatos visits more on his own, including a recent stop at Navajo Preparatory School in New Mexico, where he helped answer parents' questions about booster shots and how to safely gather during the winter holidays.
A joint venture of Hopkins-affiliated researchers, clinicians and educators, the HEAT Corps curriculum launched in July 2020, and has been revised and compressed in the months since. It's funded with annual contributions of $200,000 from Johns Hopkins University and $100,000 from Hopkins Health System, and it received a two-year, $300,000 per year grant from the Baltimore City Health Department in July to deliver the curriculum across the city's public school system.
The idea stemmed from the number of teachers calling on Galiatsatos for help during the initial months of the pandemic as school buildings closed and students expressed worry over how long they would be stuck at home. He had existing relationships with schools from his work with Medicine for Greater Good and had previously visited classrooms to talk about topics such as lung health and air pollution. Now, could he come back and explain this new world to them?
In Nutsugah's classroom, it takes a couple minutes and a bit of charm, but Galiatsatos soon captivates the students. Through fist bumps, jokes and kid-friendly analogies, he earns their attention. By the end of class, nearly every student had spoken up.
At this point, he's an expert at teaching kids about COVID-19. Since the coronavirus arrived in early 2020, he has visited - virtually or in person - more than 200 classrooms to challenge students to think about how they can advocate for public health.
"So, you're here to convince us to get the vaccine?" asks Priyasha Morris, who sits near the front of Nutsugah's classroom.
No, Galiatsatos says. But that doesn't mean they're off the hook.
"I was invited by your teacher to help you do something no other generation has done before," he said, daring them to think of themselves as characters in a Marvel movie. "What role can you play, right now, to end the pandemic?"
"Wow," a student responds.
Annette Anderson, assistant professor at Hopkins' school of education, helped design the COVID-19 curriculum.
"We are fond of saying, we built the plane while we were flying it," she said. "We were parsing it out to make it appropriate, but also being responsive because we were all trying to figure it out at the same time."
Anderson said keeping up with the pandemic's latest twists and turns poses a challenge for the HEAT Corps, which updated the curriculum at the beginning of the school year with more information about variants, for instance. The curriculum designers engage in lively debates about what to include and what to omit, what qualifies as too graphic and what's age-appropriate for children, she said.
The curriculum shouldn't be considered a "catchall," Anderson said. For example, it briefly touches on the theory that the coronavirus likely developed out of animal-to-human contact, known as "zoonotic" spread, one of the curriculum's vocabulary words.
Though the virus' zoonotic spread theory has not been proven definitively - even some federal officials in the U.S. contend the virus could have been developed and accidentally released from a lab in Wuhan, China - Anderson said the designers consulted their experts and stuck to what they considered the most plausible and scientifically sound scenario.
"We've had to be very careful with how our product aligns, or hews, with certain ideologies," she said. "We've been intentionally clear about what our program does and doesn't do."
Galiatsatos also instructs HEAT Corps volunteers to be honest about their own knowledge gaps. That helps lessen some of the pressure associated with teaching such a contentious topic, said Ndeye Silla, a graduate student working toward her master's degree at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who led a virtual session for third to fifth grade students in October at St. Jerome Regional School in northeastern Pennsylvania.
It can be difficult to engage students remotely, said Silla, especially about a virus that continues to evolve.
"It's important to be honest and explain it as best we can," she said. "I say, 'Even though I'm telling you this information, it could change. I know it's hard to understand. Even for adults, it's complicated.' "
Silla and co-leader Britney Murray's session at the Catholic school covered the basics: what COVID-19 is and how it got its name, how it spreads and what can be done to blunt its impact. They used visual aids to demonstrate what a "superspreader" event looks like, reviewed vocabulary words such as "contact tracing," "herd immunity," and "self care," and explained the differences between the three vaccines available in the U.S.
When Silla and Murray opened the floor to questions, kids took turns raising their hands and sharing the problems they had been gaming out in their heads. The questions ranged from the practical ("If you get the vaccine, can you still get the virus?") to the hypothetical ("What would happen if you can't tell you're sick, but you go get the vaccine?")
Even for such young kids, some of their concerns mirrored those of adults.
"What if you have the virus, and then you touch your friend?" one girl asked.
"What happens if you spread the virus, and you don't know if you spread it?" another boy questioned.
Murray encouraged the students to apply the information they had learned about social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing, which she and Silla emphasized repeatedly.
"It seems like we're saying a lot of the same things, but these things are really powerful," she told the class.
With some of the older kids, the questions sometimes veered into more challenging territory.
During a session with sixth, seventh and eighth graders at St. Jerome Regional, one student asked why people had to wear masks after "20 years of research" showing that they don't stop the transmission of viruses.
"Viruses are smaller than spit and germs," the student said. "It's like throwing sand through a chain-link fence."
The co-leaders of that session, Chanel Lee and Barath Biyyala, said that research shows masks do reduce virus transmission, especially if everyone in a close-contact situation wears them and they're fitted properly to people's faces.
"When you wear face masks, it minimizes viral load," Lee said. "They actually do protect you and other people from getting the virus."
Added Biyyala: "We're confident about the effectiveness of masks."
For some questions, the volunteers acknowledged that there were no easy answers. One student asked why she never contracted COVID-19, even though her parents did; another wanted to know how much longer they'd have to wear masks.
At Baltimore Design School, students asked if the vaccines contained tracking devices, if they could rewrite a person's genetic material and if they could cause cerebral palsy.
No, no and no, Galiatsatos responded, cautioning the kids to be skeptical and trust science's limitations.
"As long as there are human beings, there will be other humans that will want to pump out misinformation and keep others from doing the right thing," he said. "You always got to be careful what you read."
But among children of all age groups, no matter what school they attended, where they lived, or how they thought about COVID-19 and the vaccines, there was one question that united them, coming up again and again: They want to know when the pandemic will be over.

"As long as there are human beings, there will be other humans that will want to pump out misinformation and keep others from doing the right thing," he said. "You always got to be careful what you read."
But among children of all age groups, no matter what school they attended, where they lived, or how they thought about COVID-19 and the vaccines, there was one question that united them, coming up again and again: They want to know when the pandemic will be over.

Full text: Baltimore attempts to bridge disparate views of coronavirus vaccination
BALTIMORE - While canvassing for a coronavirus vaccination clinic on Baltimore's Pennsylvania Avenue, James Green met a woman who chastised him for wasting his time.
"That's the White man's vaccine," she told him this summer. "They're trying to wipe us off the face of the Earth."
It wasn't the first time Green, 23, heard that sentiment in his role as a vaccine ambassador for the city health department. The west Baltimore resident said he understands where it's coming from.
"A lot of the hesitation is ingrained, even in my generation," Green said.
After the coronavirus vaccines became available, demand was initially strong, while supplies ran scarce.
Health officials knew that demand would ease and many people still would need convincing to get inoculated and help stop the pandemic. They launched a messaging campaign, including prominent Marylanders such as sports figures, celebrities, community leaders and politicians rolling up their sleeves and spreading the word that the vaccines were safe and effective for all.
Yet the number of people getting the shots now has dropped off. About 32 percent of the U.S. population hasn't been vaccinated, according to national data. And several studies found that those who remain hesitant, reluctant or dismissive about getting vaccinated were more likely to distrust institutions such as hospitals, government officials and the news media. That meant that they wouldn't necessarily respond well to messaging campaigns pushed out by recognized figures.
At the same time, disinformation and misinformation about the vaccines continued to circulate largely unchecked across the country, targeting individuals who remain unvaccinated or on the fence.
The Baltimore City Health Department and others are attempting to remedy the disparate views by deploying an army of "vaccine ambassadors" such as Green into neighborhoods and communities, redefining what a "trusted messenger" looks like and who qualifies as one.
These messengers - ranging from full-time students to retired adults - are tasked with communicating the benefits of coronavirus vaccinations to those they meet and sharing the information people need to make informed decisions.
The process is slow and time-consuming, but more one-on-one engagement will help dispel some of the myths and misconceptions standing in the way of eligible populations and the vaccines, said Kendra McDow, chief medical officer for the health department.
McDow said ambassadors answer any questions people have about the safety, development and efficacy of the vaccines. They don't, however, push the shots with anyone expressing reluctance.
She acknowledged that some of the distrust that exists in Baltimore and elsewhere is valid and stems from personal or historical examples of abuse in the medical system.
Since the city hired ambassadors, the percentage of vaccinated individuals has risen each week, she said. Ambassadors have logged more than 12,000 unique conversations with people since the program started over the summer, according to the latest figures from the department. That includes canvassing, setting up information tables, staffing events, and having conversations over the phone and text messages.
The city health department employs 88 ambassadors who work 15 hours a week at a rate of $20 an hour. They are employed through a contract the department has with Morgan State University that is expected to be covered by funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
"We know this is a marathon," McDow said. "It's slow and steady."
Green is a University of Maryland School of Nursing student who coordinates outreach to young men in Baltimore as part of the health department's VALUE ambassador program.
VALUE ambassadors - shorthand for Vaccine Acceptance and Access Lives in Unity, Education and Engagement - target a range of potential vaccine recipients, including young adults; pregnant and lactating individuals; older adults; members of Black, Latino and Orthodox Jewish communities; people experiencing homelessness; people with disabilities; and immigrants.
Green said vaccine hesitation among young men of color often correlates with age.
"The scary part about young people in that age range is that they don't do their research, and a lot of times it becomes, 'What did I hear on the street?' " Green said.
Young men who are a bit older, he said, tend to think they're invincible against the virus - a misconception fueled by the fallacy that covid-19 affects only older adults. Even as the delta variant increasingly sickens younger patients and sends more children to the hospital, many of the young men Green interacts with remain ambivalent about protecting themselves, he said.
"I think we're still stuck in that egocentric, 'Well, it won't happen to me,' attitude," said Green, a Morgan State University graduate.
While Green acknowledged that many young Black men have rejected his efforts, he has scored some wins. He said it helps that the ambassadors appear at the same time and same locations each week, which helps establish trust. For recurring clinics at Coppin State University and the Druid Hill Farmers Market, the ambassadors spread out on foot into the surrounding neighborhoods.
Green likened his group of vaccine ambassadors to "party promoters." But they can't each rely on a script to "promote" the clinics, he said. The conversations have to be personal, genuine and authentic.
"It's tricky, right? Because if you try to talk to someone about changing their behavior, even if they have a maladaptive thought process behind the change, it's not good for you to outright directly challenge that," he said. "Because once you [invalidate] someone's belief … they're going to stop listening to everything you say.
"So, I meet them in the middle. I say, 'Hey, I thought the same thing. I still have those reservations sometimes. But let me tell you something: This is not designed to hurt you. This is designed to help you.' "
When Kathleen Page left Latin America in the 1990s to study medicine in the United States, she figured she'd return south with her medical degree someday. But instead of going home, she settled in Baltimore and focused on serving the Latino community as an infectious-disease physician.
The associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is one of more than a dozen ambassadors promoted by the state health department's GoVAX program. She spends two days a week visiting clinics throughout the Baltimore area, urging fellow Spanish speakers to get vaccinated. On a recent Sunday, Page brought her knowledge to Fiesta Baltimore, an annual celebration of Latino culture, in Patterson Park.
Page said most people she encounters through the state's outreach program eventually agree to get vaccinated. Many people have ill-informed perceptions about side effects they could experience after getting the shots, she said. Also, she has convinced pregnant people that the data overwhelmingly supports them getting vaccinated.
"Having a doctor that speaks Spanish is very, very reassuring to some people," said Page, whose family is from Uruguay. She distilled her philosophy to three pillars: "Right place, right time, right language."
Page estimates that about 10 percent of the people who refuse to get vaccinated do so because of religious beliefs. She doesn't try to talk them out of their convictions, she said. But she does answer questions and offers people the number for the coronavirus hotline of the Esperanza Center, an immigrant resource center, so they can talk it over further.
The more contagious delta variant, along with vaccine mandates in workplaces, have been motivating more people to seek out vaccinations, Page said. As the numbers continue to rise, she thinks more people will let their guard down and get the shots.
"The most influential thing is seeing others get vaccinated," Page said. "They saw their neighbors and friends get it, and they were fine."
Willietta Gombeh-Fonjungo has heard all the myths since joining Baltimore health officials in city neighborhoods through a program called Baltimore Health Corps: "The covid-19 vaccine makes you more sick than the disease." "It alters your DNA." "It tracks your whereabouts."
She spends her days delivering real information, and some reassurance, to people who remain hesitant to get vaccinated. The program is a ready force of about two dozen community health workers and supervisors. It's been trained with the assistance of Johns Hopkins University's Jhpiego, an international nonprofit health-care organization, and other groups.
The 24-year-old joined the effort not long after moving to Baltimore from New Jersey with her new husband and her new degree in public health. She was from a family of nurses and eager to get on the front lines - in this case outside, on sidewalks, in neighborhoods.
Now a site supervisor, she leads canvassing teams that hand out fliers about vaccination clinics, answer questions and debunk the persistent misinformation that keeps people from getting shots.
"The number one thing I do is dispel all of the things people hear," she said at a recent clinic at a city high school, where the inaccurate refrains were that the coronavirus doesn't infect kids or their cases are never that bad.
Gombeh-Fonjungo said she often visits the same places multiple times, approaching the same people, and she hopes, making them trust her.
She feels fulfilled each time it works, like when a security guard at a grocery store finally agreed to a shot.
She once approached a half-dozen men outside a library with a big smile and an offer to answer questions about the vaccine. All refused, though one said his mother wouldn't let him visit until he got a shot. Gombeh-Fonjungo asked whether he understood that his vaccination would protect her, too.
After some follow-up questions answered by a nurse, and Gombeh-Fonjungo offering to hold his hand through the process, the man not only got the shot, but talked another friend into doing it, too.
"It's become personal," she said. "We clap when people get vaccinated."

Full text: Mom Sasha Taylor knew Arnoldo would scream and writhe in her arms, that Acia, who uses a wheelchair, would tense up, and that Alea would try to comfort them both.
But after all the drama, Taylor was serene.
Six-hundred and six days after the District recorded its first coronavirus case, her children received their first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
"I just want to make sure me and my family are safe," said Taylor, 32, of Takoma.
Her son, 9, and twin girls, 10, were among the first children in their age group in the nation to be vaccinated Wednesday at a Children's National Hospital clinic after federal authorities late Tuesday cleared the way for use of the coronavirus vaccine in 5-to-11-year-olds.
Acia, who has cerebral palsy and a host of conditions including chronic lung disease and epilepsy, was hospitalized for 14 days in the spring with covid-19 and pneumonia — a stay she had to endure alone after Taylor tested positive for the coronavirus, too.
"I don't even think she would make it if she were to get sick again. It was really hard on her," Taylor said. "It was hard on both of us."
Children's National Hospital providers have identified about 24,000 children who have complex diagnoses and live in neighborhoods hit hard by the pandemic, such as Wards 7 and 8 in the District, and Prince George's County, Md. They will be offered the vaccine first, through primary care offices, specialized clinics and mobile units.
Disparities in access to medical care, housing and food insecurity as well as lower uptake of the vaccine generally make children in some parts of the region more vulnerable to the coronavirus , which has disproportionately impacted Black and Latino communities.
Vaccinations began Wednesday as parents around the country and in D.C., Maryland and Virginia who are eager to get their elementary school children vaccinated scoured websites in search of appointments — often booking later than they had hoped, if at all.
Locally, public health officials advised parents to check Vaccines.gov, pediatrics offices, state and local health departments and pharmacies. It may take a few days for registration systems to go live as providers receive vaccine specially formulated and packaged for children 5 to 11, they say.
DC Health on Friday will host pop-up vaccine clinics at Takoma Community Center in Ward 4 (300 Van Buren Street NW) and Fort Stanton Recreation Center in Ward 8 (1812 Erie Street SE). Parents or guardians can bring their children between 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. and appointments will not be necessary. The vaccine is always free.
In the coming days and weeks, vaccine will be available at more than 60 pharmacies, hospitals and health centers across the District, as well as one-time clinics in schools and recreation centers in every ward between Nov. 8 and 20, officials said.
Community health clinics, like Mary's Center, which Mayor Muriel E. Bowser visited Wednesday, are also administering vaccine to 5-to-11-year-olds.
At the Children's National Shepherd Park clinic on Wednesday, Rachael Brown, 38, snuggled her 5-year-old son, Ben Hayes, and took a selfie with him before he got the jab. He has had nine surgeries since birth due to a vascular malformation.
"This is a big deal for my family," she said.
As federal officials gave the vaccine the green light for use in kids 5 to 11 Tuesday night, Brown tracked the process on Twitter and texted her mom group chat: "Ben's getting vaccinated tomorrow!"
About one-third of parents were eager to get their children vaccinated as soon as they were eligible, national polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows, but as of September, one third said they would wait and see, and another third would not get their kids vaccinated, or would do so only if required. Public health experts and officials are working hard to try to overcome the politicization of mitigation efforts and disinformation about the vaccines.
Sarah Schaffer DeRoo, a Children's National pediatrician who studies vaccine hesitancy, said parents have questions about safety and side effects and worry the process may have been rushed or influenced by politics. A history of racist practices in the medical establishment may also stoke mistrust in the Black community, she said. White rural communities have also been slow to embrace the vaccines, data shows.
The reality of the virus has been impossible for Carolyn Talley, 68, of Southeast to ignore. She home-schools her adopted sons Damontae Richardson-Talley, 9, and Gilberto Talley, 11, who has had four heart surgeries and has a pacemaker.
Talley's older sister died of covid-19 in Florida at age 71, and her three granddaughters, who are in their 20s and live in D.C., believe vaccine conspiracy theories.
"I pray," she said, "and pray that God protect them and they wake up soon."
New infections have been on the decline across the region for weeks, with the seven-day average down to 2,090, nearly half of what it was a month ago, data shows.
Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Wednesday said the state will soon send text messages to parents and run TV ads designed to get the message out about the latest eligibility group.
"We have a chance to give our kids their lives back," said Monique Soileau-Burke, vice president of the Maryland Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, who joined Hogan at a news conference.
Danny Avula, Virginia's vaccine coordinator and a pediatrician, said parents may wonder whether their younger children need to be vaccinated when only mild disease is typical if they get infected. The state recorded a fivefold increase in pediatric hospitalizations with the onset of the delta variant, he said.
One-on-one conversations are most effective at quelling vaccine concerns, he said.
"As we've seen at every step of the vaccine rollout, this all comes back to trusted messengers. We know for families, pediatricians are the ones that have that trusted voice when it comes to health outcomes," Avula told reporters Wednesday.
Taylor, the mom of three, said she jumped at the chance to get her children vaccinated over the objections of her family.
"A lot of my family and friends, they are opposed to it. If my family were to know that I got them vaccinated, a lot of them would be upset. Because there's so many stories and stuff going around about it," she said. "But I'd rather them be safe than anything."

Full text: Pr. George's launches door-to-door effort in hard-hit neighborhoods
Officials in the region are continuing to grapple with how to get more people vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, with those in Prince George's County urging residents to take the shots and Gov. Larry Hogan (R) announcing a new campaign to improve vaccine uptake rates at nursing homes.
Residents in the hard-hit Washington suburb of Prince George's spent months clamoring for the vaccine, waiting in long lines, dealing with technological glitches and watching as residents from other jurisdictions snagged appointments in the county.
But County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) said there has been a shift in Prince George's and across the region: With vaccinations now "easier than ever to get," the challenge is reaching residents who have not yet gotten their shots.
"We are looking for you if you are unvaccinated," Alsobrooks said at a news conference Tuesday. "We believe so strongly that this is the way forward for our community."
As the District did this weekend, Prince George's has launched a door-to-door canvassing program that will try to reach people in hard-hit neighborhoods inside the Capital Beltway, where vaccination rates are lowest. Canvassers will knock on more than 266,000 doors in a dozen communities that have been identified by the county's equity task force as both hard-hit by the virus and having issues related to vaccine access, including poverty, Alsobrooks said.
For example, in the 20743 Zip code, which includes Capitol Heights and is one of the targeted communities, just 35 percent of residents have received at least one shot. Meanwhile, in the 20721 Zip code, which includes the much wealthier Bowie, 62 percent of residents have gotten at least one shot, according to county data.
And like in D.C., which transitioned this month from using a preregistration system to hosting 11 walk-up clinics with no appointments required, residents in Prince George's are no longer required to preregister at health department or state-run mass vaccination sites. The county is also working with a variety of community partners to host mobile clinics at sites including churches and community groups.
But Alsobrooks said that at a walk-up vaccination clinic hosted by the county Monday at Wayne K. Curry Sports and Learning Center in Landover, only 160 of the 500 available doses were used.
"We communicated on every platform we had, urging people to please come to the walk-up clinic," she said. "What we learned is this: Demand has not kept pace as the covid-19 vaccine has become more widely available. . . . Boosting demand is a top priority for our county."
Officials elsewhere have been trying to increase access to the vaccine. In Virginia, Arlington officials announced Tuesday that they would offer walk-up clinics to individuals 16 and up without appointments, while Loudoun County launched a free shuttle service between the bus stop at Dulles Town Center and the county's vaccination site located at the other end of the shopping mall. The shuttle will operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day the vaccine site is open.
In addition to the in-person door-knocking in Prince George's, there will also be phone and text banking encouraging county residents to get vaccinated, Alsobrooks said. Canvassers will make 1.3 million calls and send 500,000 texts.
Hogan on Tuesday announced that the state is expanding its outreach campaign and deploying more mobile vaccine units with a target of reaching employees and residents of nursing homes, who were prioritized in late December when vaccinations first became available. They were among the some of the groups who have shown hesitancy about getting a shot.
Hogan said he has signed an executive order that will require nursing homes to report their vaccination rates and the information on each facility will be available online.
Hogan, who on Monday announced a plan to offer $100 to any fully vaccinated state employee, encouraged nursing-home owners to provide an incentive to their employees.
Hogan said the "disinformation campaign" about vaccination continues to be a challenge as the state tries to convince those who have taken a wait-and-see attitude or are opposed to getting immunized.
"Those who are not vaccinated will continue to be at risk of infection, hospitalization and death," he said at a Baltimore County nursing home. "We've got to get everybody convinced to stop this thing and get back to normal."
In response to the news that the federal government is reallocating doses it sends to states based on need, Hogan said he does not expect to see the numbers change much in Maryland.
"We anticipate using and getting our full share," he said.
Hogan added that the state is "anxiously waiting" for a decision from the Food and Drug Administration to allow children aged 12 to 15 to receive the vaccine.
He said there are about 455,000 preteens and teenagers in that category, and when eligibility opens, the state will "proceed with them right away."
The number of new coronavirus cases have been on a downward trend in the region. Maryland on Tuesday reported 501 new cases and six deaths, while the District reported 83 new cases and no deaths. Virginia reported 771 new cases and 16 deaths.

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
Welcome to The Daily 202 newsletter ! Today, we look at what President Biden promised in his first prime-time speech. But don't miss the latest on the administration's first talks with China, and the efforts to get millions more vaccinated. Send me links to politics or policy stories you think deserve more attention! And tell your friends to sign up here .
President Biden promised in his first prime-time address last night to own it if the sweeping rescue package he signed hours earlier falls short of its ambitious goals of smothering the pandemic and breathing new life into the economy.
Speaking from the East Room of the White House 50 days after taking office, Biden promised the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan would fund initiatives to "beat the virus and create millions of jobs."
And the president, simultaneously taking both credit and responsibility, declared: "If it fails at any point, I will acknowledge that it failed."
“But it will not,” he promised.
Biden has generally set, and met,realistic goals in his first 50 days. But the promises he made in his speech — even as heavily qualified as they were — come with political risks should he fall short. Think "Mission Accomplished," "you'll be able to keep your doctor," or predicting coronavirus cases will soon be "close to zero."
The White House had previewed the biggest news from the speech.
As my colleague Sean Sullivan wrote:
"President Biden on Thursday directed states to ensure that all adults are eligible for thecoronavirusvaccine by May 1, and he declared a goal of allowing small celebrations on July 4, setting up significant landmarks in the effort to return to normalcy after the devastating pandemic."
At the New York Times,Michael Shear put it this way:
"President Biden on Thursday evening directed states to make all adult Americans eligible to receive coronavirus vaccines no later than May 1, using a somber but hopeful prime-time address to the nation to say Americans may be able to 'mark our independence from this virus' by the Fourth of July."
As Agence France-Presse's Sebastian Smith saw it:
"President Joe Biden on Thursday offered his COVID-weary nation a tantalizing glimpse of an almost normal July 4th, outlining in a speech how the United States can defeat the coronavirus if people stay united on prevention measures and get vaccinated."
Here areLauren Egan, Kristen Welker and Shannon Pettypiece of NBC News:
"President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he will direct states to make all adults eligible forcoronavirusvaccinations no later than May 1, a move that he said could help the United States return to some sense of normalcy by Independence Day."
Univision also highlighted May 1 and July 4:
"El mandatario planteó dos fechas específicas para marcar el camino a la normalidad: el 1 de mayo y el 4 de julio,el Día de la Independencia, cuando promete que los estadounidenses (si la ciencia lo permitey los CDC lo aconsejan) podrán reunirse con familias y amigos para los tradicionales asados y festividades de la jornada."
Whereas former president Donald Trump one year ago pushed for "packed churches" by Easter, Biden instead was more modest but no less concrete in his ambitions. Biden envisioned small groups of families and friends gathered to "not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virus."
By picking a date by which Americans can judge whether their lives are back to normal, and by claiming personal responsibility for the rescue package's success, Biden has set precise benchmarks to which voters can hold him.
Biden opened his remarks with transparent swipes at Trump — not by name — for what he described as deadly early missteps in confronting the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 530,000 people in the United States.
"A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked, denials for days, weeks, then months," he said. "That led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness."
Trump regularly, and falsely, portrayed the coronavirusas no worse than the flu; later admitted he had deliberately beenplaying down the threat;condemned efforts to contain the virus by closing businesses; played down mask-wearing andonce famously declared "I don't take responsibility at all" for testing failures. Still, Biden has been taking credit for initiativeslaunched on Trump's watch andinflating his predecessor's failures.
Where Trump regularly blamed "the China virus" — he used the incendiary term, which some blame for violence against Asian Americans,as recently as Wednesday — Biden denounced "vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated."
“It's wrong. It's un-American. And it must stop,” he said.
And the president had strong words of warning, perhaps intended forstates easing lockdowns and mask-wearing mandates or Americans resisting steps like mask-wearing or social distancing.
"If we don't stay vigilant, and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track," Biden said. "We don't want to do that again. We've made so much progress. This is not the time to let up."
What’s happening nowTHE DAM IS BREAKING
The political winds are shifting, fast, in the Empire State where a slew of New York House Democrats – including Reps. Jerry Nadler, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jamaal Bowman, Grace Meng, and Mondaire Jones – called for Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign following accusations of sexual harassment. And Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee head Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) just released a statement calling on Cuomo to resign, saying "women deserve to be heard" and that the governor needs to be focused full-time on the battle to "crush" coronavirus.
All eyes are now on Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).
A majority of New York's House delegation has now called for Cuomo to step down and it seems like more statements are probably coming. "The repeated accusations against the governor, and the manner in which he has responded to them, have made it impossible for him to continue to govern at this point," Nadler said.
Jones said Cuomo is "unfit" to continue governing, adding his "mismanagement of covid-19 spread in nursing homes and subsequent attempt to cover it up cost lives and has decimated the public's faith in our state government."
"We believe these women, we believe the reporting, we believe the Attorney General, and we believe the fifty-five members of the New York State legislature, including the State Senate Majority Leader, who have concluded that Governor Cuomo can no longer effectively lead," Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman said.
New York Senate Deputy Majority Leader Mike Gianaris said the entire Long Island state Senate delegation agreed Cuomo should resign.
In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio also called on Cuomo to resign.Cuomo, he said, has shown a "pattern of cover up and a pattern of lies." "The governor must resign," he added, per the Times's Emma Fitzsimmons. "He can no longer do the job."
Context: Cuomo faces accusations of sexual harassment from six former employees.
But: not all state Democratic female officials are behind throwing Cuomo out before an investigation is complete, per a story by our Michael Scherer.
And: In the days after Cuomo was first accused by a former aide, "the governor's office called at least six former employees either to find out if they had heard from the accuser or to glean information about her in conversations that some said they saw as attempts to intimidate them," the Wall Street Journal reports.
Meanwhile, this Times reporter points out Cuomo has no public events for today on his schedule:
Attention Trumpworld: Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney leading an investigation into Trump's businesses, will not run for reelection.Vance's departure means Trump will likely face a new adversary, The New York Times's Jonah Bromwich reports, since the investigation will be left in a newcomer's hands. "The many candidates clamoring to replace him are, with few exceptions, seeking to fundamentally reshape the office," Bromwich writes about the eight-way race to replace Vance.
Biden will celebrate the passage of his $1.9 trillion relief package with a Rose Garden event with congressional Democrats today at 2:30 p.m.. Next week, the president embarks on a cross-country tour to sell the sweeping new law to Americans, John Wagner, Felicia Sonmez and Colby Itkowitz report.
Biden and Harris met virtually this morning with their counterparts in an alliance known as the Quad: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison; and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. "On this moment, it's a purpose that I think we all are concerned about. A free and open Indo-Pacific is essential to each of our futures, our countries," Biden said during the meeting, but neither he nor the other leaders directly discussed threats to maritime movement, economic expansion or diplomatic success posed by authoritarian China, Anne Gearan reports.
Suga will be the first foreign leader to visit Biden in person. The meeting demonstrates Biden's focus on rebuilding U.S. influence in Asia and rebuffing China, Anne Gearan reports. No date was announced for the visit, and an administration official said the details will be determined by progress against the pandemic.
ICE is asking officers to deploy to the border "as soon as this weekend" to care for soaring numbers of migrant families, teens and children.In an urgent email sent to senior staff last night, ICE asked for volunteers to quickly move to the border, where holding cells are crammed beyond capacity, Nick Miroff reports.

Lunchtime reads from The Post
"The billionaire boom,"by Nitasha Tiku and Jay Greene: "The wealth of nine of the country's top titans has increased by more than $360 billion in the past year. And they are all tech barons, underscoring the power of the industry in the U.S. economy. … The scrutiny of tech billionaires' wealth is also driven by the role their companies played during the pandemic. Social media including Facebook [run by Mark Zuckerberg] appeared to make the situation worse because it was used to spread disinformation … [Tesla CEO Elon] Musk railed against stay-at-home mandates … In [Jeff] Bezos's case, profits were possible in part because Amazon hired more than 500,000 workers to stow, sort, pick and pack goods in 2020, even as warehouse workers sounded alarms about safety."
"The Biden administration's first showdown with China,"by Ishaan Tharoor: "Next week in Alaska, top officials in the Biden administration are slated to have face-to-face meetings with Chinese counterparts. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will sit down with China's most senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and Chinese State Councilor Wang Yi next Thursday in Anchorage. … There are no high expectations for the Alaska talks."
… and beyond
"CDC's 'Huge Mistake': Did misguided mask advice drive up Covid death toll for health workers?" by Kaiser Health News's Christina Jewett: "Since the start of the pandemic, the most terrifying task in health care was thought to be when a doctor put a breathing tube down the trachea of a critically ill covid patient. Those performing such 'aerosol-generating' procedures, often in an intensive care unit, got the best protective gear even if there wasn't enough to go around, per CDC guidelines. And for anyone else working with covid patients, until a month ago, a surgical mask was considered sufficient. A new wave of research now shows that several of those procedures were not the most hazardous. Recent studies have determined that a basic cough produces about 20 times more particles than intubation."
"The one union Biden has not supported,"by the American Prospect's Marcia Brown: "The National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), a union that represents the nation's 500 judges, outspokenly opposed the [Trump] administration's efforts at every turn. In 2019, the Trump administration moved to decertify the immigration judges' union … The union is hopeful that President Biden will reverse the decision, but they have yet to see action."
"How four business owners persevered through the pandemic,"by the Washington City Paper's Laura Hayes: "When Sunyatta Amen opened Calabash Tea & Tonic in 2015, she envisioned it as a modern-day apothecary. … The pandemic decimated Calabash's revenue, but the business survived thanks to a Paycheck Protection Program loan, a shift to e-commerce, and teaming up with other local businesses … to sell goods … Closing [a location in] Shaw was an easy call for Amen because the shop is tight and the windows don't open. 'I was concerned about my staff and their families,' she says. '… We don't want to kill grandma trying to catch a dollar.'"
The first 100 daysStimulus checks are expected to start landing in Americans’ bank accounts this weekend.
That is according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who said Americans can expect the "first wave" of checks in the next few days and that they will continue flowing over "the next several weeks."
Michelle Singletary, our personal finance columnist, writes those who've filed their 2019 or 2020 tax returns and received a refund should be the first in line to get a payment, since the IRS has their direct deposit information.
But, but, but: An overworked IRS — which is currently in the middle of tax season — could lead to a backlog in processing both tax returns and stimulus checks. As Lisa Rein reported in January, the pandemic has "magnified critical weaknesses" in an agency plagued by "old technology and understaffing."
And while the checks are coming soon, for some, it is too late — and not enough.
"No state's work force has been battered as badly by the coronavirus pandemic as Nevada's, and people are especially struggling in Las Vegas," reports the New York Times's Jennifer Medina. Because of the state's heavy reliance on tourism, service industry workers have gone months without stable incomes. MaryAnn Bautista, a hotel worker and a "single mother of five … [who has] received unemployment checks within weeks … said she would spend her stimulus money stocking up on food and helping her children out with their bills. 'We appreciate the help,' she said of the government aid. 'Don't get me wrong. We do appreciate that, but we cannot rely on it. We want job assurance.' "
States with Republican governors had the highest covid-19 incidence and death rates over the summer, per a new study.
A new study by Johns Hopkins University and the Medical University of South Carolina found that, "the per-capita rates of new COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths were higher in states with Democrat governors in the first months of the pandemic last year, but became much higher in states with Republican governors by mid-summer and through 2020."
"For death rates, Republican-led states had lower rates early in the pandemic, but higher rates from July 4 through mid-December," researchers found.
The U.S. is sitting on tens of millions of vaccine doses that the rest of the world needs.
Doses of the vaccine made by AstraZeneca "are sitting idly in American manufacturing facilities, awaiting results from its U.S. clinical trial while countries that have authorized its use beg for access," the Times's Noah Weiland and Rebecca Robbins report. At least 30 million doses are waiting approval in Ohio, and a company in Maryland has produced enough vaccine for tens of millions more doses.
"AstraZeneca has asked the Biden administration to let it loan American doses to the European Union, where it has fallen short of its original supply commitments and where the vaccination campaign has stumbled badly," Weiland and Robbins write. "The administration, for now, has denied the request."
What’s next for Democrats? Confronting the filibuster.
"Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and his fellow Senate Democrats now face a pivotal decision: What's next for the filibuster? On one hand, Democrats are under pressure to deliver on key priorities for their party's liberal base, and the House has begun to stack partisan bills at the Senate's door. On the other hand, some Democratic senators are hoping to embrace a more bipartisan mode of lawmaking," Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report.
While the Senate is expected to spend the rest of March filling out Biden's Cabinet, it will take up new legislative business in April — and Schumer has already said he is committed to passing a "big bold agenda," and he is not waiting for Republicans.
Republicans haven't yet blocked a Democratic bill in the evenly split Senate, but "a large and growing number of Democrats are itching for a fight" — including Schumer.
Remember the holdouts:Sens. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Krysten Sinema (Ariz.) are the two Democrats who will oppose eliminating the filibuster — at least for now. "While Manchin has openly pondered changes to the rule, Sinema recently told constituents in a letter that she supported preserving it as a means to 'protect what the Senate was designed to be.' "
What’s next for Biden? Immigration and infrastructure.
"The White House so far has not said what Biden will turn to next as part of his legislative agenda," Kim reports. But Psaki signaled both immigration and infrastructure are top priorities. Whatever Biden's next plans may be, they are already running into trouble.
On infrastructure: "The White House has declined to say whether Biden would be open to the fast-track parliamentary measure used for coronavirus relief — called reconciliation — on infrastructure, with officials noting that the president hasn't even proposed a bill. But two of the most influential forces in the Senate Democratic caucus are colliding on strategy. [Manchin] is insisting that Democrats avoid using reconciliation on infrastructure … [While] Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) … signaled that doing so would be the only way of getting a meaningful infrastructure package accomplished."
On immigration:"The prospects of Biden's immigration bill surviving through Congress intact appear increasingly bleak. House Democratic leaders have privately started to gauge the level of support for the president's plan — formally called the U.S. Citizenship Act — and found that, at this point, it would struggle to pass. … Many lawmakers also feel that such a massive overhaul is moving too quickly in the House, while moderates fear supporting controversial legislation that has no real path in the Senate."
Biden's immigration goals still have a lifeline:"While they sort through internal dynamics on the broader overhaul, House Democratic leaders will move smaller, more targeted legislation that would offer a pathway to citizenship for beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and immigrants who have been shielded from deportation under temporary protected status. House Democrats will also pass legislation that offers green cards to farmworkers who don't have legal status."
Biden's immigration plan would eventually allow most undocumented immigrants to become citizens.Daniela Santamariña, Danielle Rindler and Joe Fox explain how:

Sanders is bringing the Amazon union battle to D.C. Sanders, Budget Committee chair, called on Jennifer Bates, a union-supporting worker from Amazon's warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., to testify next week on income inequality.
More than 5,800 employees in that Amazon facility are in the middle of a major union drive. Sanders also called on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to testify. "What you are seeing right now in Bessemer is an example of the richest person in this country spending a whole lot of money to make it harder for ordinary working people to live with dignity and safety," Sanders told Jay Greene. Bezos had not replied to the request to testify by yesterday afternoon, Sanders said. (Bezos owns The Post).

Tucker Carlson is now feuding with the Pentagon.This week, Carlson criticized Biden's announcement that the military is developing new uniforms to accommodate women's hairstyles and pregnancies. "So we've got new hairstyles and maternity flight suits," said Carlson, per the New York Post. "Pregnant women are going to fight our wars. It's a mockery of the US military."
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby pushed back against Carlson's comments, saying the military "is the greatest the world has ever seen because of its diversity. "What we absolutely won't do is take personnel advice from a talk show host or the Chinese military. Maybe those folks feel like they have something to prove — that's on them," he said.

The bad news is we're gaining on it a few yards at a time

-Good morning. I'm Jonathan Capehart,
opinion writer for The Washington Post.
Welcome to Washington Post Live and welcome
to Washington Post Live's special series
"Coronavirus: Leadership During Crisis."
And there's no better person to talk to about the pandemic
or leadership than Andy Slavitt,
White House senior advisor to the COVID-19 Response Team.
Mr. Slavitt, welcome to Washington Post Live.
-Thanks, Jonathan. Good to be here.
-So, President Biden
was supposed to go to Michigan today --
that trip has been pushed off to Friday --
to visit a Pfizer vaccine manufacturing plant,
to recognize the employees.
This particular Pfizer plant
has been the central hub for distributing the vaccine.
Could you start this morning by giving us
the latest information on the president's plans
for vaccine production and distribution?
-Sure. Well, it's good to be with everybody this morning.
I think we came into office,
I think we were --
the assessment we did was that
there was no standing inventory and we did not have
enough vaccines or vaccinators or locations
for people to get vaccinated that were set up.
So the president did a few things.
The first thing he did was he
directed us to purchase enough vaccines
to get every American vaccinated as quickly as possible.
And, as he announced last week,
we have enough vaccines to vaccinate Americans
by the end of July, right now.
That does not account for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine
and it's important to tell you why.
We are going to let the FDA make the determination
and not assume anything, and I think it's important.
This is part of letting science lead
and not having the White House push from the side.
So there are opportunities for things to go better.
But, like this week's weather proves,
there's also plenty of surprises in store,
so we are trying to plan for every event
and we're trying to be conservative and cautious.
Over the first three or four weeks --
I can't even remember how long we've been here, now --
We've increased supply to states by 58%, of vaccines.
We have significantly increased the number of vaccinators,
bringing retired workers, retired doctors, retired nurses,
active military, FEMA personnel, out into the field.
We've opened up community vaccination centers,
particularly in hard-hit communities
and communities that are typically ignored.
We've started distributing to retail pharmacies.
Again, 6,500 pharmacy locations,
weighted towards lower-income communities.
So it's been a flurry of activities.
I think today we can sit here and say
it's not fast enough for the public.
It's not fast enough for what we'd like,
but we've now got the ability
to make sure we can vaccinate this country
and do it in the next number of months.
-In that answer, you've given a lot of ground to cover,
in terms of follow-up, so let's start with the states.
How are states performing with vaccine distribution?
-The states are --
This is the requisite American flag pin
and it's got to be facing the right direction.
Sorry about that. -It's okay.
So when we got here, states had distributed
about 46% of the vaccines that had been delivered.
That's obviously too low
and that's a reflection of the fact that it was
a new process for people, that people were unsure
about whether or not they were going to get further doses.
There had been no commitments and very variable delivery.
Today, states have delivered close to about 75% of the doses,
so, from 46% to 75%.
There's still some variability.
Some states are above 80%, some states are below 70%.
But all the states are doing much, much, much better.
And part of it is just creating some assurance.
We've basically told the states that they will get
at least three weeks of visibility
into how many vaccines they'll get
and, if anything, we're going to try to beat those numbers.
We will never come below those numbers.
So making those commitments.
While I think people are often loath
to want to make commitments,
making them just makes the whole system go better.
Because, as you know, Jonathan, in a shortage,
which is what we're facing, what do people do?
They hoard.
And so, if you don't give them transparency,
they will hoard more.
So, by telling them, "We will promise you these deliveries,"
that actually allows people to give the vaccines out
that they are holding onto.
-In terms of distribution,
the National Guard is participating.
What role is the National Guard playing?
-So states have -- and we have gone, at the federal level
[indistinct] fund
the use of the National Guard in their states.
They are setting up vaccination sites.
They are vaccinating people.
They are essentially providing the arms and legs
and the workforce and the brainpower,
along with FEMA, along with over 1,000 active military
who are out there doing the same.
I just saw a video, a very touching video,
of some enlisted military
who had been deployed over to Iraq,
who were now being deployed in their own communities
to deliver vaccines to their neighborhood.
And the enlisted soldiers said that it was one
of the most meaningful
and surprising experiences that he's had.
And I think, hopefully, you know,
as we try to come out of this, people will realize
that everybody is part of the solution, in some way.
And it's very hard for people to sit home
and do nothing in the middle of a crisis,
but I think the president's vision is
to engage the public, engage all of government,
engage the private sector,
engage the nonprofit and charitable sector,
engage the churches, engage the religious,
engage mayors in the community,
and everybody will come out of this.
There's no possible way for the federal government
to do this alone.
-Well, speaking of engaging the public,
I'm wondering, how are you dealing with vaccine hesitancy,
particularly in communities of color?
-Yeah. So, vaccine hesitancy, you know, essentially,
I think I define it this way --
people who have questions, legitimate questions,
about whether or not they should take a vaccine.
And, if we don't treat them as legitimate questions
that deserve legitimate, straightforward answers,
then we will lose people.
So, you know, it's all well and good
and I think there will be important messaging
and consistent messaging about how safe the vaccines are
and so forth, but that's not the answer.
The answer is a dialogue.
It's a dialogue in communities of color, about their concerns.
It's a dialogue with younger people
who may have their own issues.
It's a dialogue of anybody who has questions.
And what we're finding is that many people --
the first time, there are a lot of people
that would crawl over broken glass to get the vaccine.
There are plenty of other people
who are interested in taking the vaccine,
but they want to see others go first.
They may be more vaccine curious,
may be a good term for them.
And those folks, I think, over the last couple of months,
are increasingly moving over to the camp of,
"Well, I think I want to do this."
But talking to your local doctor,
your local physician, your church leader,
people you trust,
are really important parts of that dialogue,
and then, getting reliable answers.
Sadly, in this day and age,
there is enough misinformation out there that just occurs
and then there's enough disinformation out there
which people spark, and those rumors
can fly around and really, really hurt the cause.
We just want to get people
straight answers to their questions
and I think that gives me confidence
that, if we can answer people's questions,
because these vaccines are so safe and so effective,
we think more and more people will come on.
But it's a very good question, Jonathan, because, today,
we're dealing with issues of,
"How do we get enough supply quickly enough?"
But that won't always be the challenge.
I think, in a number of months, it could flip on us
and we could actually be dealing with the question,
"How do we make people comfortable
that this is something they want to do?"
-And, you know, Mr. Slavitt, another part of the challenge --
so, on the one hand, you have vaccine hesitancy
as a challenge, but then, you have
the challenge from the opposite, from the other end,
and that might be where you could have communities of color
that are eager to get the vaccine
and, yet, they can't get the vaccine.
So, how are you dealing with the equity issues involved,
in terms of who actually gets the vaccine?
-Well, the one thing I've learned in healthcare is
the structural impediments based on race, primarily,
but also based on other factors --
income, location, et cetera.
But, very provably, with race exists
so that, if you do nothing, if you do nothing special,
you will have gross inequities.
And this is a perfect example of this.
You know, a pharmacy in a low-income neighborhood,
maybe in a Black community, has vaccines.
They open for those vaccines,
they have appointments that come online,
and people who are living far away,
in wealthy communities,
have plenty of --
kids with laptops and iPads and iPhones
that are jumping all over those appointments.
And so you can intend well,
you could put the vaccines in the right communities,
and then, you find you've got this effect where all
of these people are coming into these communities,
that have probably not been there,
ever or for a long time,
and getting in line ahead of folks
and taking those vaccines.
So my message is you have to actively take steps
to prevent this from happening.
Because, at the same time, the low-income communities
and communities of color are also communities
that have a higher proportion, as we know,
of death and hospitalization, largely occupationally.
And so, we have to fight against this.
We've created a Health Equity Task Force.
It is a top position
and we have a number of, not just strategies,
but operational activities --
getting mobile vans into communities,
distributing into federally qualified health centers,
requesting and instructing folks
to play a community navigator role
to help people find vaccines.
And reserving appointments
and having neighborhood pharmacies reserve appointments
for people from the community.
We have to do all of these things, and more.
And we have some good stories
of, when you do these things, it works.
We had an event in North Carolina.
The state put on an event
that disproportionately drew from low-income people
because they reserved the morning appointments
and provided transportation
and they went through the churches.
So, that's more work.
That's more work for people to do.
But you have to do that work because, otherwise,
we will just continue to vaccinate
the people who are just clamoring for it.
and, unfortunately, when you clamor for it,
you do clamor over other people
and we have to be very, very intentional about it.
-Well, you know, to your point about, you know,
when you started talking about the pharmacy
in a community of color,
but it's people not from the neighborhood
who are getting the appointments,
Laura Jarett at CNN last week did a story
about that very thing happening at a local pharmacy.
I believe it was in Queens.
And so that is emblematic of what you're talking about.
You were saying before, many people have questions
and so I've got questions from folks in the audience.
I'm going to go through each of them, one after the other.
The first one is from Kevin Donnelly in Illinois.
He asks, "What is the administration's plan broadly
around onshoring of the U.S. health-care supply
and specifically about the current PPE disconnect?"
-This is a great question and a big priority.
So, take something like the febrile gloves
that, you know, anybody who is administering a vaccine
or in a hospital needs to wear.
Only about 5% of them have been made onshore.
95% of them come from Asian countries.
And anybody in a hospital can tell you
we're in a deep shortage of those, as an example.
So we used the Defense Production Act,
which is an act that allows us to direct manufacturing
here in the U.S.,
and we are beginning to onshore those gloves immediately
and, by December, we will be producing
a billion gloves a month in the U.S.
And we are going to be doing that item by item.
We are doing this with other items
and it's an important win because we need the resilience
and reliability of having these items here,
available to us in the U.S.
Obviously, more manufacturing jobs is a great thing
and so we are absolutely going to turn the tide on that.
-The next question comes
from Charles Crisostomo in Maryland.
His question is, "When do you think states
will see a substantial increase in vaccine supply deliveries?"
Well, thank you for the question, Charles.
I think what we're going to see is,
every week, a continued ramp.
So we've been taking up --
When we got here January 20th,
about 8.6 million vaccines were being distributed to states.
Today, that number is 13.5 million.
On top of that, we have retail pharmacy
and federally qualified health centers,
so there's been a 60% increase already
and I think that will continue.
Again, barring weather issues,
which we're dealing with this week,
we will continue to see that, so that, by the end of March,
we will have available for distribution to states
about 200 million total vaccines.
So if you did the math on that --
and I wouldn't expect you to be able to do it instantly --
you'll see that, by the end of March,
that implies that there will be
a whole lot more than there are today.
And it's the nature of these manufacturing processes,
you've got to basically very carefully create the vaccine,
then, you have to take it to another facility --
I know I'm over-answering the question,
but this stuff is just fascinating to me,
and we got into these details --
to do what's called fill and finish,
which is basically how they put it in the little vials.
Make sure you get the needles, make sure it's all sterile,
and ship it, put it in boxes,
all at cold temperatures, et cetera.
So it's an extraordinary manufacturing process.
I think it was one that the president is going to go see
later this week, hopefully, in Kalamazoo,
and, you know, it requires a whole lot of scale.
I think we all probably were led to believe
that there was a lot more manufacturing
that had been done over the last year,
in anticipation of the vaccines being approved.
There was less than we all thought.
But, you know, one thing about leading and management --
the name of this event -- that I would say is
you play the cards you were dealt,
not the cards you wish you had.
And so, you know, we would love to say
that we could triple vaccinations next week,
but better for us to be very candid with the public
and say it is going to be week over week over week,
to the point where, you know, come spring and summer,
I think we will have significantly turned the tide.
-The next question is another question
from Illinois, Carol Nunns.
Her question is, "How will vaccines be updated
for variants, for instance?
If you receive the JJ vaccine" --
the Johnson & Johnson vaccine --
"can you still get a Moderna or Pfizer eventually?"
-So, thanks for the question. That's another great question
and there's a couple parts to it.
First is, are we making sure
the vaccines work for the variants?
And the answer is yes.
We are testing right now in vitro
and I think the good news, to start with,
is that the most prominent vaccine --
the most prominent strain that's come here, the B117,
the vaccines work well for, the Pfizer and the Moderna.
The South African, which is close to the Brazilian --
if people have heard about the Brazilian
and following all this geography...
-[ Laughs ]
-...the vaccines are less effective,
but, importantly, above a threshold
and the threshold is, "Does it work or does it not?"
So it does work. it creates fewer antibodies,
but this is mostly good news
because they still continue to work.
Now, each of the vaccine companies --
and I've talked to all of them,
both the ones approved and the candidates --
have plans to continue to update their vaccines
and, if need be, create boosters down the road,
if there continue to be additional mutants,
as there likely will be.
So this is a matter of science adapting its processes
and keeping up and keeping track.
Now, to your final, very specific question.
If you have the Johnson & Johnson vaccine,
could you later have another vaccine?
And I will give you two parts to that answer quickly.
One is Johnson & Johnson, people may know,
is currently evaluating
how their vaccine performs with two doses --
in other words, with their own booster.
So, pending the results of that, pending what the FDA has to say,
if the vaccine's approved, in the first place,
there may be a second shot of Johnson & Johnson.
More broadly, can you mix and match?
If you have one, can you later take another?
And the answer is try to remember which one you had,
because that's what's been tested.
It's preferable to have the same one you had before.
But if you forgot, don't panic.
You can take another one
and the CDC says that that's fine, in that case.
Sorry for the long answer.
-Look, more information is better than less or none,
so thank you very much for that, Mr. Slavitt.
I want to ask you about testing.
It's been reported that the Biden administration
is finalizing contracts with six companies
to provide more than 60 million at-home coronavirus tests
by the end of summer.
When will this be finalized and how much will it cost?
-So I'm going to clarify that these are
at-home or point-of-care tests.
-Okay. -So [indistinct] tests,
some some at home, some you take at a point-of-care.
The cost of the tests will vary.
And, you know, I think it's a critical question
because, the more manufacturing scale there is,
the more those costs will come down,
but if people are going to take tests on a regular basis,
the goal -- and we're not there yet,
but the goal is to have tests that are available
for $10 or less.
That's not where we are today.
Today, some of these tests are $30, some are more.
And there are some people who are making tests
that they could sell for $30,
that they're selling for a lot more than that.
And that's just not going to work because, remember,
it's not about testing.
It's about the uses of the testing.
It's about getting back to school.
It's about getting back to work.
It's about attending events at weddings
and family gatherings.
So, if you have to spend $150 or $120
every time you want to go out of the house,
that just doesn't work,
so we need lower and lower and lower-cost testing.
That's why we're investing so much in these tests,
so that they scale, that they have
a lot of the production capacity
and that they will bring their costs down.
-There's also been a lot of questions
about the accuracy around those tests.
Are these new, at-home tests, or, as you also say,
they're at-home and point-of-care tests,
are they more accurate now?
-Yeah, they are. The antigen tests
that you're referring to are accurate.
They're the ones that are all through EUA.
But one of the things that I think is interesting is,
you know, just play this mind exercise.
If you had a test that was, you know,
80% accurate, but was so inexpensive,
you could take it five times a week;
or one that was 90% accurate, but was so expensive,
you could only take it once a week,
which would you rather have?
So, in other words, would you trade off --
would we trade off, for some tests,
a little bit of accuracy,
in exchange for the ability to take it more frequently?
And, of course, the math would say
that you would be willing, for certain tests,
where you're not symptomatic,
you just want to know whether you can go out of the house,
you would trade off a little bit of the accuracy.
So we tend to get caught up in these numbers --
95%, 90%, et cetera.
And I understand why that is, of course --
because we want to know for certain --
but what we're really doing is we're reducing a risk.
And, if you take a test five times in a row
and it's 80% accurate,
you've got a pretty good sense of how you're doing.
So I don't want to say that these are not accurate enough.
They are sensitive, but I also say
we have to change our mind-set, to say,
"Let's make sure that we are getting
lower-cost tests into the system."
-So, then, how long does it take to get those test results,
for the at-home test?
-Those are instant.
15 minutes, I think.
-15 minutes?
-Yeah. -Oh, that's good.
You know, Mr. Slavitt,
in The Washington Post, in the actual paper today,
on page 4, is a key nugget in the story,
and it's about happening in the Biden administration,
in terms of when we're going to get through this
and when kids are going to get to school.
And here's the key nugget.
"The Biden administration is struggling to give precise,
consistent answers to two key questions:
When will the pandemic truly be behind us?
And, short of that,
when can children safely return to school?"
Mr. Slavitt, could you give us a precise answer
to those two questions?
-So the problem, of course, is there is no precise answer.
And we struggle because we hear people.
They want to know something certainly.
And I don't mean this in a political way,
but I think we've lived for a year
with a lot of overpromises,
a lot of, "The solution's around the corner.
This is going away," et cetera, et cetera.
And I think we're very sensitive
and very reluctant to try to overpromise.
One of the reasons why I think the public is so fatigued
is because no one was ever asked to prepare for a marathon.
People were told, "This is a sprint
and it's going to be over soon,"
and so I think the president,
who, in a town hall this week,
said, look, he's very hopeful, by Christmas.
That's a reasonable answer.
But the rest of us --
the rest of us are hired to get the job done,
not make forecasts and make predictions.
So there's a lot we don't know about the future.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen
with the variants. We don't know exactly
how many people are going to take the vaccine.
We don't know a lot of things.
And so we are trying not to give a false sense of security
and a false sense of precision where none exists.
And I know that makes people less comfortable,
but I also know people want to be leveled with
and they want to be told the truth.
And sometimes the truth is a little more complex
and it can't be done in a sound bite.
And so I think we're doing our best
to be as honest as possible
and what you're hearing is that there are no solid answers.
There is no precise, exact date.
But what you should be comfortable in is
that the team is using every available resource
of the federal government and the country
to get it done as quickly as possible.
-You know, in a previous answer, you said something that
piqued my interest.
You were saying you deal with the cards you're dealt,
not the cards you wished you had, or something like that.
And it made me wonder, were you --
"you," meaning the Biden administration --
were you given any cards?
Because I remember, during the transition,
there were plenty of stories
about how the Biden transition team,
particularly the COVID team, had no visibility into what
the Trump administration was doing in that time
between Election Day and Inauguration Day.
So bring us inside the room.
How much information were you getting
from the previous administration to prepare for the pandemic
that was going to become your responsibility on January 20th?
-I want to be careful to answer this
in a way that is direct and responsive,
but not seen as overly political
and not unnecessarily badmouthing anybody.
There were very good people
that we're working on the pandemic before we got here.
Many of them are still here.
They're career civil servants
and they've been doing a yeoman's job.
I think what we lacked was --
certainly, it's no secret we lacked
a president who was willing to be accountable
and so pushed things off to states.
And that made it harder for, I think, the rest of their team.
And so we had no plan.
We certainly had no plan that we were handed,
which was puzzling to us.
There wasn't as much inventory of vaccine as we had believed
and there weren't plans to actually go the last mile.
So there was a great effort to produce vaccines
and get the scientific machinery working,
but, once those vaccines were shipped,
that was sort of the end of the job.
I think the hard part, here, is the last mile --
getting these to communities, getting them to people,
getting them to communities that really need them.
We talked a little bit earlier about communities of color,
but there's lots of other communities also,
you know, prisons, homeless populations, et cetera.
So, you know, we declare success when the needle is
in someone's arm and they're better.
And so I don't want to get into like
were they doing their jobs or not.
There were people here who were doing very good work.
I think we came in and felt
that we had to put together a plan,
level with the public.
We have the blessing of having a very supportive president
and vice president, a very inquisitive president
and vice president, who want to know all these details.
That makes it easier for us
because we know the president cares
and he's brought in, I think, some amazing people.
I'm not not talking about myself,
but the other people that are working on this
are some of the best in the world.
So it's a good feeling to go every day
and know you're facing a big challenge
and, you know, and we are where we are.
Again, I don't want to look backwards too much
because I also want people who,
no matter what their political leanings,
to not feel like this vaccine process
and the public health process is something that
is a matter of their own political identity.
It's a matter of their family's health
and the community's health.
-And I hear you on that
and understand why you're being very careful
about not wading into the politics of it all,
so in this last question --
because I know you have a hard out at 10:00 --
given that there are career people
who have been working on this and who are there,
since the Biden administration has been in,
have you noticed a resurgence, if you will,
in terms of activity and process and ideas and energy coming
from all the entities involved in making sure
that we do get through to the other side of this pandemic?
-We have. I mean, we heard a comment from FEMA that said,
"We are getting to do our jobs.
I mean, we are now like the sky's the limit,"
and it feels good to them.
The scientists, who we honor --
and, look, many of us were --
I was in the Obama administration, others were --
you know, we have an incredible appreciation
for not just the scientists,
but all the career civil servants
that have been working on this and I think
have just been really excited to get back to work with them.
And the first thing we did is we said,
"What ideas have you been working on
that you haven't been able to get done?
For any reason, not necessarily a nefarious reason,
just there may not have been the time or the focus
or no one asked you the question."
And the first handful of things we did
were ideas that a career civil servant said, "Hey,
if we were really smart, we would do this,"
and just enabling them and said, "Go do that.
Go do that. Go open up this vaccination clinic site.
Absolutely. You want to go create
an adaptive process for more therapy?
Just go do that."
And we, at the White House, taking the approach to say,
"Do your jobs.
Tell us what you need.
We will build a strategy around you,"
as opposed to, "We will tell you what to do."
I hope it's refreshing to people.
But, you know, we have to prove ourselves.
I think the political class needs
to come in and prove themselves to the career civil servants
as much as anything else,
because these are the people that are here day in, day out.
They're going to be here day in, day out for decades
and you've got to honor their work.
-As you mentioned, in the Obama administration,
you were the acting administrator
of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
In the Biden administration.
you are the White House senior advisor
to the COVID-19 Response Team.
Andy Slavitt, thank you very, very much

Full text: Immunizing teenagers is a critical part of slowing the pandemic and reaching herd immunity. But enrolling them in clinical trials poses challenges that are very different than wrangling adults.
To get out of ninth-grade science period one recent Friday, the King twins had an excuse that is so very 2021.
Alexandra and Isabelle, 14, had to miss class -- including a test -- because they were participating in an actual science experiment: a clinical trial of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine to evaluate whether the shot is effective and safe in children ages 12 through 17.
"In science we're learning about, like, genetics and stuff like that," said Alexandra during the monitoring period after they'd gotten their shots at a Houston clinic. "So maybe the teacher will say, 'Oh, you really shouldn't have to take the test, because you're contributing to science already."'
Teenagers contract the novel coronavirus almost twice as often as younger children but vaccines authorized in the United States are mostly for adults -- Moderna's for 18 and older, Pfizer's for 16 and up. While teenagers don't become severely ill from the virus as often as adults, research suggests that because they are often asymptomatic and casual about social distancing, they can be efficient spreaders -- to one another as well as to adults like parents, grandparents and teachers. Although vaccinating educators will be an important factor in keeping schools open, vaccinating students will also be a key element.
Bottom line: If widespread immunity to the coronavirus is to be achieved, adolescents are critical links. They need a Covid vaccine that works for them.
But teenagers are harder than adults to enroll and keep in clinical trials. They are difficult to wrangle and not so great with compliance, which includes keeping a symptom diary and keeping appointments, as many as six a year, that include blood draws (for some, an instant deal breaker).
To reach students, some researchers have tapped school connections, local pediatricians and social media campaigns. While waiting for appointments in the vaccine research clinics, some teenagers, ignoring advice to keep their vaccine volunteering off of social media, have posted TikTok videos, which have inspired friends to sign up. But the adolescent Covid vaccine trials will be much smaller than the adult trials -- two or three thousand subjects instead of 30,000.
"You want to enroll as many kids as necessary but as few as possible, to expose as few as possible," said Dr. Robert W. Frenck, director of the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.
To enroll in a trial, children must give "assent," a legally required, age-appropriate version of "consent." But researchers must also obtain the parent's consent or permission. Information sessions for each can be protracted and painstaking. Objection by either child or parent terminates the application.
"Parents may be willing to put themselves in a study but not their children," said Dr. James Campbell, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who conducts vaccine trials. "Their key role in life, as parents, is to keep their children safe and they may choose to wait until a vaccine is licensed rather than enroll their child in a trial."
Often researchers give young subjects an additional caution. Because vaccine disinformation and online personal attacks are so widespread, youth volunteers should avoid discussing their role in the trial on social media.
Although the novel coronavirus has had far less impact on children than older adults, some 2.2 million pediatric cases in the United States have been reported and about 280 children have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 2,060 children have contracted a dangerous rare condition related to the coronavirus called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which can shut down the heart and other organs.
And like an enemy occupation, the pandemic has taken over most children's lives -- shutting down in-person school, sports, socializing. That has prompted some teenagers, who otherwise feel so powerless, to fight back by volunteering for vaccine trials.
Sam, 12, who entered the Pfizer trial at Cincinnati Children's hospital, said he wanted to participate "because it would be helping science and beat the pandemic. And it was my way of saying thank you to the frontline workers who are keeping us healthy."
His sister, Audrey, 14, who is also in the study, said, "I thought this would be a really good story I could tell my children and grandchildren -- that I tried to help create the vaccine."
"And I also thought it is important to have people of different ages and races represented," added Audrey, who, like her brother, is Asian. (Their mother, Rachel, a nurse researcher who volunteered for a vaccine trial, asked that their last names be withheld for privacy reasons.)
Overall, the teen trials may be less diverse, because results from adult trials showed no discernible difference in outcome by race. And because the adult trials were so successful, up to two-thirds of teenagers may be offered the actual vaccine rather than a placebo.
Pfizer, whose trial is fully enrolled, expects results from its trials for children ages 12 through 15 in the first quarter of this year, which it will then submit to the Food and Drug Administration for review. Moderna is still recruiting for its adolescent trials, with data anticipated sometime this summer. Other companies expect to start adolescent trials soon. Shortly after, researchers will open trials for children as young as 5, most likely with more modest doses.
As in any medical trial, investigators are evenhanded when discussing risks and benefits. Rather than lecturing young subjects, Dr. Campbell, whose clinic will conduct a Moderna trial for younger children, engages them in conversation.
"Do you remember your tetanus shot? Tell me about it," he might say. And then, "Here's how this is similar and how it's different." He wants to make sure the teenager is actively involved in decision-making. "We always say, 'Don't do this for your parents.' "
Dr. Sarah Hasan, lead recruiter for DM Clinical Research, which oversees the Houston Fights Covid campaign and most of the city's vaccine trials, said that information sessions for adolescents and adults differ strikingly. She has more fun with the teenagers.
"Usually adults will skim the form, ask a few questions and they're done," she said. "But kids ask way more questions than adults and they're actually listening, which is pretty nice."
"Of course," she added, "they also want to know if the doses will turn them into zombies."
During adult trials, when participants were leery and results unknown, no-shows for appointments were common, Dr. Hasan said. But teenagers "come on time and are being super-compliant."
Another issue in enrollment is compensation. Researchers typically offer volunteers money to cover time and travel expenses but the amount cannot be substantial enough to seem like an inducement. The going rate is about $ 15 an hour. The Cincinnati Pfizer trial compensates parents too, reasoning that they contribute time and money, as unofficial chauffeurs for the young subjects.
In Houston, the King sisters were already fantasizing about how they would spend the money.
Alexandra's impulses were immediately generous. Now she could buy presents for others that her father typically paid for. "It'll definitely be something nice to do, like, I earned it by getting a shot in the arm to help people. And now at least I can buy Christmas gifts for my mom," she said.
Her sister Isabelle hastily chimed in that, of course, she too would use the money for something selfless. Then she did allow, "Well, my closet could use an update."
This summer, Monica Mitchell, a community health educator who works for Cincinnati Children's, participated in a Pfizer vaccine trial. Her daughter Melanie, a high school junior, was deeply curious, but at that point, volunteers had to be at least 16 years old. On the day she turned 16, Melanie called to enroll.
Both mother and daughter have become ambassadors for the vaccine. "Someone said to me, 'You're doing the white man's work,"' recounted Melanie, who is Black. "And I said, 'No, it's the opposite. I'm doing the work for my people.' "
Dr. Mitchell, who is also a pediatric psychologist and researcher, got some blowback for allowing her daughter to enter a vaccine trial. "Some relatives asked, "'Why would you do that?' But at least they understand that Melanie is fairly independent and they know she made her own decision," Dr. Mitchell said.
Like most trial volunteers, children worry about side effects. Sure enough, after Sam got the second dose from Cincinnati Children's hospital, he had a rough go of it.
In the middle of the night he woke with a throbbing headache. Then chills, a low-grade fever, muscle aches.
"He looked miserable," said his mother, Rachel. "It's one thing to talk theoretically about side effects but it was hard as a mom to see him feeling really bad."
She felt guilty for having encouraged him to participate. "I'm so sorry," she said.
Sam was mystified by her reaction. "I'm so happy," he replied. "This means I got the real thing!"
Audrey, his sister, felt fine after her dose. "I'm jealous," she said.

Mitchell, who is also a pediatric psychologist and researcher, got some blowback for allowing her daughter to enter a vaccine trial. “Some relatives asked, “‘Why would you do that?’ But at least they understand that Melanie is fairly independent and they know she made her own decision,” Mitchell said.
Like most trial volunteers, children worry about side effects. Sure enough, after Sam got the second dose from Cincinnati Children’s hospital, he had a rough go of it.
In the middle of the night he woke with a throbbing headache. Then chills, a low-grade fever, muscle aches.
“He looked miserable,” said his mother, Rachel. “It’s one thing to talk theoretically about side effects but it was hard as a mom to see him feeling really bad.”
She felt guilty for having encouraged him to participate. “I’m so sorry,” she said.
Sam was mystified by her reaction. “I’m so happy,” he replied. “This means I got the real thing!”
Audrey, his sister, felt fine after her dose. “I’m jealous,” she said.

Full text: Immunizing teenagers is a critical part of slowing the pandemic and reaching herd immunity. But enrolling them in clinical trials poses challenges that are very different than wrangling adults.
To get out of ninth-grade science period one recent Friday, the King twins had an excuse that is so very 2021.
Alexandra and Isabelle, 14, had to miss class — including a test — because they were participating in an actual science experiment: a clinical trial of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine to evaluate whether the shot is effective and safe in children ages 12 through 17.
“In science we’re learning about, like, genetics and stuff like that,” said Alexandra during the monitoring period after they’d gotten their shots at a Houston clinic. “So maybe the teacher will say, ‘Oh, you really shouldn’t have to take the test, because you’re contributing to science already.’”
Teenagers contract the novel coronavirus almost twice as often as younger children but vaccines authorized in the United States are mostly for adults — Moderna’s for 18 and older, Pfizer’s for 16 and up. While teenagers don’t become severely ill from the virus as often as adults, research suggests that because they are often asymptomatic and casual about social distancing, they can be efficient spreaders — to one another as well as to adults like parents, grandparents and teachers. Although vaccinating educators will be an important factor in keeping schools open, vaccinating students will also be a key element.
Bottom line: If widespread immunity to the coronavirus is to be achieved, adolescents are critical links. They need a Covid vaccine that works for them.
But teenagers are harder than adults to enroll and keep in clinical trials. They are difficult to wrangle and not so great with compliance, which includes keeping a symptom diary and keeping appointments, as many as six a year, that include blood draws (for some, an instant deal breaker).
To reach students, some researchers have tapped school connections, local pediatricians and social media campaigns. While waiting for appointments in the vaccine research clinics, some teenagers, ignoring advice to keep their vaccine volunteering off of social media, have posted TikTok videos, which have inspired friends to sign up. But the adolescent Covid vaccine trials will be much smaller than the adult trials — two or three thousand subjects instead of 30,000.
“You want to enroll as many kids as necessary but as few as possible, to expose as few as possible,” said Dr. Robert W. Frenck, director of the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.
To enroll in a trial, children must give “assent,” a legally required, age-appropriate version of “consent.” But researchers must also obtain the parent’s consent or permission. Information sessions for each can be protracted and painstaking. Objection by either child or parent terminates the application.
“Parents may be willing to put themselves in a study but not their children,” said Dr. James Campbell, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who conducts vaccine trials. “Their key role in life, as parents, is to keep their children safe and they may choose to wait until a vaccine is licensed rather than enroll their child in a trial.”
Often researchers give young subjects an additional caution. Because vaccine disinformation and online personal attacks are so widespread, youth volunteers should avoid discussing their role in the trial on social media.
Although the novel coronavirus has had far less impact on children than older adults, some 2.2 million pediatric cases in the United States have been reported and about 280 children have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 2,060 children have contracted a dangerous rare condition related to the coronavirus called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which can shut down the heart and other organs.
And like an enemy occupation, the pandemic has taken over most children’s lives — shutting down in-person school, sports, socializing. That has prompted some teenagers, who otherwise feel so powerless, to fight back by volunteering for vaccine trials.
Sam, 12, who entered the Pfizer trial at Cincinnati Children’s hospital, said he wanted to participate “because it would be helping science and beat the pandemic. And it was my way of saying thank you to the frontline workers who are keeping us healthy.”
His sister, Audrey, 14, who is also in the study, said, “I thought this would be a really good story I could tell my children and grandchildren — that I tried to help create the vaccine.”
“And I also thought it is important to have people of different ages and races represented,” added Audrey, who, like her brother, is Asian. (Their mother, Rachel, a nurse researcher who volunteered for a vaccine trial, asked that their last names be withheld for privacy reasons.)
Overall, the teen trials may be less diverse, because results from adult trials showed no discernible difference in outcome by race. And because the adult trials were so successful, up to two-thirds of teenagers may be offered the actual vaccine rather than a placebo.
Pfizer, whose trial is fully enrolled, expects results from its trials for children ages 12 through 15 in the first quarter of this year, which it will then submit to the Food and Drug Administration for review. Moderna is still recruiting for its adolescent trials, with data anticipated sometime this summer. Other companies expect to start adolescent trials soon. Shortly after, researchers will open trials for children as young as 5, most likely with more modest doses.
As in any medical trial, investigators are evenhanded when discussing risks and benefits. Rather than lecturing young subjects, Dr. Campbell, whose clinic will conduct a Moderna trial for younger children, engages them in conversation.
“Do you remember your tetanus shot? Tell me about it,” he might say. And then, “Here’s how this is similar and how it’s different.” He wants to make sure the teenager is actively involved in decision-making. “We always say, ‘Don’t do this for your parents.’ ”
Dr. Sarah Hasan, lead recruiter for DM Clinical Research, which oversees the Houston Fights Covid campaign and most of the city’s vaccine trials, said that information sessions for adolescents and adults differ strikingly. She has more fun with the teenagers.
“Usually adults will skim the form, ask a few questions and they’re done,” she said. “But kids ask way more questions than adults and they’re actually listening, which is pretty nice.”
“Of course,” she added, “they also want to know if the doses will turn them into zombies.”
During adult trials, when participants were leery and results unknown, no-shows for appointments were common, Dr. Hasan said. But teenagers “come on time and are being super-compliant.”
Another issue in enrollment is compensation. Researchers typically offer volunteers money to cover time and travel expenses but the amount cannot be substantial enough to seem like an inducement. The going rate is about $15 an hour. The Cincinnati Pfizer trial compensates parents too, reasoning that they contribute time and money, as unofficial chauffeurs for the young subjects.
In Houston, the King sisters were already fantasizing about how they would spend the money.
Alexandra’s impulses were immediately generous. Now she could buy presents for others that her father typically paid for. “It’ll definitely be something nice to do, like, I earned it by getting a shot in the arm to help people. And now at least I can buy Christmas gifts for my mom,” she said.
Her sister Isabelle hastily chimed in that, of course, she too would use the money for something selfless. Then she did allow, “Well, my closet could use an update.”
This summer, Monica Mitchell, a community health educator who works for Cincinnati Children’s, participated in a Pfizer vaccine trial. Her daughter Melanie, a high school junior, was deeply curious, but at that point, volunteers had to be at least 16 years old. On the day she turned 16, Melanie called to enroll.
Both mother and daughter have become ambassadors for the vaccine. “Someone said to me, ‘You’re doing the white man’s work,’” recounted Melanie, who is Black. “And I said, ‘No, it’s the opposite. I’m doing the work for my people.’ ”
Dr. Mitchell, who is also a pediatric psychologist and researcher, got some blowback for allowing her daughter to enter a vaccine trial. “Some relatives asked, “‘Why would you do that?’ But at least they understand that Melanie is fairly independent and they know she made her own decision,” Dr. Mitchell said.
Like most trial volunteers, children worry about side effects. Sure enough, after Sam got the second dose from Cincinnati Children’s hospital, he had a rough go of it.
In the middle of the night he woke with a throbbing headache. Then chills, a low-grade fever, muscle aches.
“He looked miserable,” said his mother, Rachel. “It’s one thing to talk theoretically about side effects but it was hard as a mom to see him feeling really bad.”
She felt guilty for having encouraged him to participate. “I’m so sorry,” she said.
Sam was mystified by her reaction. “I’m so happy,” he replied. “This means I got the real thing!”
Audrey, his sister, felt fine after her dose. “I’m jealous,” she said.

Full text: Iran announced on Tuesday that its first batch of Covid-19 vaccine, Russia’s Sputnik V, would arrive on Thursday. It coincided with a study published Tuesday in a British medical journal that the vaccine was safe and effective.
The news could not come at a better time for Iran. Vaccines, like everything else in the Islamic Republic, have been politicized and subject to disinformation from the top down.
Iran’s supreme leader has declared a ban on importing American- and British-made vaccines, saying they could not be trusted. The Iranian health ministry canceled a batch of donated Pfizer doses and said it would import vaccines from Russia and China and co-develop a vaccine with Cuba.
For weeks, senior Iranian health officials have publicly argued over whether it was safe to inoculate Iranians with the Russian vaccine because it had not been approved by the World Health Organization or any Western medical agency.
Before the Lancet study said that Sputnik V had a 91.6 percent efficacy rate against the coronavirus, several high-profile Iranians had expressed skepticism about it, including Iran’s top infectious disease official and the head of Parliament’s health committee. And 98 physicians from Iran’s largest union of medical workers wrote a letter last week to President Hassan Rouhani urging him not to purchase the “unapproved and unsafe” Sputnik vaccine.
Other health officials pushed back defending the Russian vaccine, including the health minister and his former spokesman.
On Twitter, a hashtag trending in Persian was #buysafevaccines, as many Iranians declared they would reject Russian- and Chinese-made vaccines.
In other news from around the world:

- Chile announced that it has started an ambitious mass vaccination program, with the goal of inoculating five million people by the end of March. For now, it is prioritizing high-risk groups like health care workers, child care home workers, those who work in senior living facilities and older adults. The country said it had received about four million doses of China’s Sinovac vaccine and expects to receive more than 10 million.

- New Zealand ’s drug regulator said on Wednesday that it had provisionally approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine but added 58 conditions, most of which require the manufacturer to supply extra data. Pfizer said last week that the first of the 1.5 million vaccines on order were expected to arrive before the end of February. New Zealand’s director-general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, has said that the country will be “ready to start vaccinating people as soon as a vaccine arrives.

- The state of Victoria , Australia, declared the coronavirus “technically eliminated” on Wednesday — for the second time — after a month in which no new cases were recorded. The state government also announced a rollout plan for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that is scheduled to begin in late February. Frontline health workers will be among those included in the first phase, and nine vaccination hubs will be established at the state’s major hospitals. “This is a significant day in the response of the Victorian community to the pandemic,” said Martin Foley, the state’s health minister. “It turns a corner.”

- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said on Tuesday that his government had signed a tentative deal with Novavax to produce the company’s coronavirus vaccine at a government facility in Montreal, once the drug and the site are approved by domestic regulators. Canada has a separate agreement to purchase 52 million doses of the Maryland-based company’s drug, but its regulators have so far only approved the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Novavax is expected to deliver results from its Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States in March, and to deliver 100 million doses for use there later this year.

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
The Daily 202 debuted on June 10, 2015. Six days later, Donald Trump rode down a golden escalator to launch his presidential campaign and remake American politics. Since then, Trump's name has appeared in every single edition of this newsletter.
That was not our original plan. To coincide with our launch, I interviewed a dozen candidates for the Republican nomination. When one of Trump's top advisers called to say he wanted to participate, I respectfully declined, explaining that I was only showcasing people who had a realistic shot of winning the White House. The next day, I ran my Q&A with former Texas governor Rick Perry. Oops.
The rest is history, and we have lived it together. A reality television star became the first U.S. president with no prior governing or military experience. Thanks to readers like you, the Daily 202 succeeded beyond our wildest dreams.
It feels fitting for my final Big Idea to run on this last full day of Trump's presidency. As Joe Biden becomes the 46th president on Wednesday, Olivier Knox will take the reins of this newsletter. After a few weeks of contemplative time, I will begin writing a column on the Opinion page.
Narrating the Trump era has been an eye-opening, if exhausting, labor of love. I woke up at 2 a.m. more than 1,400 times to ensure this email would be as fresh and comprehensive as possible. I've recorded about 900 editions of the accompanying Big Idea podcast, which launched in July 2017. Because there is no substitute for shoe-leather reporting, I filed this newsletter from 41 states. If not for the pandemic, I might have reached 50 by now.
From climate change to Charlottesville to the coronavirus, news cycles have only seemed to accelerate these past 5 1/2 years. I tried to make sense of two impeachments, three election cycles and four Supreme Court confirmation battles. There was #MeToo, the racial reckoning and that always-looming bear in the woods.
Trump has shown a singular ability to put himself at the center of all of these stories. Whether you loved him or hated him, many of you seemed to always be thinking about him. There was constant chaos and record staff turnover, with feuds and firings. The experience opened our eyes to the fragility of certain institutions, including the Justice Department, and the strengths of others, including the press.
Even after his repudiation in November, the lame-duck Trump continued to suck up most of the political oxygen by denying his defeat, trying to overturn election results and inciting a mob of his supporters to attack the Capitol. Even after leaving office, Trump will continue to be a top story because of his impending Senate trial. There will likely be controversy over the pardons he is expected to issue during his final hours. Trumpism will remain a dominant force in Republican politics. More books will probably come out about Trump than Biden next year, as publishing houses place big bets that the national addiction to Trump will endure.
If history is any guide, though, attention will eventually fade. The country will probably move on sooner than many people suspect. Twitter banning the outgoing president has had a dramatic impact that might be a harbinger of what's to come. Research firm Zignal Labs found that online misinformation about election fraud dropped 73 percent in the week after several social media sites suspended Trump and his allies.
Newspapers will no longer have a journalistic duty to cover every pronouncement from a former president. Neither will cable television, especially if Trump does not generate the ratings he once did. Biden will face major challenges in cleaning up the many messes and crises that he's about to inherit, and he will surely create some of his own. I do not yet know what it will say, but I have resolved that my first column will not be about Trump.
So many people deserve special thanks.
PowerPost editor Rachel Van Dongen, who recruited me from Politico, has been a wonderful boss and friend since the beginning. Her deputy, Sara Sorcher, has been instrumental in keeping the trains running on time. The 202's success would never have been possible without the vision of publisher Fred Ryan, as well as the support of executive editor Marty Baron, managing editor Cameron Barr, national editor Steven Ginsberg and national politics editor Peter Wallsten.
Mariana Alfaro has heroically worked the overnight shift as the Daily 202's lead researcher since 2019, parsing and aggregating literally hundreds of stories a day. Before Mariana, I was fortunate to work with Joanie Greve, Breanne Deppisch and Elise Viebeck in this role.
The Big Idea podcast would not have been possible without producer Ariel Plotnik, and Anne Li before her, as well as audio editors Jess Stahl and Allison Michaels.
Thank you to the copy editors on the early shift who have saved me from countless typos, including Thomas Heleba, Melissa Ngo and Sue Doyle.
Finally, and most of all, I want to thank all the readers and listeners. With limited time and busy lives, you have welcomed me into your homes and let me tag along during your commutes. I have always enjoyed your kind words of encouragement. Who wouldn't? But I want to sign off by letting you know how much I have also sincerely appreciated your critiques and quibbles. I always took your thoughtful, sometimes challenging, feedback to heart. Your messages made me smarter and better at my job.
Tune in for our special inauguration coverage.
I will join Libby Casey tonight at 5 p.m. Eastern to cover Biden's arrival in Washington and a vigil he will attend for coronavirus victims. We will be live again at 8 a.m. tomorrow from The Post's newsroom for wall-to-wall coverage of the inaugural festivities. You can watch here.
Trump's final daysScholars will struggle to understand what the Trump era says about American democracy.
"More than 30,000 falsehoods and lies. Nearly 400,000 coronavirus deaths. Rising white nationalism. Financial self-dealing. A social media ban. Two impeachments. A deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump's four years in office come to a close Wednesday after a reign defined by constant chaos, corruption and scandal, a tenure that numerous scholars predict is destined to rank him among America's worst presidents," David Nakamura reports. "The historians preparing to reckon with his legacy say it's not just Trump who will be examined in the harsh reflection of history's mirror, but also American society and the nation's commitment to democracy. Trump's relentless attacks on civic institutions, provoking of racial and social divisions, trampling of political norms, broadsides against the free press and impugning of America's international allies have raised profound questions about the nature of American governance and the endurance of the values the United States has long professed to cherish, scholars said. 'Trump and Trumpism have brought those flaws into sharp relief,' said Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University."
"The social conditions that brought so many people to believe the falsehoods Trump has told about the election and a litany of other issues took root decades before he became a political figure and will extend far beyond the four years of his administration, according to scholars of disinformation and conspiratorial thinking," Jose Del Real reports.
Trump's final job approval rating is the worst of his presidency at 34 percent, according to Gallup, one point worse than in the aftermath of Charlottesville. "His 41% average approval rating throughout his presidency is four points lower than for any of his predecessors," Gallup notes.
Just over 1 in 10 Americans say the pandemic is mostly under control, despite Trump's parting insistence that case numbers are being exaggerated, according to fresh Post-ABC News polling. The survey found that large majorities of people of all political affiliations say they think the deadly virus is only somewhat, or not at all, under control. (Amy Goldstein and Emily Guskin)
Trump taped a farewell address on Monday, and the recording will likely be released today. (CNN)
"You never want to be ranked below William Henry Harrison, who was only president for one month. If you rank below him, it means you've harmed the country," said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University. "Now you're getting into James Buchanan and Andrew Johnson territory. Trump will automatically be in that category."
Trump issued an executive order to mandate the creation of a "Garden of American Heroes" including statues of Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Martin Luther King Jr., Harper Lee, Steve Jobs, Whitney Houston and Kobe Bryant.
While the president remains mired in grievance, his wife plots their next chapter.
"In her final days as first lady, Melania Trump has largely stayed away from the West Wing. While her husband spends his time there in anger — though aides said his dark mood has lightened since he began planning a rousing military send-off for himself — she has shown no sign of any disappointment for how the president's era is ending," Mary Jordan reports. "Instead, she has been busying herself with finding a new school for Barron in Florida and working on her own farewell video message to the country, which she released Monday. Several people who have been in touch with Melania Trump said she is aware of the intense criticism both she and her husband have gotten since the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot, but that unlike her spouse she appears completely unfazed. … She focuses on what she has control over: choreographing her own exit, trying to cement her legacy as a first lady who devoted much time to renovations of the White House, and making plans to continue her 'Be Best' initiative. …
"One person close to the president said it can be hard to predict what will bother him most and that even with all that was going on, he was particularly upset that Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Tom Hanks and other stars agreed to perform as part of Biden's inaugural celebrations. … [The first lady] is expected to be involved in the site selection, planning and design of the Trump presidential library, which probably will be located in Florida. Her stepdaughter Ivanka Trump also has expressed interest in the library."
Snubbed by the Trumps, the Bidens will be greeted at the White House by chief usher Timothy Harleth.
"Harleth, a 2017 Trump hire from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, will likely not stay on in the Biden administration," CNN reports."The afternoon of Inauguration Day, [Biden] will participate in a ceremonial wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery, joined by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. … By that time, all Trump paraphernalia will be gone, and a thorough top-to-bottom cleaning of the entire White House campus will have been completed. … A particular focus of this move will be paid to the bedrooms in the residence, where new mattresses and box springs for the incoming first family are standard operating procedure … Yet one part of the bedroom set-up will be markedly different with the Bidens than it was for the Trumps: the Bidens will be sharing a bedroom. … On Monday, moving trucks were spotted in the driveways of Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, with movers loading dollies of boxes and items and rolling them into the private club."
Mike Pompeo is clinging to Trump’s legacy, hoping to inherit the MAGA base in 2024.
"The president's most loyal Cabinet member has spent the past several days heaping praise on Trump and his presidency, saying it has made the United States 'so much safer today than four years ago' and has served as a role model to other nations," John Hudson reports. "To independent observers, the remarks are wildly tone-deaf and reinforce Pompeo's status as one of the most partisan secretaries of state in modern U.S. history. … To Republican political observers, Pompeo's unflinching promotion of a twice-impeached president is part of a careful balancing act designed to lay future claim to Trump's large and loyal political base while retaining credibility among the GOP establishment. … Pompeo, who has made no secret of his presidential ambitions, is scrambling to build up his social media presence during his final week in office, repeatedly urging the more than 3 million followers of the official State Department account to follow his personal Twitter account."

Biden prepares to take overSenate committees will hold hearings today for Biden’s national security team.
"But the last-minute rush means that most, if not all, will not be confirmed by the end of Inauguration Day," Karoun Demirjian reports."The crammed schedule for the nominees — Avril Haines for director of national intelligence, Alejandro Mayorkas for homeland security secretary, Antony Blinken for secretary of state, Janet L. Yellen for treasury secretary and Lloyd J. Austin III for defense secretary — is a result of compound delays caused by factors including the Georgia Senate runoffs, paperwork disputes and partisan gridlock. Fallout from the Capitol riot this month further stymied the process, and President Trump's impending impeachment trial could slow it even more. Even if the Senate manages to squeeze in some confirmations on Biden's first full day in office, the road ahead is unclear for Austin and Mayorkas. Austin, a retired general whose military service ended in 2016, requires a waiver before he can take over as the Pentagon's top civilian. Mayorkas, meanwhile, faces Republican grievances that as deputy homeland security secretary during the Obama administration, he was accused of using an immigrant visa program to secure investments for political allies' pet projects — a charge Mayorkas has denied."
"Mayorkas, 61, is a former federal prosecutor, not a liberal activist," Maria Sacchetti and Nick Miroff write in a profile. "He would be the first Latino, and first immigrant, in charge of DHS … Born in Cuba to Jewish parents and a mother who escaped the Holocaust, Mayorkas was raised in Southern California, painfully aware of the losses undergirding his family's American success story. Through his Romanian-born mother, whose relatives were murdered by the Nazis, Mayorkas discovered the horrors that can unfold when refugees cannot flee to safety, friends and former colleagues say. Through his Cuban-born father, he learned someone can love a country and still feel compelled to leave it forever."
Yellen urged lawmakers to "act big" on economic stimulus relief during her opening statement. "I think there is a consensus now: Without further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now – and long-term scarring of the economy later," she will tell the Senate Finance Committee.

Biden will nominate Pennsylvania's top health official, Rachel Levine, to be his assistant secretary of health. The pediatrician would become the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the Senate. Biden's transition team noted that Levine — first appointed by Gov. Tom Wolf (D) in 2017 — was confirmed three times by the Republican-controlled Pennsylvania state Senate to serve as secretary of health and the state's physician general. (John Wagner and Teo Armus)
Biden will propose a sweeping overhaul of immigration laws on his first day in office.
His plan will include an eight-year pathway to citizenship for immigrants without legal status and an expansion of refugee admissions, along with an enforcement plan that deploys technology to patrol the border, Seung Min Kim reports. "Biden's legislative proposal, which will be sent to Congress on Wednesday, also includes a heavy focus on addressing the root causes of migration from Central America, a key part of Biden's foreign policy portfolio when he served as vice president. The centerpiece of the plan … is the eight-year pathway, which would put millions of qualifying immigrants in a temporary status for five years and then grant them a green card once they meet certain requirements such as a background check and payment of taxes. They would be able to apply for citizenship three years later. To qualify, immigrants must have been in the United States as of Jan. 1, a move meant to blunt any rush to the border. Beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — which granted key protections for 'dreamers' — and the temporary protected status program for migrants from disaster-ravaged nations could apply for a green card immediately."
Biden will impose ethics rules that go beyond what was put in place under Trump.
"Biden will ban his senior presidential appointees from accepting special bonuses akin to 'golden parachutes' from former employers for joining the government," Michael Scherer reports. "For departing administration employees, the Biden rules create a prohibition on lobbying the administration for at least the length of Biden's term and add a one-year restriction on assisting lobbying efforts. That is an effort to crack down on lucrative 'shadow lobbying' jobs, in which former officials go to work at law firms to help guide lobbyists without making contact with government officials themselves. Existing law prevents senior appointees from appearing before their former agency for one year after leaving office, even in a non-lobbying capacity. Under the Biden rules, that prohibition will be extended to two years and include contact with senior White House officials. …
"For people coming to the government from the private sector, Biden will reimpose a ban on lobbyists going to work for agencies they had recently lobbied, unless they get a waiver from the White House counsel. Trump had removed that restriction when he came into office. Biden will also impose restrictions on registered foreign agents who seek jobs in the administration and will ban former officials from working as foreign agents right after they leave office. …
"The executive order on ethics will not address the issue of potential family conflicts of interest … Biden has several family members involved in businesses that have potential interests in federal policy, including his son-in-law and campaign adviser Howard Krein, who helps to run a health-care start-up, and his brother-in-law John T. Owens, who owns a Delaware-based telemedicine company that markets itself as a solution amid pandemic restrictions, with medical second-opinion operations in Europe and Asia. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, who previously worked for foreign companies and is facing a tax investigation by the Justice Department, has pledged not to work for foreign-owned companies during his father's presidency."

Biden could usher in a new era of accountability for Silicon Valley.
"The Trump administration put antitrust and regulation on the agenda, and they are likely to continue under the Biden administration.

The security situationQAnon adherents discuss posing as part of the National Guard to try infiltrating the inauguration.
"The FBI privately warned law enforcement agencies Monday that far-right extremists have discussed posing as National Guard members in Washington and others have reviewed maps of vulnerable spots in the city — signs of potential efforts to disrupt Wednesday's inauguration," Carol Leonnig and Matt Zapotosky report. "The FBI also said it had observed people downloading and sharing maps of sensitive locations in Washington and discussing how those facilities could be used to interfere in security during the inauguration. But the intelligence briefing did not identify any specific plots to attack the inaugural events that would be akin to the Jan. 6 siege. … National Guard members have been warned to watch for anyone in uniform who looks like they are out of place."
The House’s security chief didn’t immediately call the National Guard because of lawmaker wariness.
"After nearly a decade working for the House of Representatives, the chamber's top security official thought he knew how its political leadership would react if asked to station troops at the Capitol during a major rally supporting Trump. That's why House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving balked when the chief of the Capitol Police suggested activating the National Guard two days before the Jan. 6 event, he later told a friend," Rosalind Helderman, Beth Reinhard, Demirjian and Leonnig report. "'There's a reality there — the leaders of the House and the Senate don't want the military up there. They don't want to show they can't control their own turf,' said Bill Pickle, who served as the Senate sergeant-at-arms from 2003 to 2007 and spoke to The Post at Irving's request. … Irving did not consult first with his boss, [Pelosi], but thought he was reflecting her likely response, Pickle said."
The FBI is probing possible connections between extremist groups at the heart of the insurrection.
"Though no one has been charged with leading or directing the violence, investigators are working to find out whether certain individuals helped coordinate aspects of the attack, before and during the chaos, or were merely opportunistic instigators," Devlin Barrett and Spencer Hsu report. "The weekend arrests of people with alleged ties to extremist groups reflects the FBI's increasing attention to the more prepared, organized and determined groups among the larger mass of rioters. One of those newly charged was Robert Gieswein, 24, of Woodland Park, Colo. Charging documents and videos indicate he may have links to the three extremist groups that have drawn the most attention from the FBI: the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters."
Federal authorities said they have arrested Capitol rioter Riley June Williams and are investigating claims from a "former romantic partner" she stole a laptop or hard drive from Pelosi's office with the intent to sell it to Russian intelligence officers. The ex-partner told the FBI that friends of Williams played a video of her stealing the drive or computer from Pelosi's office, and that Williams "intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR," according to charging documents. (Hsu and Knowles)
Guy Reffitt of Texas allegedly threatened to kill his kids if they turned him into the FBI for joining the Capitol riot. "If you turn me in, you're a traitor and you know what happens to traitors … traitors get shot," Reffitt, 48, said to his son and daughter, according to his wife, who alerted the bureau. (Jaclyn Peiser)
The Proud Boys and other fringe groups found refuge on a Christian fundraising website.
When Henry "Enrique" Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, was detained and banned from D.C. as he drove into the city on the eve of the riot, his family members "had the idea to monetize the support of his online followers through GiveSendGo.com, a niche Christian fundraising website that bills itself as 'a place to fund hope,'" Amy Brittain and David Willman report. "Within a week, the 'Enrique Tarrio Defense Fund' had amassed more than $113,000 from 2,359 donors, according to the site. Tarrio has pleaded not guilty. 'It's not just Proud Boys that are raising money there,' Tarrio said in an interview Thursday, noting that his group's chapters nationwide have used the site to fund their cause. … A review by The Post shows that the self-described Christian website has become a refuge of sorts for outcasts and extremists … The pleas for money illustrate how even small-dollar donations could make the trip to Washington possible for some Trump supporters."
FEMA denied requests from Maryland and Virginia for an emergency declaration to cover expenses associated with responding to the Capitol riot and increasing security because of the inauguration. FEMA's decision — which both states plan to appeal — would mean they receive no federal funds for providing law enforcement backup amid the insurrection. (Fredrick Kunkle)
Covid lockdowns, protests and election strife led to record gun sales.
"More firearms were sold last year than in any previous year on record," Marc Fisher, Mark Berman, Christine Spolar, Lori Rozsa and Andrew Ba Tran report. "Gun sales typically soar in the weeks following the election of a Democratic president, as buyers scurry to purchase firearms for fear that the new chief executive will fulfill campaign promises to tighten regulations. But a Washington Post analysis of gun sales in 2020 finds no such surge in recent weeks. Rather, purchases soared in March and April as the effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus led to food shortages, empty streets and millions of lost jobs. Then firearm sales peaked in July, in the weeks after massive protests against police brutality spread throughout the nation. … The flood of gun sales — about 23 million over the course of the year — represents a 64 percent increase over 2019 sales … The 2020 numbers include purchases by more than 8 million first-time buyers …
"Cherie Dercqu, who owns a nail salon in suburban Pittsburgh, never owned a gun until last year. On Thursday, she bought her 11th firearm, a shotgun she plans to keep behind the front door of her home. Dercqu, who said she spent her first stimulus check on guns, now packs a pistol in her purse and keeps another behind the cash register at her shop. She has been going to a range every couple of weeks to practice shooting and said she and her partner intend to keep buying firearms. 'Until this passes, we are buying guns,' Dercqu, 52, said. 'We're buying ammo, and we're buying as much as we can. We're two women. We don't have a guy at home. I don't want to feel vulnerable without anything.'"
The coronavirusAfter months of trauma, vaccinated health-care workers welcome a surprising emotion: Hope.
"For weeks, the long-term care facility where Linda Green works as a nurse looked to her like a battlefield hospital, swathed in plastic drapes separating the ill from the uninfected. The coronavirus ripped through the western Maryland facility like wildfire at the end of 2020, deepening Green's fear that she, at 73, might bring the virus home to her husband, who is 84," Karin Brulliard reports. "Then she received a coronavirus shot. It felt like any other vaccination, leaving her with mild upper arm soreness but no other physical side effects. The emotional effects, however, were remarkable. Even thinking of the vaccine, Green said two weeks after receiving the Moderna shot, makes her practically 'cry with relief' … 'Now, when I go in and I'm putting on my N95, I think, 'This may only be for a few more weeks,'' said Green …
"Although about 21 million health-care personnel are in the first group to be inoculated, many have not yet received the vaccine, and some remain hesitant. About 12.3 million shots have been administered nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. … On Monday, the nation stood on the brink of another pandemic milestone as the death toll approached 400,000 … More than 151,000 new cases were reported Monday."
Biden will not immediately lift pandemic-related restrictions on international travel. "We plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread," said incoming White House press secretary Jennifer Psaki, responding to Trump's proclamation that he would lift restrictions on travel from Brazil and much of Europe next week.

The virus destroyed a young man’s lungs. His foster mother had to decide whether to let him go.
"Covid-19 had destroyed Elenilson Orellana Garcia's lungs. The 36-year-old teacher's aide, known to friends and family as Nelson, was in his third month on life support and his condition had not improved," Steve Thompson reports. "Doctors at MedStar Washington Hospital Center no longer believed he had the strength to get better. The machines, they said, were just prolonging his suffering. … Doctors had to keep Orellana Garcia sedated and chemically paralyzed as they tried to hold his oxygen levels steady. They said they had done all they could do and it was time to let him go. But [Saundra] Rogers wasn't ready. She had mothered him since he turned up in her bilingual-education classroom in Washington, D.C., a scrawny 10-year-old fresh from El Salvador. Under her care, he had adjusted to a new world, learned English, graduated from high school, become a responsible adult. Many times before, she had refused to give up on him when others might have. …
"Over the decades, Rogers had learned that motherhood meant doing hard things. She no longer believed that what she was doing was giving up. Rather, she thought, it was the last act of mothering she could give her son. … On Jan. 6, Rogers was allowed a final visit to Orellana Garcia's hospital room. … She held his hand and told him how proud she was of him and that it was okay to stop fighting. Behind her, they did something to the machines. He took several deep breaths, and then he was still."

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
On the eve of the inauguration four years ago, Donald Trump likened his "movement" to the one that elected President Andrew Jackson. "There hasn't been anything like this since Andrew Jackson," Trump said. "That was a long time ago!"
Allies such as Rudy Giuliani, Steve Bannon and Newt Gingrich frequently made this comparison. The organizer of Trump's inaugural festivities, Tom Barrack, looked into opening up the White House to the general public for a party that would be modeled on what Jackson hosted when he became the seventh president. "Unfortunately, security concerns are different than they were in 1829," Barrack said in 2017.
When Trump was sworn in, he hung Old Hickory's portrait prominently in the Oval Office, made a pilgrimage to his Nashville estate and blocked plans to replace Jackson on the $20 bill with Harriet Tubman.
But Trump will likely be remembered much more in the category of another 19th-century president from Tennessee. Next week, Trump will become the first president to refuse to attend his successor's inauguration since President Andrew Johnson snubbed Ulysses S. Grant in 1869.
Johnson was the first of three presidents to be impeached. Trump is poised to become the first president to be impeached twice.
While Jackson and Trump both ran as populists, Jackson actually practiced what he preached. Google the Bank War if you have never studied that period. On the other hand, Trump has governed more often as a plutocrat than a populist.
Unlike Jackson, who won reelection in a landslide and has an epoch of U.S. history named for him, Johnson left office after one term. He was loathed by a majority of Americans and denied his party's nomination for a full term.
Historians occasionally debate whether Johnson was the worst president in U.S. history – or just one of the worst two or three. Johnson was a demagogue who played on racial fears as he battled with radical Republicans over Reconstruction. He traveled the country to give long-winded speeches at rallies that oozed with grievance. In one notorious episode, on George Washington's birthday, Johnson gave a speech in which he referred to himself more than 200 times and described congressmen with whom he disagreed as traitors.
Just like the current lame-duck president, Johnson issued a flurry of scandalous pardons during his final Christmas in the White House.
Ironically, Trump's presidency is ending with current and former members of his Cabinet turning on him. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao resigned in protest last week after Trump incited an act of insurrection against the legislative branch, which left five dead. John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff and secretary of homeland security, said he would vote to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump if he was still in the Cabinet. Mick Mulvaney, another former Trump chief of staff and the ex-director of the Office of Management and Budget, resigned his position as Trump's special envoy to Northern Ireland.
Johnson was impeached after firing Edwin Stanton as secretary of war. He had inherited Stanton and the rest of his Cabinet from President Abraham Lincoln. Nervous he would lose reelection in 1864, Lincoln had dumped his first-term vice president, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, for Johnson, a so-called War Democrat who was then the military governor of Tennessee. The unity ticket was part of an effort to appeal to moderates in the border states, and it achieved its intended goal: Lincoln won reelection by 10 points after the Union victory in Atlanta. He carried Tennessee but lost the neighboring state of Kentucky to George McClellan.
Unlike the teetotaler Trump, Johnson was an alcoholic. He showed up drunk to Lincoln's second inauguration. One month later, he became the 17th president.
In lieu of a second impeachment, a growing number of constitutionalscholars andhistorians who specialize in the Reconstruction period are suggesting a remedy from 1868 to punish Trump for his role in last week's events. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment could be used to bar Trump from holding another federal office if he is found to have "engaged in insurrection or rebellion against" the United States. This provision was written largely to prevent Johnson from unilaterally granting blanket pardons to ex-Confederates, without congressional support, that might allow them to run for office again.
"The finding could be accomplished by a simple majority vote of both houses, in contrast to the requirement in impeachment proceedings that the Senate vote to convict by a two-thirds majority," Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman and Indiana University law professor Gerard Magliocca write inan op-ed for today's newspaper. "Congress would simply need to declare that Trump engaged in an act of 'insurrection or rebellion' by encouraging the attack on the Capitol. Under the 14th Amendment, Trump could run for the White House again only if he were able to persuade a future Congress to, 'by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.'"
More political falloutNew details emerge about Trump's initial refusal to act after the mob stormed the Capitol.
"Hiding from the rioters in a secret location away from the Capitol, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) appealed to Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) phoned Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter. And Kellyanne Conway, a longtime Trump confidante and former White House senior adviser, called an aide who she knew was standing at the president's side," Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Phil Rucker report. "But as senators and House members trapped inside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday begged for immediate help during the siege, they struggled to get through to the president, who — safely ensconced in the West Wing — was too busy watching fiery TV images of the crisis unfolding around them to act or even bother to hear their pleas. … 'It took him awhile to appreciate the gravity of the situation,' Graham said in an interview. 'The president saw these people as allies in his journey and sympathetic to the idea that the election was stolen.'
"Trump ultimately — and begrudgingly — urged his supporters to 'go home in peace.' But the six hours between when the Capitol was breached shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday afternoon and when it was finally declared secure around 8 p.m. that evening reveal a president paralyzed … Press officials had begun discussing a statement from Trump around 2 p.m. … But they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the president and could only take the matter to Chief of Staff Mark Meadows … [Donald] Trump Jr. headed to the airport for a shuttle flight home to New York. … An aide called Trump Jr. and suggested he immediately issue a statement urging the rioters to stop. At 2:17 p.m., Trump Jr. hit send on a tweet as he boarded the plane: 'This is wrong and not who we are,' he wrote. … But the president himself was busy enjoying the spectacle. …
"McCarthy did eventually reach Trump, but later told allies that he found the president distracted. So McCarthy repeatedly appeared on television to describe the mayhem, an adviser said, in an effort to explain just how dire the situation was. … At one point, Trump worried that the unruly group was frightening GOP lawmakers from doing his bidding and objecting to the election results.… [Around 4 p.m.], the White House was preparing to put out a video address on behalf of the president. … Trump aides did three takes of the video and chose the most palatable option — despite some West Wing consternation that the president had called the violent protesters 'very special.' …
"The following evening, on Thursday, Trump released another video, the closest advisers say he is likely to come to a concession speech. … His calls for healing and reconciliation were more than a day too late, many aides said. Yet as Trump watched the media coverage of his video, he grew angry. The president said he wished he hadn't done it … because he feared that the calming words made him look weak."

Shortly before convening a conference call of House Republicans later in the day, McCarthy sent a memo floating several alternatives to impeachment, including a censure resolution, a bipartisan investigative commission and changes to the law governing the counting of electoral votes. On the call with his GOP colleagues, McCarthy said Trump privately agreed that he bore some responsibility for Wednesday's riot, according to two Republicans who heard his remarks.

New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, a key Trump supporter in 2016, announced that he will no longer accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom award from him on Thursday. He said he had agreed to accept the award before last week's violence. "Above all, I am an American citizen with great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy," Belichick said in a statement. (Cindy Boren and Mark Maske)
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) holds Trump responsible for inciting the mob. "I called and texted my closest contact at the White House to urge that the president immediately tell the rioters to stop their violence and go home. But Trump completely undercut that message by repeating his grievances and telling the rioters that he knew how they felt," Collins writes in the Bangor Daily News.
A narrow majority of Americans – 52 percent – say Trump should be removed from office, and 53 percent say he should resign, per a new Quinnipiac poll. The same survey shows Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 33 percent, matching his previous all-time low in the aftermath of Charlottesville in 2017.
A group of 24 former House Republican lawmakers endorsed impeaching Trump.In an open letter, they say "there is no excuse for nor defense of a President of the United States to actively orchestrate an insurrection on a separate but coequal branch of government."
William Webster, the former federal judge, FBI director and CIA director, endorses Trump's impeachment. "I'm a lifelong Republican, but I am an American first," he writes in an op-ed for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. "Never in my 96 years did I imagine a sitting president of the United States, abetted by numerous members of Congress, using tools of deception and innuendo to challenge the will of the American people in choosing their leadership. Abraham Lincoln warned us that 'America will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.'"
Pence and Trump are speaking again.
"Vice President Pence was in hiding from a violent mob of Trump supporters in the Capitol last Wednesday when the presidential tweet attacking him posted. 'Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution,'" Trump tweeted at 2:24 p.m., Dawsey and Parker report. "Trump never called him that day or in the days following to make sure Pence was okay — or to discuss a governmental response to the deadly riots the president incited. … A senior administration official said Trump and Pence finally met in the Oval Office on Monday night and 'had a good conversation, discussing the week ahead and reflecting on the last four years of the administration's work and accomplishments.' Pence is under pressure from Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment … but he is not expected to do so, aides said. Trump's treatment of Pence has reverberated badly in the White House and among campaign aides, many of whom see it as unseemly and unfair. One senior administration official described it as 'unconscionable, even for the president.'"

Trump has been advised he potentially could face civil liability connected to his role in encouraging the mob.
"'Think O.J.,' an adviser explained it to Trump, according to one source. It was a reference to O.J. Simpson, who was found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife and a friend but later faced stiff civil damages after being sued by his ex-wife's family," ABC News reports."Prior to Wednesday, the president and his advisers had been discussing a self-pardon – something that would be both historic and untested in American history – in the wake of a phone call with Trump and Georgia election officials that was made public. The sources say if the president were to self-pardon, it would only strengthen the motivation to bring civil cases against the 45th president."
Trump's private business failed to pay a $49,000 hotel bill incurred during his 2017 inaugural — and then, after the bill went to a collections agency, Trump's nonprofit inaugural committee improperly agreed to pay the charge instead, according to a new filing from the D.C. attorney general. D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine (D) added this to charge to his lawsuit alleging that Trump wasted donors' money on an overpriced, barely used ballroom at his own hotel. (David Fahrenthold)
New York City is considering ending contracts with Trump's companies that bring him $17 million a year.

Rudy Giuliani could be disbarred.
The New York State Bar Association will consider expelling Trump's personal lawyer, and a state lawmaker is seeking his disbarment after inflammatory comments during a rally preceding last week's deadly insurrection. "In a statement Monday, the bar association said it has received 'hundreds of complaints in recent months' about the former New York mayor and his failed bid to help Trump overturn his loss," Shayna Jacobs reports. "'Mr. Giuliani's words quite clearly were intended to encourage Trump supporters unhappy with the election's outcome to take matters into their own hands,' a spokeswoman for the group, Susan DeSantis, said in the statement. … New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Democrat who represents parts of Manhattan, filed a formal complaint to an appellate court related to 'rampant and egregious violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct' and Giuliani's 'complicity' in inciting last week's violence. … Speaking to a charged crowd of thousands near the White House on Wednesday, Giuliani said: 'If we're wrong, we will be made fools of, but if we're right, a lot of them will go to jail. So let's have trial by combat!'"
More law enforcement falloutSeveral Capitol Police officers suspended, and more than a dozen are under investigation.
"Eight separate investigations have been launched into the actions of Capitol officers," Aaron Davis, Rebecca Tan and Beth Reinhard report. "In one of the cases, officers had posted what Capitol Police investigators found to be messages showing support for the rally on Wednesday that preceded the attack on the complex, including touting Trump's baseless contention that the election had been stolen through voter fraud. … Investigators in another instance found that a Capitol officer had posted 'inappropriate' images of Biden on a social media account. … House and Senate lawmakers have called for investigations into the security failures … On Monday, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), whose committee has financial oversight of the Capitol Police, told reporters in a video conference call that one of those suspended was captured in images of the riot that went viral online. The photo appears to show a Capitol officer allowing or even posing for a rioter to take a picture with the officer. … The other officer who was suspended was seen outside the complex wearing a red Make America Great Again baseball cap at the time rioters were surrounding the Capitol, Ryan said."
Chad Wolf resigns as acting homeland security secretary.
"Wolf, who was overseas in the Middle East last week during the siege, attributed his decision to 'recent events' and court rulings that have challenged the legality of his appointment by the Trump administration to run the department," Nick Miroff and Carol Leonnig report. "In a statement to Department of Homeland Security staff, Wolf said he was 'saddened to take this step,' having previously announced plans to remain on the job through the end of the Trump administration. … Chase Jennings, a DHS spokesman, said Wolf will remain at the department in his Senate-confirmed role as undersecretary for strategy, policy and plans. …
"Several lawmakers have called for hearings to question why Wolf and DHS failed to anticipate threats posed by Trump's followers … In one of his final moves as acting secretary Monday, Wolf announced that the U.S. Secret Service would take over security preparations for the inauguration on Wednesday, six days ahead of schedule … Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called Wolf's decision to step down Monday 'questionable.' 'He has chosen to resign during a time of national crisis and when domestic terrorists may be planning additional attacks on our government,' Thompson said."
Up to 15,000 National Guard members could be deployed to D.C. for the inauguration.
That announcement was made "as lawmakers questioned the military's ability to respond quickly to domestic crises and urged a crackdown on possible extremists in its ranks," Dan Lamothe reports. "A contingent of 340 D.C. National Guard members had been activated ahead of the riot … But the guardsmen were unarmed and mostly on traffic duty in other parts of the District, in a limited mission that city officials had approved. Once the riot began, lawmakers and D.C. officials pleaded with defense officials to send National Guard members to help, but none arrived for hours as details were finalized … Defense officials have since activated thousands of National Guard members, with 6,000 in the city as of Monday, said Army Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau. Up to 10,000 are expected to be deployed by Saturday, with the possibility for even more on the streets by the inauguration on Jan. 20, he said. … The National Guard members will carry weapons based on discussions with the FBI, police and other agencies."
The FBI warns that armed far-right extremist groups plan to march on state capitals this weekend.
"The memo is something of a raw intelligence product, compiling information gathered by the bureau and several other government agencies," Tim Craig, Holly Bailey and Matt Zapotosky report."Some of it is unverified, and the threat is likely to differ significantly from place to place, though the memo said there were plans in all 50 state capitals … But the data points it highlights for law enforcement are nonetheless troubling — including that there was information suggesting people might storm government offices, or stage an uprising were Trump to be removed from office. … On Monday, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) announced that he was activating the National Guard to provide support for the Capitol Police in Madison. … In Arizona, officials had erected a double-layer chain-link fence around the Capitol complex in Phoenix. … Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) called up 750 National Guard troops to help protect the Capitol, where the legislature kicked off its annual session Monday."
"Another right-wing group stormed the state capitol in Salem, Ore., trying to break into the building while legislators met for a special session on Dec. 21. The capitol's locked doors kept the crowd at bay — until Republican state Rep. Mike Nearman coolly walked through an exit and held the doors open as far-right demonstrators raced inside," Katie Shepherd reports. "On Monday, after surveillance video showing Nearman's role in the incursion became public, his colleagues stripped his committee assignments, restricted his access to the capitol building, and fined him for the damage caused by the crowd after he opened the door. … Few Republicans have publicly criticized Nearman."
In a call last night, Capitol Police briefed House members on three potential plots.
"The first is a demonstration billed as the 'largest armed protest ever to take place on American soil.' Another is a protest in honor of Ashli Babbitt, the woman killed while trying to climb into the Speaker's Lobby during Wednesday's pro-Trump siege of the Capitol. And another demonstration, which three members said was by far the most concerning plot, would involve insurrectionists forming a perimeter around the Capitol, the White House and the Supreme Court, and then blocking Democrats from entering the Capitol ― perhaps even killing them ― so that Republicans could take control of the government," HuffPost reports. "'It was pretty overwhelming,' one member said. … Lawmakers were told that the plot to encircle the Capitol also included plans to surround the White House ― so that no one could harm Trump ― and the Supreme Court, simply to shut down the courts. … All of these plots may never materialize. The Capitol Police have established a new perimeter with fencing and razor wire … But while Capitol Police assured members they were prepared for these terrorist plots, there was obvious concern from a number of lawmakers."
D.C. leaders issue urgent pleas for Americans to stay away next week.
"'If I'm scared of anything it's for our democracy,' D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said at a Monday news conference, responding to a reporter who asked if she feared what might happen on Inauguration Day. 'Because we have factions in our country . . . that are armed and dangerous,'" Emily Davies reports. "Bowser, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) held a joint call on Monday to discuss planning for the 59th presidential inauguration and agreed to discourage all in-person attendance in the interest of public safety. … One online post cited by Alethea Group, an anti-disinformation organization, has called for an 'ARMED MARCH ON CAPITOL HILL & ALL STATE CAPITOLS.' Others have discussed a 'Million Militia March' on Inauguration Day. … Bowser, who said she will be briefed by the FBI daily on threats to the city, warned that demonstrations across the country may mean states will rethink their ability to lend help. That could be especially dangerous at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has hamstrung the city's emergency response teams. On average, the D.C. fire department is operating with a 10 percent reduction in staffing from coronavirus infection and exposure."

More on the transitionBiden scrambles to prevent impeachment from hampering his first 100 days.
The president-elect called the Senate parliamentarian on Monday to ask whether the chamber could simultaneously hold a trial of Trump and pass urgently needed bills for covid relief. Biden told reporters in Delaware that he asked about how to "bifurcate" the schedule so that his nominees can get confirmed and bills can advance during a morning session before the trial proceeds in the afternoon. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) explored other, little-used ways of speeding up Senate action.
"Some officials who have been involved in past impeachment proceedings said it would be difficult, if not impossible, to bifurcate the Senate's work as Biden has proposed," Seung Min Kim, Annie Linskey and Dawsey report."There could be further delays if legal challenges are mounted to determine whether a former president can face impeachment. And Senate Republicans would have little incentive to work with Biden to speed things along and enact his agenda. All those factors are putting enormous pressure on Schumer to decide how to negotiate the political crosscurrents. He said in an interview published Monday that he considered impeaching Trump and executing Biden's agenda equally important. …
"The Senate is not scheduled to come into session until Jan. 19 … That has prompted Schumer to explore an obscure authority that would allow him, along with the current majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), to jointly reconvene the Senate in cases of emergency … But McConnell would have to agree to such a maneuver, and it is far from clear that he would. Aides to McConnell — who had ignored Trump's calls before Wednesday's siege and now has no plans to call him back, according to one official — did not immediately respond to requests for comment. …
"Over the weekend, Schumer quietly advised his fellow Senate Democrats not to take the prospect of impeachment off the table in their interviews and public comments … In addition, Schumer told senators not to float censure as a potential option for punishing Trump, since most Democrats believe that would let Republicans off the hook by providing a way for them to impose a toothless penalty on Trump. … Biden and Pelosi discussed impeachment when they spoke Friday, and Biden suggested he was agnostic on whether lawmakers go forward."
Democratic control of the Senate will allow repeals of last-minute Trump policies.
The Trump "administration put out three to four times its usual volume of rules in recent months, according to estimates by Daniel Pérez, an analyst at George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center," the WSJ reports. "Such measures, known as midnight regulations, are often vulnerable to rollback by an incoming administration of the opposing party. Agency heads appointed by a new president can scrap rules that have been finalized but not yet published in the Federal Register or delay implementation of ones that have been published but haven't taken effect. And they can decline to defend rules challenged in court. But control of both chambers of Congress by the president's party unlocks an additional tool. The Congressional Review Act, or CRA, allows the Senate and House of Representatives to overturn regulations finalized by the executive branch in the previous 60 legislative days using a fast-track process that requires a simple majority vote. Most other legislation requires 60 votes to clear the Senate."
Biden has said little publicly about his criminal justice plans.
"Many say that the credibility Biden earned among civil rights leaders as vice president to Barack Obama, combined with his long-standing ties with law enforcement, including his work on the 1994 crime bill, make him well-positioned to bridge divides among law enforcement officials and civilians pushing for change,"per Tim Craig, Mark Berman, Amy Wang, Tom Jackman, Matt Zapotosky, Emily Wax-Thibodeaux and Justin Jouvenal.

Doug Emhoff, the incoming second gentleman, is stepping away from legal work.
"Political spouses seldom cause a ripple, but sometimes they can be a liability," Manuel Roig-Franzia reports. "Emhoff presented a more complex set of questions. Over the years, alongside the boilerplate corporate and real estate work, [the lawyer] has sometimes represented heavily regulated companies or firms that might be frowned upon on the left. … The cases that have gotten the most attention lately, though, have been the quirkiest. He succeeded in shielding an advertising agency from paying a massive judgment in a case involving the origins of the Chihuahua featured in Taco Bell advertisements. … The closest parallel for Emhoff may be Marilyn Quayle, the wife of President George H.W. Bush's vice president, Dan Quayle. She made inquiries about resuming her legal career when her husband took office, but her plans fizzled amid conflict-of-interest sniping and reluctance within firms to open themselves to undue scrutiny."
The coronavirusThree House Democrats who tested positive for covid blame GOP colleagues who refused to wear masks.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) prepared for the worst after she was forced to take shelter last week for several hours in a crowded committee room. Many of the GOP members of Congress hiding out with her were not wearing masks, she said, and had refused to accept them from a colleague. After Congress voted to affirm Biden's victory, she began to quarantine. Sure enough, Jayapal announced late Monday that she has tested positive, joining Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.). A third lawmaker, Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), said Tuesday morning that he, too, had tested positive after spending "several hours in a secure but confined location with dozens of other Members of Congress."
The Trump administration will announce sweeping changes to its vaccination rollout.
New guidelines will make many more doses of the coronavirus vaccine available and urge states to provide shots to anyone 65 years old and older. The changes come days after Biden announced plans to release nearly all the vaccine supply. "The Trump administration has been holding back roughly half the vaccines to ensure sufficient supply for people to get a required second shot. But in draft remarks prepared for a scheduled call Tuesday afternoon with governors and obtained by The Washington Post, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar disclosed the change in plans," Lena Sun and Laurie McGinley report.
The FDA cycled through three top lawyers Monday in a clash with HHS.
"The unusual sequence began with Trump appointee Stacy Cline Amin abruptly stepping down as chief counsel and the FDA announcing that career civil servant Mark Raza would be her acting replacement. Then, HHS on Monday night announced that Trump political appointee James Lawrence would instead serve as chief counsel — a move that unnerved health officials as the Trump administration heads into its final week. Two officials said that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows backed Lawrence as FDA's top lawyer, per Politico. "Three FDA officials said they were bracing for HHS to push through additional last-minute policy changes, noting that HHS on Monday announced new deregulatory policies that were partly steered by Lawrence. The moves, which roll back some of FDA's reviews, were opposed by the agency and its allies."
The CDC says there’s no sign of a homegrown U.S. virus variant.
"Infectious-disease experts say there is no evidence the massive winter surge that is killing thousands of people a day in the United States is linked to the U.K. variant or to a homegrown strain. But they acknowledge their battlefield awareness is limited," Joel Achenbach, Kim Bellware and Hamza Shaban report. "Some states have minimal capacity to conduct genomic sequencing that allows scientists to trace the random mutations that could give a virus variant some advantage over other strains. Like any virus, this one mutates randomly, and countless variants are in circulation. The increase in the rate of new infections in the United States has been so rapid in recent weeks that scientists cannot rule out the possibility that an undetected variant is accelerating the spread. Other factors may be behind the surge, including holiday gatherings and the lack of adherence in some communities to public health guidelines designed to limit transmission, such as social distancing and wearing masks. …
"Nearly 198,000 new coronavirus cases and more than 1,600 deaths were reported Monday in the United States. The seven-day running average for daily deaths has topped 3,200. Nearly 375,000 people have died of the virus in the nation since the beginning of the pandemic. … The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday its strain surveillance program and its partners are on track to more than double by week's end the number of genomic sequences being uploaded to public databases compared with the sequencing rate in December."

Taylor Swift has recorded and released two albums since President Trump and Congress last passed coronavirus relief.
"I've been down since July," the pop star announces at the start of the title track for "Evermore," her surprise new CD that dropped at midnight. "I had a feeling so peculiar that this pain would be forevermore."
The five-minute song takes listeners on a journey from the depths of pandemic-induced melancholy to a feeling of reassurance that things cannot possibly stay this bad. The piano ballad leaves you with a sense of hope for the future. Perhaps it will emerge as the anthem for 2020.
In what sounds like a metaphor for the carnage and havoc wrought by the coronavirus, Swift refers to death and says she has felt "barefoot in the wildest winter."
"Hey December," she sings. "Guess I'm feeling unmoored. Can't remember what I used to fight for. I rewind the tape, but all it does is pause on the very moment all was lost."
The song becomes a duet as Justin Vernon from the indie folk band Bon Iver chimes in during the bridge. "Can't not think of all the cost and the things that will be lost," he says. "Oh, can we just get a pause? To be certain, we'll be tall again – whether weather be the frost or the violence of the dog days. I'm on waves, out being tossed."
"When I was shipwrecked, I thought of you," Swift continues. "In the cracks of light, I dreamed of you. It was real enough to get me through. … I was catching my breath, floors of a cabin creaking under my step, and I couldn't be sure. I had a feeling so peculiar this pain wouldn't be forevermore."
The album became available at the end of a day with as many ups and downs as the song. A record 3,347 covid-19 deaths were reported by state health departments, putting America's death toll on course to surpass 300,000 in the coming days. "We are in the time frame now that, probably for the next 60 to 90 days, we're going to have more deaths per day than we had at 9/11 or we had at Pearl Harbor," CDC Director Robert Redfield said Thursday to the Council on Foreign Relations.
The Labor Department announced a few hours earlier thatthe number of new unemployment claims last week rose sharply to 853,000, an increase of 137,000 from the week before. This is worse than the very worst jobs report during the Great Recession in March 2009.
In the evening, a panel of federal advisers voted to endorse the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, making FDA authorization all but certain in the coming hours. Americans will probably start getting inoculated this weekend.
"Evermore" is a follow-up to"Folklore," which came out on July 24. Swift said the isolation and inability to tour during the pandemic has made her prolific. "To put it plainly, we just couldn't stop writing songs," she wrote on Instagram. "To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in. …
"I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales," she explained. "I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives. So I just kept writing them."
Swift, who turns 31 on Sunday, has spoken publicly about past periods of apparent depression. This is her ninth studio album. "Folklore" came out just 11 months after "Lover," her previous album. That prolific run of new content comes after Swift took three years to release "Reputation" in 2017 after her previous album, "1989," was a smash success. In a radio interview last year, Swift said that the long delay was because she needed a mental break and was not feeling "fresh" enough to create new music.
"There have been times where I needed to take years off because I just felt exhausted, or I felt like, really low or really bad," she told Zach Sang in April 2019. "One thing to always keep tabs on is the fact that we have to know that there is no 'happily ever after' where we're just happy forever. Happiness is always going to be a struggle and a challenge that we have to try and meet. … That's not naturally how we're going to feel all the time."
Swift has evolved from country to pop to something that sounds more like alternative rock in these two most recent albums. One of the reasons many sophisticated people admire Swift, despite her bubblegum Top 40 background, is because her lyrics often allude with clever imagery to classic literature and poetry. "Evermore" is no different.
In an unusual move, Swift puts the title track as the 15th and final song. The kicker is her saying: "This pain wouldn't be forevermore."
Emily Dickinson ended her poem, "One Sister Have I in Our House," this way: "I spilt the dew / But took the morn, / I chose this single star / From out the wide night's numbers / Sue - forevermore!"
Dickinson's birthday was Thursday.
More on the economyStimulus talks are in disarray as deadlines loom.
"Congressional bickering over a new economic relief package escalated Thursday as lawmakers traded blame and put negotiations over critical legislation on the brink of collapse. And the finger-pointing even threatened to imperil a must-pass spending bill in the Senate, as lawmakers were still unsure whether they would be able to pass a measure by a deadline Friday night to avert a government shutdown," Mike DeBonis and Jeff Stein report. "The worsening situation came as multiple lawmakers appeared to be pursuing conflicting goals, with little time to sort out disagreements. The House passed a spending bill Wednesday to fund the government for one week and avoid a shutdown deadline Friday night. The Senate must pass an identical bill — and have Trump sign it — to avoid a shutdown, but as of Thursday afternoon, lawmakers still weren't sure how to do that with unanimous consent.
"Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) suggested Thursday that discussions over emergency legislation could stretch beyond Christmas, even though multiple critical programs expire at the end of this month and there are fresh signs the economy is weakening. … Further adding to the confusion, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) on Thursday threatened the must-pass government spending bill in an attempt to force congressional leadership to allow a vote on another round of $1,200 stimulus checks next week. … Staffers for [Mitch] McConnell also told leadership offices in both parties Wednesday night that McConnell sees no possible path for a bipartisan group of lawmakers to reach an agreement on two contentious provisions that would be broadly acceptable to Senate Republicans … House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said House lawmakers would be sent home to their districts until a compromise measure was reached."
Stealing to survive, more Americans shoplift food and baby formula as aid runs out.
"In Maryland, Jean was successfully juggling college and a job, and had just bought her first car, when the pandemic crashed down like a sneaker wave. Her son's day-care center suddenly closed in April, forcing her to give up her $15-an-hour job as a receptionist. But quitting meant she didn't qualify for unemployment benefits. She says she was denied food stamps at least three times and gave up on local food banks because of the lines," Abha Bhattarai and Hannah Denham report. "So she began sneaking food into her son's stroller at the local Walmart. She said she'd take things like ground beef, rice or potatoes but always pay for something small, like a packet of M&M's. Each time, she'd tell herself that God would understand. …
"That tided her over until July, when she got a big break: a full-time job in a new state making $16 an hour. Jean has health insurance now and donates to the local food pantry. She hopes she'll never have to steal again, though she says her sense of security is fleeting. 'I know what it's like to do everything you can and still not make it,' she said. 'And I know it could happen again.'"
More on the vaccineFDA authorization is all but certain after federal advisers endorse the Pfizer vaccine.
"The thumbs' up from the FDA's vaccine advisory committee was the culmination of an all-day meeting during which the panel heard presentations on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, including plans to monitor its longer-term safety." Laurie McGinley, Carolyn Johnson and Joel Achenbach report."After the FDA authorization, an advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will vote on whether to recommend the vaccine and for which groups. … States will have the final say on who gets the first shots and where they are administered. Those considerations are complicated by extreme logistics challenges, including the sub-Antarctic storage temperatures the vaccine requires. …
"The FDA has asked Pfizer to monitor vaccine recipients for 'anaphylactic reactions' as a potential risk following the British report. Much remains unknown about the cases in the United Kingdom, and experts said more data was urgently needed. A specific study could be done to see if the vaccine carried risk to people with severe allergies — data that might be essential to overcome concerns from Americans who heard alarming news reports. … In its review, the FDA found a slightly higher number of adverse events — 'potentially representing allergic reactions' — in the group that received the vaccine, compared with those who got the placebo. There were 137 'hypersensitivity-related' reactions to the vaccine, compared with 111 such events in the placebo group. But there were no cases of anaphylactic reactions in the trial. Pregnant women have been excluded from coronavirus vaccine trials, but the FDA's limited data suggests no specific risk to pregnant women or a fetus. …
"The FDA will release its assessment of [Moderna's] vaccine on Tuesday and the advisory committee will review it on Dec. 17. If it gets favorable evaluations, as expected, the FDA is likely to authorize that vaccine within days. … Despite the committee's consensus that the vaccine is safe and effective, there was at least one cautionary note about the absence of long-term data. A. Oveta Fuller, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan, voted against the recommendation, expressing concerns about the lack of long-term safety data for a vaccine technology not used before in humans. She called the risk 'limited' but predicted 'the uptake in the community is going to be very poor.'"

The Australian government ended the trial of a vaccine developed at the University of Queensland after some patients received false-positive HIV tests. The vaccine was developed using a coronavirus spike protein and a protein from the human immunodeficiency virus that could not infect people, but still stimulated the production of antibodies in some trial participants. The antibodies then spurred the false-positive HIV tests. (Sydney Morning Herald)

For some Americans, the vaccine can’t come soon enough. Others take a wait-and-see approach.
"Maribel Martinez has no qualms about getting the coronavirus vaccine. She watched as covid-19 attacked and weakened her husband for days during the summer before he relented and went to the hospital. He survived, but the experience so shook Martinez that she is determined to get the vaccine as soon as it is available. She said that puts her out of step with most of her friends and neighbors in a predominantly Latino neighborhood in Baltimore where many are resistant to the idea of inoculation," Ian Duncan and Arelis Hernández report. "'We have a big problem,' said Martinez, 43. 'The majority of the people around me are relying on what they hear from others, see on social media or their religious beliefs without knowing what it is to have the virus.' … There are swaths of people who, like Martinez's neighbors, are apprehensive. For many, the speed with which the vaccines have been developed and evaluated by the Trump administration is reason to be cautious. … 'They really rushed,' said [Iowa truck driver Candace Marley, who frets about bringing the virus home from the road]. 'Even if they make us a priority, I'll probably wait a couple months after they start to see how everyone else is handling it.'"
Trump’s polarizing approach complicates Joe Biden’s push for a unified response.
"Trump's erratic, unrealistic and untruthful leadership during the U.S. pandemic response left the country poorly prepared for the concerted fight," Christopher Rowland reports. Biden "must counsel patience and continued mask-wearing. … At the same time, he will need to embark on a comprehensive education campaign to convince people that it is in their — and their neighbors' — best interest to get vaccinated. … The slow buildup of vaccine stockpiles through the first half of 2021 will give more time for leaders to mount that persuasion campaign for those showing early reluctance … Overcoming that hesitancy will require a broad-based education campaign from federal, state and local governments, featuring corporate and religious leaders, celebrities, sports stars and influencers, say experts. They will be up against an explosion of disinformation."
Faces of the fallenThe GOP speaker of the New Hampshire House dies suddenly of covid.
Richard Hinch, 71, "died just a week after he was sworn in as speaker — and about three weeks after an indoor meeting of his caucus that led to several members contracting the virus, an event that Mr. Hinch had tried to play down in public remarks," the New York Times reports."The news will undoubtedly heighten tensions among state lawmakers, who have been at odds over the refusal of many Republican lawmakers to wear masks or take other pandemic precautions seriously. Splits have opened not just along partisan lines but also within the Republican ranks. … The Democratic former speaker, Steve Shurtleff, said he was troubled by Mr. Hinch's support of Republican lawmakers who refused to wear masks on the House floor, whom Mr. Hinch had called the 'patriot section' and the 'freedom group.' 'It's so ironic, looking back,' Mr. Shurtleff said. 'I know he was just doing his job as a Republican leader, defending his members and his caucus, but it seems so senseless now.'"
A candidate for a Texas judgeship dies six days before a runoff election.
"Lillian E. Blancas, a widely respected lawyer in El Paso, always wanted to be a judge. She was expected to achieve her goal on Saturday in a runoff election, in which she was the favorite," the Times reports. "Ms. Blancas died at a hospital in the city on Monday. She was 47. The cause was Covid-19, her brother Moises Blancas said. … Her death came too late to remove her name from the ballot. If she wins, the City Council would appoint a replacement. … Among her many friends, who called her Lila, was her opponent in the runoff, Enrique A. Holguin, who met her in 2013 when he joined the district attorney's office. … Ms. Blancas tested positive for Covid on Halloween; three days later, she won 40 percent of the vote in the election, sending her and Mr. Holguin to a runoff. … After the election, Mr. Holguin, her opponent, texted her his congratulations. "You're going to have a head start, because I have Covid,' Mr. Holguin said she responded. 'I was ready to lose this election,' he said, 'but I wasn't ready to lose a friend.'"
A woman dies from covid five days after she was supposed to get married.
"Stephanie Lynn Smith and Jamie Bassett were looking forward to getting married Nov. 13. They had planned for Smith's older brother to officiate the wedding in front of their parents at a scaled-down ceremony in a field in Lubbock, Texas, where Bassett had proposed," NBC News reports. "But the couple did not marry. Smith spent her wedding day in a hospital where she had tested positive for the coronavirus and was diagnosed with pneumonia. … Five days later, Bassett and Smith's family would rush to the hospital, only to learn that she had died. She was 29."

D.C. says it is being shortchanged on vaccines for health-care workers, but federal officials are sticking with their decision to allocate doses based on a jurisdiction's population instead of its workforce. Around 75 percent of the District's 85,000 health-care workers commute in from Maryland and Virginia. As a result, the District expects to receive just 6,825 doses of the vaccine in its first shipment. (Lola Fadulu)
Despite the objection of two board members, Metro leaders moved a step closer to adopting a plan that severely cuts transit service. If Congress or the incoming Biden administration were to provide federal aid, cuts could be rolled back, board members said. Without aid, Metro has proposed eliminating weekend Metrorail service, while ending weekday service two hours early. Fewer trains would mean waits between 15 and 30 minutes. Metrobus routes would be cut by more than half. (Justin George)

The voting warsTrump and his dead-enders amplify pressure on the Supreme Court.
"In a morning tweet, Trump called on the court to 'save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States,' repeating his baseless claims of widespread fraud. He had a private lunch at the White House with some of the attorneys general from 18 Republican-led states asking the court to dismiss the results in four swing states that Biden won, an effort supported by the Trump administration," David Nakamura and Robert Barnes report. "By late afternoon, 106 GOP House members — a majority of the 196-member Republican caucus — had signed on to an amicus brief to support the Texas-led motion, among them Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) and Rep. Tom Emmer (Minn.), the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee. … Democrats denounced the last-ditch legal effort — filed this week by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a staunch Trump supporter who attended the White House lunch — to negate 10.4 million votes in favor of Biden in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. … Each of the targeted states filed an objection to Texas's intentions and, taken together, offered the court a wide range of reasons not to get involved. … Legal experts predicted that the Supreme Court will quickly dismiss the Texas filing."
Quote of the day
"Texas has not suffered harm simply because it dislikes the result of the election, and nothing in the text, history, or structure of the Constitution supports Texas's view that it can dictate the manner in which four other states run their elections," Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D) wrotein his response to the Supreme Court. "Texas does not seek to have the Court interpret the Constitution, so much as disregard it."

A handful of Republicans express principled opposition to this assault on democracy.
Among them was Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.), who was formerly chief of staff to Sen. Ted Cruz (R). Cruz, who definitely knows better, has agreed to argue the Texas lawsuit if the Supreme Court takes it up. The senator is pretty clearly doing this to further his 2024 presidential ambitions, even if it means further squandering his reputation as a serious lawyer. On Twitter, Roy distanced himself from his old boss by explaining that this case "represents a dangerous violation of federalism" and "sets a precedent to have one state asking federal courts to police the voting procedures of other states." Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) chastised his colleagues who signed the brief in a video: "The election was real — it counts — and we need to move forward. Failing to accept this reality puts the country in a very dangerous moment in time." Felicia Sonmez notes that only one member of House GOP leadership signed onto the amicus brief: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.).
Rush Limbaugh floats the startling notion of secession.
"Rush Limbaugh isn't saying he wants the country to split into red and blue factions as a result of conservative fury over the election results. As he attempted to make clear Thursday, he's just saying that other people are saying it," Paul Farhi reports. "'I know that there's a sizable and growing sentiment for people who believe that's we're headed to, whether we want to get there or not, secession,' he said on his nationwide radio program. 'Now, I didn't advocate for it. I never would advocate for secession. I'm simply repeating what I have heard.' Limbaugh's clarification came after his earlier comments on the topic went viral on social media. He didn't say where he's heard anyone float the notion of states seceding, let alone spell out how such a neo-Civil War separation might take place. … 'I actually think that we're trending toward secession,' he said on Wednesday's show. 'I see more and more people asking what in the world do we have in common with the people who live in, say, New York?'" For what it's worth, Limbaugh spent much of his career broadcasting from New York.
The lame-duck agendaMorocco and Israel will establish diplomatic relations.
"Morocco and Israel agreed Thursday to establish diplomatic relations in a deal brokered by the United States, making the North African nation the fourth Arab-majority country in recent months to say it would normalize ties with Israel. The agreement with Morocco had been anticipated for months, but was held up by Moroccan demands that the United States recognize its sovereignty over a disputed border region," Anne Gearan, Karoun Demirjian, Mike DeBonis and Souad Mekhennet report. "That logjam broke this month, as Trump's tenure nears its end. No other Western democracy has backed Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara region, and Trump's turnabout ends more than 40 years of official neutrality. Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), a Trump ally and powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has championed the cause of Algerian-backed separatists in that region for years. 'He could have made this deal without trading away the rights of this voiceless people,' Inhofe said on the Senate floor, referring to Trump. Trump's decision came a week after he had criticized Inhofe for refusing to hold up the annual defense spending bill over Trump's demand that it be used to repeal a federal law granting liability protection to technology companies."

The Trump administration is considering whether to pull back military support for the CIA's counterterrorism efforts, the Times reports. One option under consideration by the administration would reduce the number of Pentagon personnel sent to the agency, while another, broader change would make it harder for the agency to work out of military bases.
The Trump administration executes Brandon Bernard.
This is one of five death sentences that Trump's team hopes to carry out before an opponent of capital punishment replaces him. "This schedule has spurred significant pushback, with critics arguing against carrying out a wave of executions in the narrow window before Biden, who opposes capital punishment, takes office," Mark Berman reports."Bernard's case had drawn high-profile condemnation, with Kim Kardashian West, among others, tweeting about his case and sharing a petition calling for his death sentence to be commuted to life in prison. On Thursday evening, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Bernard's stay request, clearing the way for his execution to proceed. The court's three liberal justices — Stephen G. Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor — said they would have granted the stay. … Bernard was the ninth federal death-row inmate executed this year. Bernard and Christopher Vialva, his co-defendant, were convicted of murder in 2000 for their roles in the killing of two youth ministers, Todd and Stacie Bagley, the previous year. … Bernard was 18 at the time."

Biden says the GOP used “defund the police” to “beat the living hell” out of Democrats.
"Biden appeared to blame the 'defund the police' movement for contributing to surprising Democratic down-ballot losses last month, telling civil rights leaders this week that they should proceed carefully on criminal justice issues," NBC News reports. "'That's how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we're talking about defunding the police. We're not. We're talking about holding them accountable,' Biden said Tuesday in a virtual meeting with civil rights leaders, according to audio excerpts posted Thursday in a podcast from The Intercept. Biden pledged that he would follow through on his promises to address systemic racism, but he warned about getting 'too far ahead of ourselves' with critical Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5."
During the meeting, civil rights leaders urged Biden to take a slew of executive actions. He said there are some things he'll be able to do by executive order, but he's "not going to violate the Constitution. Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bounds." (Intercept)
Attorney General Bill Barr has known about a disparate set of investigations involving Hunter Biden's business and financial dealings since at least this spring, but he worked to avoid their public disclosure during the campaign, his allies told the Wall Street Journal.
Barr has told others that he plans on staying in his job through Jan. 20, the Times reports. Trump was irritated with Barr's contemplation of an early departure.
The Supreme Court rules in favor of Muslims placed on no-fly list after refusing to become FBI informants.
"The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that three Muslim men may seek monetary damages from the government agents they say placed them on a no-fly list because they refused to become FBI informants," Robert Barnes reports. "The men filed a lawsuit in 2013 under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which provides relief from government actions that substantially burden a person's religious beliefs. 'The question here is whether 'appropriate relief' includes claims for money damages against government officials in their individual capacities. We hold that it does,' Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the 8-0 court. Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed after the case was argued in October and did not take part in the decision. Muhammad Tanvir, Jameel Algibhah and Naveed Shinwari alleged that in separate incidents, they were asked to spy on their friends and fellow congregants at mosques in the New York area. They refused and later discovered that they were placed on the no-fly list … Each of the plaintiffs in the case were uniquely vulnerable to the hindrances of the no-fly list; they all had wives or family abroad, giving them a powerful incentive to comply with the FBI's demands."
Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) blocks votes to establish Smithsonian museums for Latinos and women.
"Lee blocked consideration for legislation to establish a National Museum of the American Latino and an American Women's History Museum as part of the Smithsonian Institution, reasoning that the US does not need 'separate but equal museums.' The National Museum of the American Latino legislation had passed the House by voice vote in July following decades of efforts to establish the museum," CNN reports. "'The last thing we need is to further divide an already divided nation with an array of segregated, separate-but-equal museums for hyphenated identity groups,' Lee said. … The Smithsonian Institution, Lee maintained, 'should not have an exclusive museum of American Latino history or a museum of women's history or museum of American men's history or Mormon history or Asian-American history or Catholic history. American history is an inclusive story that should unite us.' There are museums dedicated to African Americans – the National Museum of African American History and Culture – and Native Americans – the National Museum of the American Indian."

If White House officials thought they could silence criticism of the president's baseless election fraud claims by firing the government's top cybersecurity officials, they were sorely mistaken.
Christopher Krebs reasserted there's no evidence the election was undermined by hacking in a Washington Post op-ed last night and knocked back some of the same phony claims that got him fired by presidential tweet two weeks ago as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
"The 2020 election was the most secure in U.S. history. This success should be celebrated by all Americans, not undermined in the service of a profoundly un-American goal," he wrote.
Krebs will be speaking with David Ignatius in a Washington Post Live event at 11 a.m. today.
Krebs's deputy Matthew Travis, who was ousted at the same time, also slammed the Trump campaign's election fraud claims during an address at the Aspen Institute's Cyber Summit.
"What we were hearing from the Trump campaign was in effect politicizing the security of a sub-sector of infrastructure, namely the election system," he said.
President Trump's fraud claims, meanwhile, are falling flat — both in courtrooms and increasingly among Republicans.
The hardest blow to date came yesterday when Attorney General William P. Barr declared he has "not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election," effectively withdrawing support from Trump's efforts to contest President-elect Joe Biden's victory.
Barr had previously joined Trump in spreading unfounded claims of potential fraud before the election, including the false claim that mail ballots could easily be forged by foreign powers.
The shift reflects the slow but increasingly sure vindication of election officials' hard work to ensure a secure and transparent election process over the president's insistent disinformation campaign.
Trump and his remaining allies, however, are still promoting their baseless claims.
His legal team responded to Barr's statement, saying, "His opinion appears to be without any knowledge or investigation of the substantial irregularities and evidence of systemic fraud."
Current and former officials are also pushing back against threats of violence, including death threats, targeting election officials.
Krebs told NBC's Today Show that he may take legal action against Joe DiGenova, an attorney for Trump's campaign who made violent threats against him during a Monday night TV interview. Among other claims, DiGenova said Krebs should be "drawn and quartered" for defending the integrity of the election.
"It's certainly more dangerous language, more dangerous behavior…I've got an exceptional team of lawyers that win in court and I think they're probably going to be busy," Krebs said.
In his op-ed, Krebs said, "I am not going to be intimidated by these threats from telling the truth to the American people."
During his Aspen speech, Travis called DiGenova "a small man with a small mind and a bad mustache."
Election officials across the country are also facing death threats, many from people who accuse them of being part of wild conspiracies with no basis in reality touted by Trump and his allies.
Gabriel Sterling, an election official in Georgia, where the election process has come under intense attack, gave a passionate speech yesterday denouncing those threats and people who propagate them. "Someone's gonna get shot. Someone's gonna get killed," he warned.
Sterling took Trump on directly.
"Mr. President, you have not condemned this language or these actions…Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence," he said.
"The episode revealed a fissure that has been widening within the Republican Party for weeks as Trump has claimed falsely, again and again, that President-elect Joe Biden won through election fraud," my colleagues Amy Gardner and Keith Newell report.
Here's video from Nicole Carr with Atlanta's ABC affiliate:
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) have defended the integrity of their state's election, which delivered a narrow win to Biden.
A hand audit of all Georgia's approximately 5 million votes and a review of voting machines there found no evidence of fraud or computer hacking. Another audit is scheduled to conclude this week.
Matthew Masterson, CISA's senior cybersecurity adviser, echoed Sterling's warnings on Twitter. "I have heard these same concerns from many election officials. It must stop!" he wrote.
Yet some Republicans are still hedging.
A representative for Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), who's defending his seat in a Jan. 5 runoff, responded to Sterling's plea by saying he "condemns violence of any kind" but "won't apologize for addressing the obvious issues with the way our state conducts its elections."
Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) have both called for Raffensperger to resign, citing "mismanagementand lack of transparency," but they haven't specifically described whathe did wrong.

The keysTrump allies are turning to the Supreme Court in a last-ditch bid to block Biden's win.
Republican allies asked the high court to block a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissing a challenge to the state's mail-in voting system, Robert Barnes and Elise Viebeck report.
They want the state to invalidate more than 2.5 million votes cast by mail. The Pennsylvania court dismissed the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked "due diligence" and waited until after the election to file their complaint.
The Trump campaign also filed a lawsuit to overturn election results in Wisconsin, Rosalind S. Helderman reports. The campaign is seeking to invalidate 220,000 votes there.James Troupis, a lawyer for the campaign, acknowledged it's unlikely the suit will change the election results but said the case would expose "how the election processes were abused in Wisconsin."
The State Department will give cash rewards for tips on North Korea's cyber operations.
They're offering $5 million in rewards for tips about North Korean hacking for profit and other efforts to evade sanctions and fund the rogue nation's nuclear weapons program, Carol Morello reports.
The Treasury Department has accused North Korea of more than $1 billion in hacking thefts.
The United States also plans to inflict greater penalties on Chinese actors that have become key to facilitating Korea's illicit economic operations, Alex Wong, the State Department's deputy envoy for North Korea, said in a virtual speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
The sanctions evading system relies heavily on Chinese middlemen, bank accounts and money launderers, he said. "We've imposed numerous such sanctions designations in the past," Wong said. "And more are forthcoming."
Trump's threatening to veto a national defense spending bill unless Congress takes a whack at social media companies.
He threatened in a set of tweets to veto the annual defense bill unless Congress repeals a federal law granting Internet platforms immunity from legal liability over content posted by users, Tony Romm reports.
Congress has yet to release final National Defense Authorization Act, but versions from both the House and Senate contain dozens of cybersecurity policy recommendations. A veto of the bill would imperil hundreds of millions of dollars for cybersecurity investments.
Trump has aggressively attacked the decades-old law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, for protecting Silicon Valley's alleged bias against conservatives.
National Security WatchNorth Korean hackers are targeting Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine research.
The hackers are also targeting Maryland-basedNovavaxand at least three South Korean companies with Covid-19 drugs in earlier clinical trials in an effort to steal sensitive information they can sell or weaponize, Andrew Jeong reports for the Wall Street Journal.
Reuters previously reported that North Korean hackers were targeting the United Kingdom based coronavirus vaccine maker AstraZeneca.
Global CyberspaceSecurity researchers say 25 countries could be secretly using mobile spyware to intercept calls and track users’ locations.
The countries include Belgium, Mexico, Thailand and Australia, researchers at the digital rights watchdog Citizen Lab say, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai and Joseph Cox at Motherboard report.
They're usingtechnology from a company called Circles that relies on a vulnerability in mobile phone protocols. Advanced versions of the tool allow nations' spy agencies or law enforcement to track users outside their borders.
In 2014 Circles merged with controversial spyware company NSO, which has been associated with governments that spy on human rights activists and dissidents. An NSO representative said both NSO and Circles "lead their industries in a commitment to ethical business and adhere to strict laws and regulations in every market in which they operate."

President Trump upended months of careful, bipartisan negotiations on Tuesday night by threatening to veto a $740 billion bill to fund the military unless Congress includes language to remove liability protections for Facebook, Twitter, Google and other technology companies that have drawn his ire.
In a pair of tweets at 9:45 p.m., Trump demanded the repeal of a 24-year-old federal statute known as Section 230, which has been the legal foundation for free expression on the World Wide Web.
Trump's animus toward tech companies has intensified as search engines and social media giants have taken modest steps to limit the spread of dangerous election disinformation and otherwise challenge his false declarations of victory. On his way out the door, the lame-duck president is desperate to pull the levers of state power to squeeze private enterprises he views as inhospitable to his political interests. That is deeply at odds with the American tradition. It also would have been anathema to conservatives before Trump hijacked their movement.
The White House did not respond to a request for an explanation of why a 1996 amendment to a 1934 communications law represents "a serious threat to our National Security." There is no evidence that it does. Section 230 has no meaningful nexus with national security.
Over the past four years, Trump has repeatedly stretched the meaning of "National Security." He always treats it as a proper noun.
He has invoked the term to justify nativism on immigration, from imposing the travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries to diverting money from the military budget for his border wall and excluding the state of New York from a trusted traveler program.
He has cited national security to defend rolling back environmental protections to allow more coal mining and to offer government support for oil companies.
He has trotted out the "National Security" excuse to justify imposing tariffs on stalwart allies. Even Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called that rationale "insulting and unacceptable."
When Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor anonymously wrote a critical op-ed for the New York Times in 2018, Trump suggested that their source was phony. "If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist," he tweeted, "the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!"
He has claimed that former national security adviser John Bolton's book endangered "National Security." In October, the president tweeted that "Joe Biden is a National Security threat!" In 2017, Trump tweeted that his former opponent Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server "endangered National Security." He did not feel the same way when his daughter was caught conducting government business on her own private email account.
Ironically, on Feb. 18, a few months before he tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, Trump decried efforts on Capitol Hill to limit what products businesses can sell to China by complaining about the "always used National Security excuse."
Trump already threatened last month to veto the National Defense Authorization Act if it retains a provision requiring the Pentagon to change the names of 10 military installations that honor racist Confederate officers who took up arms against the United States to preserve the institution of slavery. Trump has massively resisted this change.
"Some Republicans in recent days have suggested a trade: Reforming Section 230 in exchange for the base-name changes that Democrats seek. Democrats largely have balked at the idea," Tony Romm explains. "Many lawmakers — Democrats and Republicans — increasingly have come to question whether the protections are outdated, conferring legal immunity on tech giants at a time when they have failed to crack down on hate speech, election disinformation and other harmful content online. But Trump and his Republican allies have seized on the debate to advance their arguments that Facebook, Google, Twitter and others should be penalized for exhibiting systemic political bias against conservatives — a charge for which they have provided scant evidence, and one that tech giants long have denied."
A handful of Republicans are speaking out against Trump's threat to derail funding for the troops. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) tweeted this morning that "230 should NOT be mixed with NDAA & used by @realDonaldTrump to veto."
This would be Trump's ninth veto as president. An NDAA has passed for 59 consecutive years. In October 2015, President Barack Obama initially vetoed the bill because of the way it would have sidestepped budget limitations for the military and because it would restrict the transfer of detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay. A few weeks later, after Congress passed an updated version that addressed some of his concerns, Obama signed the measure into law.
Here is what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had to say at the time:
The voting warsA Republican election official in Georgia accuses Trump of fostering violent threats.
"Gabriel Sterling, a voting systems manager for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, was visibly angry and shaken as he approached a lectern in the Georgia Capitol," Amy Gardner and Keith Newell report. "'Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language,' he said. 'Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. … Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.' … Sterling's public chastisement represents one of the strongest rebukes yet of Trump's baseless attacks on the election's integrity by a member of his own party. … Sterling also demanded that the two senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, denounce the threats that flowed into his office after Trump began attacking Raffensperger for failing to repeat his false accusations of fraud." Trump responded to a video of Sterling's speech by reiterating the false conspiracy theories that have fueled the threats.
In related news: When five patients died of the coronavirus in a 32-hour span at a hospital in Reno, Nev., physician Jacob Keeperman turned to Twitter to thank colleagues for all their support, tweeting a selfie of him on the day the alternate care site opened. His message took on a different meaning Tuesday evening, though, when Trump retweeted a conservative lifestyle blog that falsely claimed the selfie in front of empty hospital beds proved that the pandemic was a hoax. Keeperman said he was saddened that the president shared the disinformation. "It was turned into something that it was never meant to be," he said. (Andrea Salcedo)

"Trump fired me for saying this, but I'll say it again: The election wasn't rigged," Chris Krebs wrote an op-ed for our newspaper.
A group of 25 former presidents of the D.C. Bar said lawyers shouldn't be complicit in Trump's attacks on democracy.In an op-ed, they write that "no lawyer may seek, on behalf of any client, to subvert democratic institutions or burden the courts with claims that the lawyer knows are frivolous."
Attorney General Bill Barr says he hasn’t seen fraud that could affect the election’s outcome.
"Barr said Tuesday that he has 'not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,' undercutting claims that President Trump and his allies have made — without evidence — of widespread and significant voting irregularities," Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett and Josh Dawsey report. "His comments to the Associated Press, while caveated, make Barr the highest-ranking Trump administration official to break with the president on his allegation that the election was stolen. … Barr said the FBI and the Justice Department had looked into some fraud claims. … [Rudy Giuliani] and Jenna Ellis, a legal adviser to the campaign, said, 'With all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn't been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation.' …
"At the same time Barr's comments became public Tuesday, the Justice Department revealed that the attorney general had, in October, secretly appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham of Connecticut as special counsel examining how the FBI investigated the Trump campaign in 2016 and beyond — a move that might hearten Trump and his allies. … The order to install him as special counsel is likely to ensure that his work is not shut down by the incoming administration … Under Justice Department regulations, special counsels can be dismissed only for misconduct or some other good cause, making it more difficult for the next attorney general to end Durham's investigation. [This was cheered by Republicans and decried by Democrats.] …
"A person who spoke with Trump on Monday said he was railing against governors in Republican states — particularly in Georgia and Arizona — who would not back up his claims of fraud and were proceeding to certify election results. … Trump nevertheless is unlikely to give it up until at least after the electoral college votes Dec. 14, this person said. An administration official … told The Post that in recent months, Barr and Trump have 'barely spoken,' though they did have a conversation the week before Thanksgiving. … Trump has complained to advisers about his attorney general, two officials said, and the frustration has filtered to Barr even as the men have talked less frequently. The president has also been annoyed that Barr has expressed support for FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, whose public statements contradicting Trump — about election security and domestic extremism — have made him a frequent target of the president's rage."
Every losing candidate since 1896 has offered a concession. Trump could break that mold.
That's "when defeated Nebraska lawyer William Jennings Bryan sent a conciliatory telegram to Ohio Gov. William McKinley, who won the election to succeed Grover Cleveland," Bonnie Berkowitz reports. Inauguration Day often begins with a pre-inauguration meal at the White House that is supposed to be cordial and noncontroversial. It isn't always. In 1953, following a spat over a missed meeting, Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower didn't show up to the customary lunch that Bess Truman prepared. Inauguration Day also usually features a show of unity in a ride to the Capitol. The tradition began in 1837, when Martin Van Buren and Andrew Jackson shared a carriage. So far, only President-elect Ulysses Grant has refused to share a ride, prompting his predecessor, Andrew Johnson, to skip his inauguration, making Johnson the third and last president to date to refuse to see his successor sworn in. Both John Adams and John Quincy Adams left Washington early to avoid the celebrations. Inauguration day ends with the swearing-in. Each departing president since Ronald Reagan has left a handwritten note for his successor in the Oval Office. We'll see if Trump does the same for the man who made him a one-term president.
Trump is considering kicking off his 2024 campaign on Inauguration Day. "There is 'preliminary planning' underway for a Jan. 20 event to kick off a new Trump bid, the people familiar with the discussions said, though it's possible the president could make the announcement earlier as no final decisions have been made," NBC News reports. "Regardless of the timing of a campaign announcement, Trump is not expected to attend the inauguration … He also does not plan to invite Biden to the White House or even call him."
Trump considers granting pre-emptive pardons to his children and son-in-law.
"Mr. Trump has told others that he is concerned that a Biden Justice Department might seek retribution against the president by targeting the oldest three of his five children — Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump — as well as Ms. Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, a White House senior adviser," the New York Times reports. "The nature of Mr. Trump's concern about any potential criminal exposure of Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump is unclear, although an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney into the Trump Organization has expanded to include tax write-offs on millions of dollars in consulting fees by the company, some of which appear to have gone to Ms. Trump. Presidential pardons, however, do not provide protection against state or local crimes."
"The Justice Department in August investigated a potential 'bribery-for-pardon' scheme in which a large political contribution would be offered in exchange for a presidential pardon by the White House, according to court records unsealed Tuesday," Spencer Hsu reports.
A lawyer for Trump and three of his adult children argued before the 2nd Circuit that a fraud case brought against them for endorsing ACN — a marketing organization selling telecommunications products — should be sent to arbitration and not go forward in open court. Four plaintiffs say they were duped into paying to join ACN as independent sales representatives because the Trumps presented it as a promising business opportunity on "The Apprentice." A district court judge ruled against the Trumps. (Shayna Jacobs)
The coronavirusSeveral new coronavirus relief proposals emerge on Capitol Hill.
In addition to a compromise proposal from several centrist senators, House Democrats and McConnell circulated new offers. "The growing calls for action have not led to a unified approach," Seung Min Kim, Jeff Stein and Mike DeBonis report. "Still, the new actions and statements Tuesday may reflect movement toward some level of pandemic relief … McConnell disclosed Tuesday that senior Republicans received a new coronavirus relief offer from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Monday night. Democratic aides declined to disclose details of their offer, and Schumer called it a 'private proposal to help us move the ball forward.'
"Senate Republican leaders circulated a slimmed-down plan Tuesday that would probably be fiercely opposed by Democrats. The measure includes a liability shield for businesses and more small-business assistance. It would provide short-term, limited jobless aid but no additional funding for state and local governments or help for cash-strapped transit agencies. … The McConnell bill also reintroduces a Republican plan to allow diners to claim a tax deduction on their meal expenditures, a provision pushed by the business lobby but viewed skeptically by economists and some Republicans. …
"Some lawmakers have hoped that elements of a bipartisan stimulus deal could be added to the spending bill required to avoid a Dec. 11 government shutdown, although that could complicate the must-pass legislation. Nonetheless, McConnell suggested Tuesday that the spending bill could be an avenue to pass targeted coronavirus relief. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke Tuesday afternoon about the government funding bill. As for the bipartisan Senate framework, Mnuchin said he would review it, although the plan got a much icier reaction from the White House."
Against the backdrop of federal inaction, states are racing to craft their own economic relief plans. "Michigan, for example, has sought to extend another round of enhanced payments to its unemployed residents. Minnesota has eyed one-time stimulus checks to locals under financial duress. And Colorado has mounted a wide-ranging effort to help its cash-starved workers and businesses, working on legislative proposals that could help cover rent payments, utility bills and other critical costs," Romm reports.
As President-elect Biden introduced his economic brain trust in Wilmington, Del., his pick for Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, urged a swift and ambitious response."Biden's choice of economic advisers highlights a commitment to spend whatever is needed to restore a full-employment economy, setting up a clash with Senate Republicans who are sounding alarms over a national debt they helped Trump increase by nearly $7 trillion," David Lynch reports.

New York's MTA is preparing to cut subway service by 40 percent while it considers a $3 billion loan from the Federal Reserve. Boston is proposing to shorten hours of operation. The D.C.

Britain beats U.S. in granting the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine emergency authorization.
"Britain became the first country to grant emergency approval … to the coronavirus vaccine developed by the Pfizer and BioNTech, smashing all speed records to see a potentially lifesaving shot invented, tested and approved in less than a year.," William Booth and Karla Adam report. "British officials said a mass immunization program would begin almost immediately, with distribution of the first 800,000 doses to begin next week. … Drug regulators in Britain have a global reputation for being tough but fast, and [the] decision is likely to intensify the focus on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has faced increasing pressure from the Trump administration to approve Pfizer's vaccine."
Who will get the first doses on this side of the pond?
A federal advisory panel recommended last night that the initial inoculations should be given to an estimated 21 million health-care workers and 3 million residents and staff of nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities. "These groups were deemed the highest priority by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, because the vaccine will initially be in extremely short supply after it is cleared by federal regulators," Lena Sun and Isaac Stanley-Becker report."Residents and employees of long-term-care facilities were prioritized because they account for nearly 40 percent of deaths from covid-19 … The recommendations for the highest-priority groups, known as Phase 1a, will be sent to CDC Director Robert Redfield, who also informs Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. If the recommendations are approved, they will become official CDC recommendations on immunization in the United States and provide guidance to state officials, who are scrambling to meet a Friday deadline for vaccine distribution planning.
"The committee voted 13 to 1 to prioritize the two groups. Helen Keipp Talbot, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University, was the sole dissenting vote. Unease over the recommendations centered on the inclusion of long-term-care residents, with several panel members saying there was insufficient vaccine safety and efficacy data to support immunizing them right away. … What the committee will probably recommend may differ from what some Trump administration officials want, according to three federal health officials."
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be transported and stored at minus-94 degrees, jump-starting the race for special freezers. "Ford has announced it is acquiring its own ultracold freezers to supply employees with Pfizer's vaccine. Hospital systems, logistics and delivery companies are also gearing up," Stefano Pitrelli reports.
"Investigators at the Department of Homeland Security are bracing for a new wave of fraud attempts by criminal groups that officials expect will try to take advantage of the extraordinary demand for doses," Nick Miroff reports.

Nearly 100,000 covid patients are hospitalized in U.S., and 181,769 new cases were reported yesterday.
"An influx of new covid-19 patients could lead to hard decisions in the worst-hit hospitals about how to allocate medical resources and care," Ariana Eunjung Cha, Lenny Bernstein, Sun and Jose Del Real report."Tom Moore, an infectious-disease doctor in Wichita, said cases had been rising steadily throughout the summer because of outbreaks at meatpacking plants. But over the past few days, the number of positive cases has reached shocking levels. … Moore described a nurse in the intensive care unit breaking down crying … Sixteen states and Puerto Rico reported record numbers of hospitalizations on Tuesday, and four states tied with their highest days. Arizona, California, Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and West Virginia each reported more than a 25 percent increase in the average number of hospitalizations compared with one week ago." Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) moved to increase hospital staff capacity. The state has 1,583 people in hospitals being treated for the virus, the most since early May.
Revised CDC guidance says 2-week coronavirus quarantines can be cut to 10 or 7 days.
"The move reflects the agency's recognition that the two-week quarantine rule is onerous for many people and that most of the public health benefit from quarantining people exposed to the virus can be gained with a more flexible approach," Joel Achenbach reports. "The CDC acknowledges that this new guidance involves a trade-off. The existing 14-day quarantine recommendation reflects the ability of the virus to incubate for a long period of time before symptoms appear. But lack of compliance — for example, among people who fear that they will lose a job, or two weeks of income, if they admit to being exposed — can undermine the public health benefit from that standard."
Health officials learned several lessons from last week.
"Americans heard the pleas to stay home. They were told what would happen if they didn't. Still, millions traveled and gathered during last week's Thanksgiving holiday," William Wan and Brittany Shammas report. "Health experts point to several key takeaways: Many states were overwhelmed by unexpected surges in testing — with many families hoping a negative result might make their planned gatherings a little safer. Some airports were not prepared for the huge crowds that had not been seen since the beginning of the pandemic, making it difficult for travelers to maintain social distancing. But perhaps the most obvious lesson: Public health messaging needs to be retooled, as whole swaths of the country are simply tuning out the warnings from officials and experts."

"The stakes are high for Zalaunshae Pearson and her classmates at Achievement Prep public charter school's elementary campus in Southeast Washington," Perry Stein reports. "In March, around 90 percent of the school's first-graders hit their reading targets, according to internal assessments. Then when the pandemic hit and schools abruptly closed, teachers sent the children home with academic packets. The school remained closed, and the packets kept coming. The first-graders became second-graders. The 6-year-olds became 7-year-olds. This fall, individual reading assessments administered in person highlighted the cost of trying to learn during the pandemic. All 45 second-graders fell behind. Not a single student started the academic year reading on grade level. It was far worse than a typical summer learning drop. Some were reading at an early first-grade level, others at a kindergarten level. …
"The 183 students in kindergarten through third grade at Achievement Prep are among the children that education leaders fear will fare the worst from prolonged school closures. Ninety-seven percent are Black. Nearly 70 percent are from families that qualify for public assistance. Thirteen percent are homeless. The students already fell on the wrong side of the achievement gap."
While the Americans mostly kept classrooms closed but bars open, Europe kept their schools open despite a second wave. And it's been relatively safe:"As long as they adhered to a now-established set of precautions — mask-wearing, hand-washing, ventilation — schools are thought to have played only a limited role in accelerating coronavirus transmission in Europe," Michael Birnbaum reports. "Those conclusions contrast sharply with the prevailing wisdom in the United States, where public health officials have focused on low rates of positive coronavirus tests in the broader community as a prerequisite for in-person schooling."

Race and reckoningSeven civil rights groups want Biden to appoint more Black officials to top roles.
"Biden has rolled out a diverse set of appointments but reserved the initial marquee slots in the Cabinet and White House for White candidates, prompting worry that Biden is failing to make good on his promises to promote Black leaders to prominent jobs," Annie Linskey and Matt Viser report. "Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, said Tuesday that he was baffled that Biden has failed to confirm a meeting with the civil rights groups nearly a month after Election Day. … Prominent advocates, and members of Congress who typically keep a lower profile, also expressed disappointment in the fledgling Biden administration — in some cases saying they hoped that sounding the alarm would influence Biden's thinking as he fills out his government. 'I really thought — at this stage of the game — I would see more African American appointments in the top positions,' said Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) … Clayola Brown, president of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, a Black trade union group, said Biden had 'fallen a bit more than just short' of expectations with regard to appointing Black officials."
The Black Lives Matter movement is at a crossroads. "Some factions of the Black Lives Matter movement — which spread globally with decentralized leadership and multifaceted goals — worry that Biden embodies the cautious brand of moderate, Washington-centric politics they loathe," Tim Craig and Robert Klemko report. "Justin Hansford, who was an activist in Ferguson, Mo., after the police killing of Michael Brown in 2014, said the election presents an opportunity for Biden and activists to work together. But Hansford, now the executive director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard University, said the 'biggest mistake' Biden could make would be to assume that he can appease today's generation of activists by repackaging the reform proposals that circulated during the final months of Obama's second term. While activists were then calling for the 'demilitarization of the police,' Hansford said, today's generation will settle for nothing less than 'reimagining the police.' … Organizers for more than 30 Black Lives Matter chapters — including Nashville, Memphis, Indianapolis, Chicago and Philadelphia — have formed a discussion group to consider their own sets of demands from a Biden administration."
Obama, in an interview with Snapchat, said "snappy" slogans such as "defund the police" alienate people."You lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you're actually going to get the changes you want done," the former president said. "The key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?" (Axios)

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
In 2016, for the first time since America ratified the 17th Amendment in 1913 and began directly electing senators, whichever party carried a state in the presidential race also won the Senate contest there. Politics has been growing increasingly nationalized for decades, but President Trump supercharged these trends and accelerated a once-in-a-generation realignment. Sen. Doug Jones is almost certain to lose because he is a Democrat in Alabama while Sen. Susan Collins trails in the polls because she is a Republican in Maine, and many GOP strategists have written off Sen. Cory Gardner because he is a Republican in Colorado.
In other words, whether Republicans maintain Senate control is inextricably linked to how Trump fares 13 days from now. A fresh Washington Post-ABC News poll from North Carolina illustrates this: Republican Sen. Thom Tillis and Democrat Cal Cunningham are locked in a toss-up race. Revelations of illicit texts and an extramarital affair with a political consultant do not appear to have meaningfully hurt Cunningham because voters say they care more about which party controls the Senate and the incumbent's support for Trump than the challenger's moral character.
Cunningham's 49 percent support among likely voters is identical to that of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. In our poll, 92 percent of Biden supporters back Cunningham and 92 percent of Trump supporters back Tillis. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats and Republicans in the Tar Heel State say that control of the Senate is "extremely" or "very" important in their vote.
There is less ticket-splitting now than in any era since Reconstruction. Collins, a moderate Republican, won reelection six years ago with 69 percent of the vote, two years after Barack Obama garnered 56 percent in Maine. But then Trump came down the golden escalator, and she cast a pivotal vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court after Christine Blasey Ford's testimony that the judge sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers. Kavanaugh vigorously denied this.
Many prominent Republicans have privately become more pessimistic about their hopes of holding the Senate in two weeks because Trump is currently faring worse than they had expected in states with competitive Senate races, from Arizona to Iowa and Georgia. It is also why GOP strategists are feeling confident that competitive races will break their way in red states that Trump is poised to carry, including Montana, South Carolina, Kansas, Alaska and Texas, even as Democrats wage well-funded campaigns.
On the other hand, Democrats feel hopeful that Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) will survive what polls show is a toss-up race with GOP challenger John James so long as Biden wins Michigan. But Democratic strategists say that Peters, who is not well known and has run a lackluster campaign, will probably lose reelection if Trump finds a way to pull out a repeat victory in the Wolverine State.
Republicans hold a 53-to-47 seat majority. Democrats need to pick up a net four seats to seize control of the upper chamber. If Biden wins, they need to gain three because a Vice President Kamala Harris could cast a tie-breaking vote.
Historically, with the political atmosphere the way it is, it would be expected that GOP incumbents would be trying to distance themselves from Trump. But most Republican senators in tough races have been nervous to publicly break with the president because they recognize how closely their fortunes are tied together. They are fearful of being on the receiving end of the kind of Trump tweetstorm that greeted Collins last week over her opposition to confirming Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.
Strikingly, Trump has devoted more tweets recently to attacking Republican senators who crossed him, such as Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.), than their Democratic challengers. This is consistent with the president's long-held belief that it is better to be feared than loved. It has been central to his governing style, and it has more often than not worked for him vis-a-vis Capitol Hill.
The fact that more Senate Republicans have not distanced themselves from Trump helps explain why the president is so convinced that he could prod them to vote for a coronavirus relief deal and stomach whatever concerns they might have about a $2 trillion package still being negotiated with Democrats by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
"Prospects for an economic relief package in the next two weeks dimmed markedly on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) revealed that he has warned the White House not to strike an agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi before the Nov. 3 election," Jeff Stein and Erica Werner report. "Republicans have voiced concerns that a stimulus deal could splinter the party and exacerbate divisions at a time when they are trying to rally behind the Supreme Court nominee. … Trump has in recent days downplayed or dismissed conservative opposition to spending trillions more on a stimulus, saying he wants to spend even more money than Pelosi's latest $2.2 trillion proposal. Many Republicans had already balked at spending more than $1 trillion on this round of relief."
But Trump was dismissive when he was asked Tuesday about McConnell's resistance to calling a vote on a package so big. "He'll be onboard if something comes," the president said on Fox News. "Not every Republican agrees with me, but they will."
The coronavirusUnprecedented vaccine trials are on track to begin delivering results.
"In a matter of weeks, one of the most closely watched human experiments in history will start to report early results, with data on prospective coronavirus vaccines possibly coming this month or in November from the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the biotechnology company Moderna," Carolyn Johnson reports. "Amid the turmoil, chaos and misinformation that have defined the U.S. response to the pandemic, progress toward a vaccine, or vaccines, has been steady, reassuring and scientific. Political meddling has so far been largely deflected. Drug companies, working closely with the U.S. government and fueled by an infusion of more than $10 billion of taxpayer money, have developed, tested and scaled up a half-dozen potential vaccines at unprecedented speed. And on Thursday, independent advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will convene their first full-day meeting to lay the groundwork for their coming consequential deliberations on whether to recommend specific vaccines for public use. Those votes are not binding, but the FDA typically follows the recommendations of its advisory committees."

The pandemic has left 299,000 more people dead in the U.S. than would be expected in a typical year.
The CDC says two-thirds of them are from covid-19 and the rest are from other causes. New federal data show the virus has taken a disproportionate toll on Latinos and Blacks, as we've written about extensively, but researchers also found, more surprisingly, that the contagion has struck 25- to 44-year-olds very hard. "Their 'excess death' rate is up 26.5  percent over previous years, the largest change for any age group. It is not clear whether that spike is caused by the shift in covid-19 deaths toward younger people between May and August or deaths from other causes," Lenny Bernstein reports."The United States is in the midst of another sharp increase in coronavirus infections, this one centered in the upper Midwest and Plains states. The seven-day rolling average of cases, considered the most accurate barometer, is near 60,000 per day. At least 220,000 people have died of covid-19 so far … (Experts say) the total is likely to reach 400,000 by the end of the year."
The opioid crisis is getting worse, but drug overdoses are overshadowed by the pandemic.
"After a one-year drop in 2018, U.S. opioid overdose deaths increased again in 2019, topping 50,000 for the first time," the AP reports, citing CDC data. "That accounted for the majority of the 71,000 fatal overdoses from all drugs. … Ohio, a battleground state in the presidential contest, is on track to have one of its deadliest years of opioid drug overdoses. More residents died of overdoses in May than in any month in at least 14 years … During Trump's first two years in office, 48 of the 59 Ohio counties with reliable data saw their overdose death rates get worse …
"What that looks like on the ground is mothers donating to GoFundMe accounts and Facebook campaigns so other mothers can bury their children who've overdosed. Some parents even reserve a casket while their child is still alive so they are prepared for what they believe is inevitable. Others become legal guardians of their grandchildren."
DHS, which led the way in past health crises, has been far less visible.
"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has a history of helping to lead the U.S. response to public-health threats such as swine flu and Ebola, standing with the nation's top medical experts to emphasize that the threat to the nation is severe. But during the months-long coronavirus pandemic that has affected much of American society, one of the country's largest federal agencies has instead publicly promoted immigrants, anarchists and smugglers as more dangerous to the United States than a virus," Maria Sacchetti reports. Acting Secretary Chad Wolf rarely mentions the coronavirus on Twitter. He and his deputies routinely peel off their masks during public events to speak to indoor audiences. "I don't know what role, if any, DHS is playing," said Janet Napolitano, President Barack Obama's first DHS secretary and a former governor of Arizona. "They're kind of MIA."

Quote of the day
"Before the plague came in, I had it made," Trump said Tuesday at a rally in Erie, Pa., referring to the coronavirus. "I wasn't coming to Erie. I have to be honest. There was no way I was coming. I didn't have to."

The electionBiden's campaign has three times as much cash on hand as Trump's.
"Biden's campaign committee entered October with an estimated $180 million compared with Trump's $63 million, according to federal filings made public Tuesday night — a dramatic reversal in financial resources that unfolded in recent months as Democratic donors in September poured a record amount of money into supporting Biden," Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy report. "An increasing number of donors have met the maximum amount they can contribute to the Trump campaign, and the campaign in recent months has maintained a virtual fundraising schedule that has been less aggressive than Biden's. … At least 31.4million people nationwide have already voted in the general election, with at least 15.8million of those in battleground states … The Biden campaign recently told its donors that it is projecting to raise $234million more before Election Day, but it urged supporters not to take the fundraising for granted."
Tensions run high at early-voting sites.
"The first days of early voting have unfolded with dozens of accusations of inappropriate campaigning and possible voter intimidation in at least 14 states," Joshua Partlow reports. "At one polling place at a church in Hendersonville, Tenn., last week, a Trump supporter drove by repeatedly in a large truck-and-trailer rig with Trump flags and music blaring from speakers, 'creating a lot of havoc,' said Lori Ashley, the administrator of elections for Sumner County. … In Albuquerque, a convoy of vehicles, some with Trump flags, honked and yelled near a voting site on Saturday, the first day of early voting, according to a video submitted to news station KRQE. … Inside a polling place in the Coral Ridge Mall in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a group of people not wearing masks got into a shouting match Monday with others nearby, according to Stephanie Lillo, 30, a voter who witnessed the disturbance."
"Authorities in Florida and Alaska on Tuesday were investigating threatening emails sent to Democratic voters that claimed to be from the Proud Boys, a far-right group supportive of Trump, but appeared instead to be a deceptive campaign making use of a vulnerability in the organization's online network," Isaac Stanley-Becker and Craig Timberg report.

After the 2016 election, our opinion desk asked readers to share why they voted for Trump.
They checked back in with voters whose responses they published four years ago to find out whether the president could count on their support again. Here is what they had to say: "In 2016 … I held my nose and voted for Donald Trump. This time, I won't be holding my nose," said Jay Maynard, 60, of Fairmont, Minn. "However much or little you ascribe blame for the current restlessness of the country to Trump, he's definitely not the solution," said Max Mordell, 34, of Cincinnati. "It's easy to say, 'I'm a conservative,' and vote that way when the person I supported was humble and thoughtful. … These times are not those," said Lesley Newman, 57, of Scottsdale, Ariz.
"All of the mindless chatter about his tweets and political incorrectness is childish and ridiculous," said Phil McNeish, 61, of Roanoke, Va. "I'm still glad the Clintons are not in the White House, but I will be voting for Biden in November," said Howard Gaskill, 80, of Georgetown, Del. "They have not given me any reason to vote for Biden except that Trump is bad. And that's not enough," said Shoanna Crowell, 49, of Boston.
Angry at Lesley Stahl, Trump threatened to preemptively release their interview.
"Trump lashed out at '60 Minutes' host Lesley Stahl and threatened to release their interview after he cut off their conversation at the White House on Tuesday because he didn't like the aggressive tone of her questions," Josh Dawsey, Colby Itkowitz and Jeremy Barr report."The president posted a short clip of a maskless Stahl speaking to two mask-wearing men and wrote, 'Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes not wearing a mask in the White House after her interview with me. Much more to come.' A little more than an hour later, Trump threatened to post their interview before the news program is scheduled to air it Sunday night on CBS News. … Trump and Pence were meant to do the signature walk-and-talk portion of the '60Minutes' interview together, but after cutting off his sit-down with Stahl, the president did not return for that segment. A person at CBS familiar with the interview said the footage of Stahl without a mask that Trump tweeted was taken 'immediately following the interview with the CBS team,' all of whom had been tested …
"According to a person with knowledge of what happened during the interview, Trump was unhappy that Stahl asked him tough questions regarding his rhetoric about Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the size of the crowds at his rallies and his disputes with Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading infectious-disease expert. Stahl also told him during the interview that allegations about Biden's son Hunter were not verified and that the Obama administration did not spy on the Trump campaign. Many of the questions were about the coronavirus pandemic and his handling of it … Three aides, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said the president overreacted, and one suggested that he might actually boost the ratings of a tough interview. A senior White House official said Trump had told aides he wanted to go after Stahl and brainstormed ideas after the session with a group of aides in the Oval Office."
Trump and Biden are preparing very differently for their final debate.
"Biden is keeping an unusually light public schedule. In the past four days, he has traveled outside his home state of Delaware just once, to North Carolina on Sunday," " Amy Wang, Sean Sullivan and Dawsey report. "Biden's surrogates have kept a robust travel schedule in his place: Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), his running mate, campaigned in Florida on Monday, and [Obama] is scheduled to hold his first public event for Biden in Philadelphia on Wednesday. … Trump has not undertaken the same kind of formal preparation as before the first debate …
"Trump wants and plans to bring up Hunter Biden during the debate, though some of his advisers would prefer that he focus on the economy and Joe Biden's record … Biden's advisers, for their part, see little to be gained by engaging publicly in the details of Hunter Biden's alleged emails and texts beyond what they have already said … But ignoring the matter altogether is not an option either, … leaving some uncertainty about how Biden will address it Thursday night."
The FBI notified Congress last night that it has "nothing to add at this time" to a statement made by Trump's director of national intelligence disputing the idea that Russia orchestrated the discovery of a computer that may have belonged to Hunter Biden. "FBI Assistant Director Jill C. Tyson sent the letter to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), a Trump ally and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, in response to his demand for more information about the computer following a series of reports by the New York Post," Devlin Barrett reports."Appearing Monday on Fox Business Channel, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said 'there is no intelligence that supports' the idea that the purported Hunter Biden laptop and the emails on it 'are part of a Russian disinformation campaign.' The letter notes that the FBI faced a severe backlash for its handling of the 2016 investigations surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and makes clear it is seeking to avoid the kind of criticism heaped upon it by the Justice Department's inspector general, among others, for the FBI's decision to notify Congress less than two weeks before Election Day that it had reopened an investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server."
Swing states that may decide the election are vulnerable to USPS slowdowns.
"Consistent and timely delivery remains scattershot as the agency struggles to right operations after the rollout, then suspension, of a major midsummer restructuring. In 17 postal districts representing 10 battleground states and 151 electoral votes, first-class mail is on time 83.9 percent; that's 7.8 percentage points lower than January and nearly 2 percentage points below the national average. By that measure, more than 1 in 6 mailings arrive outside the agency's one- to three-day delivery window," Jacob Bogage and Christopher Ingraham report. "The slowdowns, which have raised alarms and suspicions among voters, postal workers and voting experts, have particular implications for states with strict voter deadlines. Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, for example, do not accept ballots that arrive after Election Day regardless of postmark. Of the states that do, there is generally a short qualifying window: In North Carolina, where polls have Trump and Biden in a dead heat, postmarked ballots must arrive within three days of the election. …
"In Detroit, where Democrats are relying on heavy turnout to carry the rest of Michigan, only 70.9 percent of first-class mail was on time the week that ended Oct. 9, compared with 92.2 percent at the start of the year. In Wisconsin — which struggled mightily with a vote-by-mail primary in August — on-time delivery fell to 84.3 percent in the Lakeland district, which encompasses most of the state. … Timeliness also varied widely in postal districts in Pennsylvania and Florida. … Some postal workers say ballot-handling directives from higher-ups have been chaotic. Letter carriers in Michigan say supervisors press them to focus on package delivery toward the end of their shifts, leaving ballot collection lower on the priority list. In Pennsylvania, clerks are preparing to handstamp ballot envelopes in the final stretch of the 2020 campaign, to steer them away from overwhelmed processing plants."
The Trump presidencyMore than 500 children have lost their parents because of Trump's family-separation policy.
"Lawyers appointed by a federal judge to identify migrant families who were separated by the Trump administration say that they have yet to track down the parents of 545 children and that about two-thirds of those parents were deported to Central America without their children, according to a filing Tuesday from the American Civil Liberties Union," NBC News reports. "The Trump administration instituted a 'zero tolerance' policy in 2018 that separated migrant children and parents at the southern U.S. border. The administration later confirmed that it had actually begun separating families in 2017 along some parts of the border under a pilot program."
Trump paid more in taxes to the Chinese government than income tax in the United States.
"Trump and his allies have tried to paint [Biden] as soft on China, in part by pointing to his son's business dealings there," the New York Times reports. "But Mr. Trump's own business history is filled with overseas financial deals, and some have involved the Chinese state. He spent a decade unsuccessfully pursuing projects in China, operating an office there during his first run for president and forging a partnership with a major government-controlled company. And it turns out that China is one of only three foreign nations — the others are Britain and Ireland — where Mr. Trump maintains a bank account … The foreign accounts do not show up on Mr. Trump's public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names. … The Chinese account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management L.L.C., which the tax records show paid $188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015. … Until last year, China's biggest state-controlled bank rented three floors in Trump Tower, a lucrative lease that drew accusations of a conflict of interest for the president."
Trump's lawyers continue to delay complying with a congressional subpoena for the tax returns. "Douglas Letter, general counsel for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said Trump 'has refused to cooperate at all, unlike all of the modern prior presidents. That is why we are here.' He urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to act before the start of a new Congress in January to enforce the subpoena for the president's records," Ann Marimow reports.
A major Trump fundraiser pleads guilty to acting as an unregistered foreign agent for China.
"Elliott Broidy pleaded guilty Tuesday to acting as an unregistered foreign agent, admitting to accepting millions of dollars to secretly lobby the Trump administration for Malaysian and Chinese interests," Spencer Hsu reports. "In a plea deal, Broidy, who helped raise millions for President Trump's campaign before serving as the Republican National Committee's national deputy finance chair, agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a recommendation of leniency at sentencing and to forfeit $6.6 million. Justice Department officials called Broidy and his co-conspirators' secret work on behalf of the ringleader of a Malaysian government scandal and a Chinese security official a case study of foreign governments' efforts to influence U.S. policy while hiding behind politically influential proxies. … Broidy acknowledged working for the benefit of a senior Chinese security minister to return outspoken Chinese exile Guo Wengui to his home country from the United States, prosecutors said."
Senior government officials are suspect of Trump's motives in pushing to fast-track a 5G contract.
"Senior officials throughout various departments and agencies of the Trump administration tell CNN they are alarmed at White House pressure to grant what would essentially be a no-bid contract to lease the Department of Defense's mid-band spectrum – premium real estate for the booming and lucrative 5G market – to Rivada Networks, a company in which prominent Republicans and supporters of Trump have investments," Jake Tapper reports. "The pressure campaign to fast track Rivada's 'Request for Proposal' by using authorities that would preclude a competitive bidding process intensified in September, and has been led by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who was acting at Trump's behest … Trump was encouraged to help Rivada by Fox News commentator and veteran GOP strategist Karl Rove, a lobbyist for, and investor in, Rivada. Untold billions are at stake. A government auction of 70 megahertz of spectrum in August went for more than $4.5 billion. The Rivada bid would be for 350 megahertz of spectrum -- five times that amount. … Rove denied to CNN that Rivada is seeking an RFP or any non-competitive process. …
"Denials notwithstanding, informed sources (say) that the White House is unquestionably pressuring the Pentagon to approve what would likely be, in the words of one senior administration official, 'the biggest handoff of economic power to a single entity in history,' and to do so without full examination of the impact on national security and without a competitive bidding process. Craig Moffett, a highly regarded Wall Street analyst of the telecommunications sector, concluded in a October 7 research paper: 'The whole story smacks of cronyism at best and reeks of 'the swamp' at worst.' …
"Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has been arguing against anything but free market competition … For years, Trump seemingly agreed with Kudlow. Yet something changed come election time … and the President began pushing Meadows to help Rivada. Informed sources speculate that Trump may have been trying to curry favor with Rove, who has never been a reliable member of the MAGA team but remains a powerful fundraising force and strategist in GOP politics. … FCC officials have also been stunned at the White House's push, both at its attempt to do this using other agencies instead of their independent commission, and the attempt to do so without respecting the normal independent bidding process."
Trump’s DOJ sued Google, but it’s the government’s power to police big tech that will be on trial.
"The Justice Department on Tuesday alleged that Google engaged in unlawful, anticompetitive tactics to grow its search and advertising empires into dominant digital forces, enriching itself and amassing unrivaled market share that makes it impossible for smaller companies to compete and thrive," Tony Romm reports. "At stake is no less than Washington's power and political willingness to watch over Silicon Valley, so the government's gambit against Google stands to test whether roughly century-old antitrust rules are sufficiently powerful to keep the country's technology giants in check. On Capitol Hill, some lawmakers quickly seized on the government's antitrust action to call again for Congress to rein in big tech companies."
A top Trump political appointee at the State Department allegedly drank alcohol excessively on the job.
"A high-ranking State Department official who is close to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo drank alcohol excessively on 'numerous' occasions while working, even raising a red flag among foreign counterparts, multiple State Department officials told the agency's watchdog for an unpublished report," HuffPost reports. "The investigation was concluded in May and submitted to Pompeo's team, but it is not expected to be officially released. It largely addresses a period between the fall of 2017 and the summer of 2019, when Cam Henderson served in a less senior role. Last August, Henderson became the chief of protocol, an important post that oversees delicate diplomatic events and matters of rank. The revelation about her behavior and apparent impunity adds to the impression that the State Department has become less professional and more politicized under [Trump]. …
"Two department officials also described alcohol-related issues with Henderson to The Washington Post for an August story. … Pompeo tapped Henderson to succeed Sean Lawler without seeking Senate confirmation, breaking with normal practice. Henderson has been deeply involved in Pompeo's controversial practice of holding 'Madison dinners,' swanky taxpayer-funded events featuring the secretary and his wife that some lawmakers and officials at the State Department view as politically motivated ― more about Pompeo's future presidential ambitions than any diplomatic purpose. … Henderson is a longtime GOP operative who worked for years with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie … A State Department spokesperson strongly defended Henderson and attacked the inspector general … No part of the State Department's response directly refuted the idea that Henderson regularly drank to excess on the job."

Unless President Trump or the Commission on Presidential Debates blinks, there might be no debate next week.
"To protect the health and safety of all involved," the bipartisan commission announced this morning that Democratic candidate Joe Biden and Trump would appear "from separate remote locations" for next Thursday night's town-hall-style debate while undecided voters and moderator Steve Scully will still gather in Miami.
Moments later, Trump called into Fox Business for his first interview since disclosing last Friday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. He declared that he is feeling great, claimed without evidence that he is no longer contagious and said he is not going to participate unless he gets to face Biden in person.
"I'm not going to waste my time on a virtual debate," the president said. "That's not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate. It's ridiculous, and then they cut you off whenever they want." Then he baselessly attacked Scully, a veteran C-SPAN host, as a "Never Trumper."
Biden's campaign welcomed the virtual debate, and the former vice president predicted that Trump could change his mind. Speaking to reporters as he boarded a flight for a trip to Arizona, Biden said: "We don't know what the president is going to do. He changes his mind every second, so for me to comment on that now would be irresponsible. I'm going to follow the commission's recommendations. If he goes off and he has a rally, I don't know what I'll do."
Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien issued a statement blasting the commission's "pathetic" move to go virtual: "We'll pass on this sad excuse to bail out Joe Biden and do a rally instead," he said. Stepien issued this statement from home, where he is convalescing from covid-19.
Wednesday's vice-presidential debate in Salt Lake City will be remembered years from now for the plexiglass barriers that separated the candidates – and the fly that landed on Vice President Pence's white head of hair and then rested there, unobstructed, for two minutes. Unfortunately, it distracted many viewers from Pence downplaying the systemic nature of racism in America generally and law enforcement specifically.
The emphasis on the fly and this morning's drama have also distracted from a central theme that has gotten short shrift in the initial round of coverage: Trust.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) opened her first answer by describing Trump's handling of the pandemic as "the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country." She cited Trump's statement to Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward that he wanted to play down the threat of the contagion, as far back as January, because he did not want to create a panic. "They knew what was happening, and they didn't tell you," Harris said. "You respect the American people when you tell them the truth."
"Which we've always done," Pence interjected.
Pence opened his first answer of the debate with two false claims: The first was that Trump "suspended all travel from China" right away. In fact, nearly 40,000 people traveled from China to the United States after the restrictions went into place. Pence's second claim was that Biden had called the restrictions xenophobic. "Biden did call Trump xenophobic, but not obviously in relation to the restrictions that had been announced only minutes before and of which Biden was not aware," Philip Bump explains.
That opening back-and-forth set the tone for the evening and helped illustrate why Trump faces an historic credibility gap with under a month to go until Election Day.
The Washington Post's Fact Checker team documented more than 20,000 false and misleading claims by the president through early July.
This fusillade of falsehoods from this administration has taken a toll on public opinion. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted last month, which had Biden ahead by 10 points nationally, found that 35 percent of likely voters said Trump is honest, compared to 59 percent who said he is not, while 49 percent said Biden is honest, compared to 43 percent who said he's not. That is on par with what a Washington Post-ABC News poll found in May. In our July national poll, we asked people to compare the two nominees: 49 percent said they trusted Biden more while 35 percent said they trusted Trump more."
A poll conducted by CNN while Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed over the weekend found that only 12 percent of Americans said they trusted almost all of what they heard from the White House about the president's health, compared to 69 percent who said they trusted little of the information.
When discussing foreign policy, Harris also pivoted to critique Trump's honesty. She said Biden told her that "foreign policy might sound complicated, but really it's relationships. So just think about it as relationships."
"You've got to keep your word to your friends. You've got to know who your adversaries are and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world," the senator explained. "The thing that has always been a part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesn't understand that, because he doesn't understand what it means to be honest."
Pence shot back: "Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that. They never did."
Harris seemed like she was trying to say the word "facts" as much as possible, and she went out of her way to describe Pew and Moody's as "reputable" outlets when she cited their polling and economic estimates during the debate. Harris also referred to her running mate's propensity for gaffes to make the case that he is unvarnished and therefore trustworthy. "One thing we all know about Joe: He puts it all there. He is honest, he is forthright, but Donald Trump on the other hand has been about covering up everything," she said, proceeding to attack Trump for concealing his tax returns.
When discussing the Supreme Court, Harris even referred to President Abraham Lincoln as "Honest Abe." She told a story about how Justice Roger Taney died 27 days before the 1864 election and claimed that Lincoln said that the winner of the election should get to choose his replacement: "Lincoln's party was in charge, not only of the White House but the Senate, but Honest Abe said, 'It's not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land.' And, so, Joe and I are very clear. The American people are voting right now. And it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime."
Harris's story sounded too good to be true, and it was. Lincoln's true motive for the delay was to keep people in his tent as Election Day neared. Former senator and Treasury secretary Salmon Chase had challenged Lincoln for the Republican nomination in 1860 and really wanted the job. Lincoln disliked him, but Chase had a big following in the GOP.
"The overarching effect of the delay is that it held Lincoln's broad but shaky coalition of conservative and radical Republicans together. And it kept rivals like Chase in line," Gillian Brockell reports. "Chase, who had often been critical of Lincoln in the past, immediately began stumping for the president across the Midwest, sparking rumors of a secret deal … Congress was in recess until early December, so there would have been no point in naming a man before the election anyway. Lincoln shrewdly used that to his advantage. If he had lost the election, there is no evidence he wouldn't have filled the spot in the lame-duck session. Lincoln was, of course, reelected. And the day after the Senate was back in session, he nominated Chase for chief justice."
Brockwell notes that there is one thing Lincoln definitely supported, which Harris repeatedly refused to weigh in on during the debate: court-packing. In 1863, Lincoln and Republicans in Congress passed a law to create a 10th Supreme Court seat for almost entirely partisan reasons. All told, Lincoln appointed five justices in just four years and five weeks as president. In 1869, under President Ulysses S. Grant and with Republican nominees in full control of the high court, a new judiciary act was passed that reduced the number of justices back from 10 to nine to avoid ties.
Pence capitalized on Harris's evasiveness over whether Democrats might try to add seats to the Supreme Court if they win control of the White House and Senate, something liberal activists are pushing them to do. Biden opposed this idea last year during the primaries, but now he declines to rule it out as Republicans rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before the election. "If you haven't figured it out yet," Pence said, "the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court."
More team coverage
Our fact checkers round up 15 suspect claims that were made last night. "Pence took a number of flimsy claims out of the Trump playbook, although he often delivered them more deftly," write Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly, adding that Harris "also stretched the truth at times."
"Pence's soft-spoken debate style was a marked contrast to the excitable and at times belligerent tone Trump took a week earlier in his debate with Biden. But like Trump, he repeatedly went over his allotted time and spoke over moderator Susan Page, ignoring her attempts to keep the debate moving by frequently saying, 'Thank you, Mr. Vice President,'" David Weigel, Michael Scherer and Chelsea Janes report. "Nor was there a major misstep or effort to trod new ground in a way likely to disrupt the race, which has remained remarkably stable, with slight variation, since the late summer."
"Both candidates ducked, bobbed and wove past questions they didn't want to answer, segueing into their preplanned talking points and attacks and largely ignoring Page, as well as her best efforts to enforce time limits," Ashley Parker reports. "Pence employed the strategy most frequently, bulldozing — politely, calmly, resolutely — through Page's pleas to move along and sweeping aside inquiries about everything from Trump's health to his administration's specific plan to protect insurance coverage for people with preexisting health conditions. … The vice president also ignored a question near the end on what he would do if Biden is declared the winner of the election but Trump refuses, as he has threatened previously, to accept a peaceful transition of power."
"Everything about a debate tells voters something," Page said in an interview with her publication, USA Today, after the debate. "So, with both candidates, and especially with Vice President Pence, they didn't address the questions I asked. That is frustrating to me because I spent a lot of time writing those questions, but that is illuminating in its own way to voters, and that was the point."
"Pence had a difficult hand to play," writes Dan Balz, "and he did what he could with the case he wanted to make. But the more he tried, the clearer it became just how much President Trump continues to undermine his own campaign."
"His tone was calm, verging on prayerful at times, but the accompanying words were often bracingly cold — most notably when the subject turned to racial justice," writes Robin Givhan. "Harris laughed when she was appalled by Pence, studiously refraining from frowning or giving the impression that she was angry because being simultaneously angry and Black is treading into treacherous water in our culture of inequality."
Commentary from the opinion page:
E.J. Dionne Jr.: "Harris succeeded by declining to make herself a center of attention."
Alyssa Rosenberg: "The vice-presidential debate was boring. Good. We need more of that."
Gary Abernathy: "Pence ably defended Trump in a way that few, including Trump, have managed to do."
Jennifer Rubin: "Pence should have self-quarantined instead of debating Harris."
Alexandra Petri's satire: "An exclusive interview with the fly from the debate."
Quote of the day
"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking," Harris said during one of the 16 times when Pence interrupted her. (Vox)

A majority of viewers thought Harris won the debate.
A CNN-SSRS instant poll found that 59percent of those polled after the debate said she won, while 38 percent said Pence had the better night, CNN reports. The California senator's favorability rating improved among those who watched, going from 56 percent to 63 percent. Pence's favorability remained the same – 41 percent – in pre- and post-debate interviews. (CNN producers also calculated that the speaking time of both candidates was roughly equal: 36:24 for Harris and 36:27 for Pence.)
The debate had "no questions on the shutdown of the nation's school system and the millions of kids with essentially no current access to organized education," notes Dana Goldstein of the Times. "We live in a gerontocracy in which both children's and parent's needs are so often invisible."
"Through two debates there has been no substantial conversation over immigration," complains Hamed Aleaziz of BuzzFeed.
"The debate was a bucket of warm you-know-what," writes Politico's John Harris. "Neither [Pence] nor [Harris] could escape the fundamental dynamic of the job they are seeking: The vice presidency is by definition minimizing."
"Pence did that typical thing that he does and too many other Republican men do, who think that they own the stage and own the debate and can somehow dominate a female debate opponent," says Lincoln Project co-founder Jennifer Horn, the former chair of the New Hampshire GOP, in an interview with the 19th.
Pence attacked the Obama administration by citing things it polled well on, writes HuffPost's Ariel Edwards-Levy, including its handling of the swine flu and, in retrospect, Obamacare.
"Pence said Trump listens to scientists. That's a joke, right?" asks Mother Jones's Rebecca Leber.
"It was a little hard, by the end of the night, to see either of these politicians effectively leading a national ticket. The debate showed why we've ended up with an election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, despite their obvious flaws," writes the New Yorker's Benjamin Wallace-Wells.
Pence and Harris "politely traded milquetoast zingers … like it was 2012—or some other year before Trump commandeered American politics and remade it in his own image," writes the Atlantic's Russell Berman.

Trump returned to the Oval Office.
"The White House again refused on Wednesday to say when Trump last tested negative for the novel coronavirus, leaving open the possibility that he potentially exposed dozens of people to the deadly virus before the announcement of his positive test early Friday," Toluse Olorunnipa, Josh Dawsey and Parker report. "Speaking on Fox News on Wednesday, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows declined to say when Trump last tested negative, citing privacy. Two officials familiar with the situation said Trump has not been tested daily in recent months. Only rarely has Trump been tested on a machine other than the one produced by Abbott Laboratories, which provides rapid results … The rapid tests are not always accurate." ("We're not asking to go back through a bunch of records and look backwards," said White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern.)
"Trump sought to depict a presidency that has returned to normal, saying on Twitter that he had 'recovered' from the virus. 'Hi, perhaps you recognize me. It's your favorite president, and I'm standing in front of the Oval Office at the White House,' Trump said in a recorded video released on Twitter late Wednesday. The president was recorded while standing in the Rose Garden without a mask. He focused mostly on erroneously pitching therapeutics as a 'cure' rather than emphasizing good public health practices. … 'I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president, because I feel great,' Trump said, pledging to make sure that all Americans receive the same experimental antibody cocktail that was used to treat him, free. 'I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it. This was a blessing in disguise.'… Trump spent much of the day posting all-caps tweets against his perceived enemies. …
"White House physician Sean Conley released a memo Wednesday describing Trump's vital signs as 'stable and in normal range' and announcing that lab work conducted Monday had detected antibodies for covid-19 … The [memo] provided only limited information. … The West Wing remains largely empty, with most aides working from home."
Trump demanded that Water Reed doctors sign non-disclosure agreements.
"During a surprise trip to Walter Reed on Nov. 16, 2019, Trump mandated signed NDAs from both physicians and nonmedical staff, most of whom are active-duty military service members," NBC News scoops. "At least two doctors at Walter Reed who refused to sign NDAs were subsequently not permitted to have any involvement in the president's care … The reason for his trip last year remains shrouded in mystery." It's not clear if Trump made the same demand of Walter Reed staff during his hospitalization this weekend.

Two staffers for Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) tested positive in recent days, and more test results are expected soon, but there is no contact tracing in place and staffers were told not to disclose to roommates that they may have been exposed, per the Wall Street Journal, which also reports that Lamborn told people he does not plan on getting tested. The congressman is expected to travel back to Colorado tomorrow. A spokeswoman said staff members were instructed to protect each other's medical privacy but denied that they were ordered to conceal cases.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows hosted a lavish wedding for his daughter in Atlanta in May with about 70 guests, despite guidelines that banned gatherings of more than 10 people to prevent the virus from spreading, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.

Covid-19 survivors see callousness, not compassion, in Trump’s bout with the virus.
"Rather than bond Trump to the millions of Americans who have suffered from the virus or watched a loved one go through it, Trump's experience with the virus has only deepened the sense of distance that some voters say they feel from a president who has consistently downplayed its severity," Griff Witte reports. "In interviews, Americans whose lives have been upended by the virus said they felt disappointed that the president missed an opportunity to model responsible behavior. They expressed anger that Trump has continued to minimize the virus's threat after receiving deluxe care that the vast majority of people can only dream of at a time when testing and treatments are running low. And they voiced fear that Trump's words and actions would lead to more reckless behavior among his supporters."
Regeneron asked the FDA for emergency use authorization for the antibody therapy Trump received.
This treatment was developed with the use of a cell originally derived from an abortion, according to Regeneron. "The Trump administration has taken an increasingly firm line against medical research using fetal tissue from abortions," the MIT Technology Review reports. "But when the president faced a deadly encounter with covid-19, his administration raised no objections over the fact that the new drugs also relied on fetal cells, and anti-abortion campaigners were silent too. Most likely, their hypocrisy was unwitting. Many types of medical and vaccine research employ supplies of cells originally acquired from abortion tissue. It would have taken an expert to realize that was the case with Trump's treatment."
The New England Journal of Medicine called for U.S. leaders to be voted out of office. "The magnitude of this failure is astonishing," the editors of the prestigious medical journal write. "Reasonable people will certainly disagree about the many political positions taken by candidates. But truth is neither liberal nor conservative."

"Facing a political reckoning as Trump's support plummets and a possible blue tsunami looms, it is now conservatives and Trump allies who are showing flashes of discomfort with the president, straining to stay in the good graces of his core voters without being wholly defined by an erratic incumbent," Robert Costa reports. "For some Republicans, the 11th-hour repositioning may not be enough to stave off defeat. But the criticism, however muted, illuminates the extent of the crisis inside a party that is growing alarmed about its political fate and confused by Trump's tweets and decision-making. … One senior GOP official close to Trump … compared this crossroads to when the 'Access Hollywood' story broke in October 2016 and many Republicans distanced themselves from Trump. … 'The situation is getting worse and worse,' the senior official said. … 'We didn't think it'd be this bad at this point.' …
"In Arizona, Sen. Martha McSally (R), struggling to hold on to her seat … was evasive on Tuesday night at a debate when she was asked about whether she is proud of her support for Trump … On Wednesday, the Cook Political Report said the race between Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison is a 'toss up' … Graham, one of Trump's staunchest allies, tweeted on Wednesday that he did not agree with Trump's decision to stop negotiating with (Nancy) Pelosi until after the election. … Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.), a House member in a tough race, said he also disagreed with the president and would 'strongly urge' Trump to rethink the decision. And in Maine, Sen. Susan Collins (R) did the same as she fends off Democrat Sara Gideon in her reelection race. 'Waiting until after the election to reach an agreement on the next covid-19 relief package is a huge mistake,' Collins said in a statement."
The Department of Justice weakened its long-standing prohibition against interfering in elections.
"Avoiding election interference is the overarching principle of DOJ policy on voting-related crimes," ProPublica reports. "In place since at least 1980, the policy generally bars prosecutors not only from making any announcement about ongoing investigations close to an election but also from taking public steps — such as an arrest or a raid — before a vote is finalized because the publicity could tip the balance of a race. But according to an email sent Friday by an official in the Public Integrity Section in Washington, now if a U.S. attorney's office suspects election fraud that involves postal workers or military employees, federal investigators will be allowed to take public investigative steps before the polls close, even if those actions risk affecting the outcome of the election. …
"Specifically citing postal workers and military employees is noteworthy, former DOJ officials said. But the exception is written so broadly that it could cover other types of investigations as well, they said. Both groups have been falsely singled out, in different ways, by [Trump] and his campaign for being involved in voter fraud." Experts are alarmed that this could be exploited by Attorney General Bill Barr, who has heavily politicized the department, to use the arm of the law as part of an effort to drag Trump to victory.
A Russian bank is trying to trace individuals who uncovered its alleged connections to the Trump Organization.
Two years ago, the New Yorker's Dexter Filkins wrote about a series of mysterious contacts between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, one of the most powerful financial institutions in Russia. The connections, recorded in logs of the Domain Name System, were never explained, and the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank denied that they had been communicating all. "Since then, Alfa Bank's lawyers in the United States have carried out an aggressive campaign to uncover the identity of the sources who gathered the D.N.S. logs, filing lawsuits and serving subpoenas on some of America's leading computer experts, some of whom helped decipher the logs for The New Yorker," Filkins writes. "Two lawsuits—filed against 'John Doe et al.,' the unidentified scientists who discovered the seeming evidence of communication—claim, without offering evidence, that malicious people doctored the data, in an effort to smear Alfa Bank and the Trump campaign. Remarkably, Alfa Bank's legal efforts are proceeding in parallel with the Justice Department and its allies in the conservative press … In recent weeks, scientists and others quoted in my story have been summoned to testify to a grand jury impanelled by [U.S. Attorney John Durham].It is unclear whether lawyers for the Justice Department and Alfa Bank are working together, but they share an interest in pursuing people who have investigated Trump's ties to Russia. 'There's a unity of purpose,' one lawyer involved in the litigation told me."
Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist, approved the release of almost 1,000 pages of materials to the DOJ as part of Durham's probe. The decision follows Ratcliffe's earlier declassification of notes by former CIA director John Brennan, which current and former officials criticized as a political maneuver to bolster the president's claims that Obama administration officials conspired against him. (Shane Harris )
The DOJ acknowledged that FBI notes given to Michael Flynn's defense team contained altered information. Government lawyers said they inadvertently altered dates on copies of notes from two former senior FBI officials that were turned over to the former national security adviser's defense team and filed to the court as potentially exculpatory evidence. (Spencer Hsu and Matt Zapotosky)
ICE announced 128 immigration arrests in "sanctuary" cities as part of a wider pre-election operation. "Privately, ICE and DHS officials acknowledged that the number of suspects taken into custody so far by the 'sanctuary op' did not amount to a major increase in arrests," Nick Miroff reports."While ICE officials have criticized sanctuary policies since the Obama administration, the messaging effort behind this month's campaign has left critics warning a new line has been crossed in the deepening politicization of immigration enforcement during the Trump era."

Facebook expanding restrictions on election ads.
"Facebook said it plans to temporarily suspend all political and issue-based advertising after polls close Nov. 3, a move the company said was intended to limit confusion, misinformation and abuse of its services in the days after the presidential election ," Elizabeth Dwoskin reports. " The social media giant also said it would remove calls for people to watch the polls when those posts use militaristic or intimidating language. Executives said the policy applies to anyone, including [Trump] … The company has previously said it will suspend running new political ads in the week before the election but will allow ads that have previously been approved to continue running."

European allies warn that the move could have devastating humanitarian consequences on a country reeling from the coronavirus and an ongoing currency crisis. The measures will target the few remaining banks not currently subject to secondary sanctions in a move that U.S. allies fear will diminish channels that Iran uses to import humanitarian goods, such as food and medicine.

Trump tweeted that all U.S. troops in Afghanistan should be home by Christmas. His comments come as Afghan government and Taliban negotiators continued negotiations in Doha, Qatar, aimed at forging a political solution to the 19-year war. But there is still no evidence that the Taliban has severed relations with al-Qaeda, a key condition in a deal struck with the Trump administration earlier this year. The level of violence has sharply increased across Afghanistan in recent months. (Missy Ryan and Karen DeYoung)

Kentucky's attorney general is trying to gag a grand juror.
Daniel Cameron (R), a Mitch McConnell acolyte who is considered by many to be his heir apparent, filed a court motion seeking to bar an unidentified grand juror in the Breonna Taylor case from speaking publicly about the proceedings, which the juror alleges that Cameron continues to mischaracterize. The motion came as the city of Louisville released a trove of documents from the police department's internal investigation of Taylor's shooting, which showed other Louisville officers criticizing the raid and casting doubt on the department's justifications for the warrant.

In Oakland, Calif., demands by protesters to defund the police are gaining momentum, even as homicides and violence spike amid a city budget also being ravaged by the recession.

Five of the nine council seats are on the ballot in November, and many of those races are turning on the issue of funding. (Scott Wilson and Holly Bailey)

Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr., a grandson of President John Tyler, died at 95. His father Lyon Gardiner Tyler Sr., alive from 1853 to 1935, was the longtime president of the College of William & Mary in Virginia. Lyon Tyler Sr.'s father, who was born 231 years ago, was the 10th president from 1841 to 1845 and is best remembered for annexing Texas. Lyon's great-grandfather was John Tyler Sr., who lived from 1747 to 1813 and served in the Continental Army and then as governor of Virginia. (NYT)

The novel coronavirus has disproportionately harmed racial minorities and the poor, but President Trump's 12:54 a.m. announcement that he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive is a reminder that no one is safe – not presidents, not princes, none of us.
The president joins at least 7,248,000 other Americans who have tested positive since March. Unlike virtually all of them, he is ensconced in a highly-secure cocoon. Despite Trump's cavalier comments and scoffing at public health guidelines, many people get tested before being allowed in close proximity to him. Access to the Oval Office has been restricted. All visitors have their temperatures taken before entering the White House grounds.
This October surprise upends the presidential campaign with just over a month until Election Day. This will draw fresh attention to Trump's public and private squabbles with a number of the medical experts in his administration over how seriously to take the virus. The diagnosis will also make it difficult for the president to deflect attention to other issues. But it is impossible at this moment to state anything with certitude. How exactly this development impacts the final 32 days of the race depends on the answers to these dozen questions:
1) How sick will the president get?
An unnamed White House official told the Associated Press this morning that the president is experiencing "mild symptoms" but did not specify.
The president's physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement that the Trumps "are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence."
"We are feeling good," the first lady tweeted this morning.
Ronny Jackson, Trump's former White House physician who is now running for Congress in Texas, called into Fox News overnight to claim, without appearing to have first-hand information, that the president is asymptomatic. "I will bet you that he does not develop symptoms, that he moves on and this does not become a big deal," Jackson said, adding that the president will "weather this storm."
"Covid-19 has proved particularly lethal for older people, especially those who are obese and have preëxisting conditions. Trump is seventy-four and overweight," writes New Yorker editor David Remnick. "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, eight out of ten covid-19-related deaths in the United States have been of people sixty-five and older. Trump's doctors say that he is generally healthy—though, on November 16, 2019, Trump was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and Vice-President Mike Pence was reportedly placed on standby. The reasons for that hospital visit remain obscure. At one point, the President went out of his way to deny that he had suffered 'mini-strokes.'"
2) Who else close to the president has the virus?
Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel disclosed this morning, through her spokesman, that she tested positive a few days ago. McDaniel appeared Thursday on Fox News but did not mention her diagnosis. She was with last with Trump at a Sept. 25 fundraiser and has been at her home in Michigan since last Saturday. The RNC statement said McDaniel received confirmation on Wednesday afternoon that she was positive and that she had chosen to get tested after a member of her family had tested positive.
The president got tested after his senior aide Hope Hicks came down with the virus. "Hicks traveled with the president to Pennsylvania for a rally Saturday, to Cleveland for the first presidential debate Tuesday and to Minnesota for another campaign rally Wednesday. Hicks was around the president and top political advisers extensively in recent days preparing for the debate," Josh Dawsey and Colby Itkowitz report. "She was photographed without a mask at the Pennsylvania rally clapping to the Village People's 'YMCA' with other Trump aides and in Cleveland on the tarmac deplaning Air Force One. Her positive test came after she began showing symptoms at the Wednesday rally. A person familiar with the situation said Hicks was quarantined on the plane trip back from Minnesota. …
"After White House officials learned of Hicks's symptoms, Trump and his entourage flew Thursday to New Jersey, where he attended a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster and delivered a speech. Trump was in close contact with dozens of other people, including campaign supporters, at a roundtable event. The president did not wear a mask Thursday, including at the events at his golf course and on the plane … Two people who spent time with him said he did not show noticeable symptoms although he seemed tired and acknowledged to other aides later Thursday that Hicks was ill. … Some aides are expected to stay at home for the foreseeable future … Some members of the Secret Service have also contracted the virus while preparing for presidential events, The Washington Post has reported."
Vice President Pence and second lady Karen Pence both tested negative this morning, according to the White House.
In May, Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller caught the virus. In July, the president's son Donald Trump Jr. tested positive and so did national security adviser Robert O'Brien. But the president continued to test negative at that time.
3) How transparent will the White House be about the president's condition?
The White House's willingness to make demonstrably false statements has undermined its credibility going into a perilous period for the presidency. Moreover, there is a long history of White Houses downplaying the severity of presidential health problems, from President Ronald Reagan's condition after he was shot in 1981 to President Franklin Roosevelt's polio.
4) What kind of schedule will Trump keep while convalescing?
Even if he's feeling fine, how long does the president stay inside the White House? Aides say Trump still plans to host a conference call on covid-19 support for vulnerable seniors at 12:15 p.m. from the residence. But a fundraiser at Trump's hotel in Washington and a rally in Florida that were scheduled for later in the day were both scrapped.
5) Will Trump change his tone about the virus? If so, for how long?
During a prerecorded speech that played at the Al Smith charity dinner in New York on Thursday night, just hours before he revealed his diagnosis, Trump exuded the same optimism that he has for months. "I just want to say that the end of the pandemic is in sight," the president declared, "and next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country."
6) How will Joe Biden adjust?
The Democratic presidential nominee is scheduled to hold two in-person events today in Grand Rapids, Mich. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), is scheduled to stump in Las Vegas. Neither trip has been canceled. Biden's campaign has not answered questions about when he was last tested, but he tweeted this morning that he and his wife wish the first couple a swift recovery: "We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family," Biden wrote.
Only hours before Trump tested positive, the Biden campaign announced plans to begin knocking on doors of prospective voters this weekend after saying for months that doing so was unsafe and unnecessary during the pandemic. But the Trump campaign's advantage on in-person canvassing had made Democrats nervous. Republicans have said their canvassers have already knocked on 19 million doors. Will the Biden campaign still move forward with its door-knocking plans?
Biden is also on television with attack ads against Trump. If the president's condition worsens, that could seem to be in poor taste. Will either campaign pull any of its commercials off the air?
7) Will there be more debates?
The hot topic of conversation in politics yesterday was what changes might be made to the format for the second and third presidential debates to keep them more orderly than the first. Now the question is whether there will be any more in-person debates at all. The vice-presidential candidates are scheduled to debate next week in Salt Lake City.
8) Will Trump resume large-scale campaign rallies?
Trump really hoped to rev up his travel schedule in the final weeks. This throws a wrench in those plans. Already, he was under fire for going to Wisconsin on Saturday despite the state becoming a coronavirus hot spot. Wisconsin reported a record-high 2,887 new cases and 21 more deaths on Thursday. The number of people hospitalized with the virus has skyrocketed over the last week, and Gov. Tony Evers (D) has urged Wisconsinites to stay home, according to the Journal Sentinel.
At Tuesday's debate, Trump defended having big rallies where no one is required to wear facial coverings or to socially distance. "We've had no negative effect," the president said. Biden said that was "totally irresponsible" and his opponent is being foolish. Trump replied: "If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can't. Nobody cares."
If Trump resumes rallies, it's possible that some supporters who might have gone choose to stay away out of an abundance of caution.
9) Will public sympathy lead to a bounce in the polls or are attitudes too hardened for that?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson saw a bump in his approval rating this spring after he recovered from the coronavirus. The 56-year-old was treated on a ventilator in an intensive care unit. "His personal approval ratings skyrocketed from 44% in mid-March to 66% on April 13, immediately after he exited the ICU. But Johnson's spike in approval coincided with the U.K.'s national lockdown, which enjoyed broad public support in the spring. Johnson's approval ratings sank to 35% in late September amid accusations his government has mishandled the pandemic," Time magazine reports.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, 65, also tested positive in July but had a very mild case. ""Bolsonaro's approval ratings also rose a month after he contracted the virus, though this coincided with a push by his government to provide $47 billion of emergency aid money to vulnerable parts of society. Support for the Brazilian President hovered around 33% between April and June, according to Datafolha polling, but rose to 37% in August," Time notes. "In both cases, the absence of detailed polling on the link between the leaders catching the virus and people's support for them—not to mention all the other circumstances that impact people's choices—means it's impossible to say what effect catching the virus had on support for Johnson and Bolsonaro."
Other heads of state have also been infected, including the leaders of Belarus, Bolivia, Honduras, Guatemala and Monaco. (The AP has a running list.)
There are other precedents worth studying, as well: President Woodrow Wilson got sick in 1918 amid the influenza pandemic.
"One of Biden's front-row guests during the debate Tuesday night, whose father died of covid-19, was sharply critical of the president and his family for potentially putting others at risk in the debate hall," Matt Viser reports. "Kristin Urquiza, co-founder of the group Marked by COVID, said that while everyone attending the debate had to test negative, they were also supposed to wear masks. 'And though every one of Biden's guests managed to do this, Trump's guests were shockingly barefaced,' she said in a statement. … 'Irresponsible is an understatement: this is criminal.' Urquiza was invited to the debate to represent her father, who died in June at age 65. … Urquiza said she is working to get tested as soon as possible, and would quarantine until she knew she wasn't putting others at risk. 'I am terrified,' she said. 'I know the darkest result of COVID: an undignified and lonesome death.'"
10) Does the president's diagnosis cause businesses and schools to rethink reopening plans?
The Labor Department announced Friday thatU.S. economy added just 661,000 jobs in September — the smallest monthly job gain since the recovery began in May, another signal that the labor market is cooling off. "In what will be the last monthly jobs report issued before the election on Nov. 3, the unemployment rate dropped to 7.9 percent, putting the rate closer to that of other recent recessions," Eli Rosenberg reports. "The modest gains in jobs were driven by hiring increases in leisure and hospitality, which added 318,000 jobs back in September, mostly at restaurants and bars. … Government employment fell by 231,000 driven by declines in local and state education, a decline economists have been warning about for months. … There are still 10.7 million less people with jobs than there were in February before the pandemic, but now more than half of the jobs lost in March and April are now recovered."
11) Will this cause Trump supporters who have been skeptical of the dangers of the virus to take it more seriously?
"The virus doesn't care if you're rich or poor, a Republican or a Democrat, young or old. No one is immune. Not even the president," said Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), who has faced attacks from Trump for being overly cautious. "My sincere hope is that today's news will serve as a wake-up call to every single American."
12) To what extent do our adversaries seek to capitalize on the potential chaos?
"There's already an onslaught of misinformation about the diagnosis circulating on social media," said former FBI special agent Clint Watts, a distinguished research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. "It's as if a nuclear information bomb exploded on social media," he told Cat Zakrzewski for the Technology 202. "I would expect Russia to amplify, heavy, the uncertainty and play up disastrous scenarios. Or speculate about Biden." Watt said that Russian media sources such as RT are already spreading speculation about Biden's health.
"Any time the president of the United States is at risk is an opportunity to foreign adversaries," added Graham Brookie, the director and managing editor of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Lab. "It's why the United States has contingency and continuity plans in place across the government before a crisis happens," he told Cat. "Those continuity plans need to account for the low likelihood for things like military attacks but a near guarantee of foreign adversaries adjusting ongoing influence operations to the event."
More on the coronavirusFrance announces potential new restrictions as cases surge.
The full-blown second wave France is now experiencing has many restaurateurs worried they will not be able to survive a second shutdown, James McAuley reports from Paris. "For weeks, the country has relied on a regional system to implement restrictions in areas where transmission rates of the virus are high. On Thursday, Health Minister Olivier Véran said Paris could soon join the 'maximum' risk category, which would mean another complete shutdown of bars, restaurants and cafes. Some cities, notably Marseille, are already on the list. Paris so far has avoided further restrictions since a lockdown was lifted in mid-May. But Véran said that in the last 24 hours, the capital crossed multiple thresholds that make it a maximum-risk environment: The transmission rate has risen above 250 cases per 100,000, and the percentage of those who've tested positive for the novel coronavirus who require intensive care is now hovering between 30 and 35 percent." Elected officials in Marseille, already under the stricter closures, criticized the French government for not involving them. "Yes, we've asphyxiated the city," deputy mayor Samia Ghali told France's BFM television.
Spain orders Madrid to lock down as cases soar. Residents will be banned from leaving the city, except on essential trips. But regional authorities said the national government's decision has no legal basis, setting the stage for a political fight. (Sky News)

House Democrats pass a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill despite GOP opposition.
"The legislation, which passed 214 to 207, has no chance of advancing in the Republican-led Senate and is opposed by the White House," Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report. "[But] with the House set to recess Friday through the election, Pelosi (D-Calif.) acceded to demands from moderate Democrats who wanted to take new action … before heading home to campaign for reelection. … Republicans railed against Pelosi for advancing a bill that has no chance of becoming law, accusing her of playing politics instead of trying to strike a bipartisan deal. And even though it was largely pressure from moderate Democrats, some in tough reelection races, that persuaded Pelosi to reverse course and put the bill on the floor, 18 mostly centrist Democrats voted 'no.' …
"Behind the scenes Pelosi was, in fact, working to try to strike a bipartisan deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The two spent the day trading phone calls and offers, and although Pelosi said they remained far apart on some issues, the negotiations were continuing and appeared to be getting into some granular details, such as specific language on a coronavirus testing plan. … Even if they do manage to clinch a deal, however, the White House would still have to sell it to Senate Republicans, who have been highly skeptical of any legislation over $1 trillion. Mnuchin went into the talks with Pelosi with a $1.62 trillion offer … Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has sounded skeptical about a new deal, but in an interview on Fox News Channel late Thursday he said he would evaluate any agreement the House speaker and Treasury secretary come up with."

"Campus outbreaks have fueled tensions in college towns and cities across the country, from San Diego to Morgantown, W.Va., even though there is little evidence so far of spillover into local populations," Karin Brulliard reports. "In some communities, local governments and schools have presented a united front, but increases in cases have stirred resentment among residents and triggered student-directed crackdowns by public health officials. In others, elected officials and university administrators have publicly traded blame and sparred over strategy."

Amazon said nearly 20,000 of its U.S. employees have caught the virus. This includes Whole Foods workers. "The retailer has faced harsh criticism this year as hundreds of workers and critics have said it hasn't done enough to keep employees safe as they work in its warehouses amid a surge in demand to send items to shoppers across the country," Rachel Lerman reports.

The Smithsonian laid off 237 workers. "The layoffs are the first permanent staff cuts made by the world's largest museum organization since it was forced to close its sites March 14. The Smithsonian lost $49 million — from store and restaurant revenue as well as canceled ticketed events, classes and tours — between March and September," Peggy McGlone reports.

Divided AmericaTrump amassed a red-state army in D.C. — and he could do it again.
"The call that came into state capitals stunned governors and their National Guard commanders: The Pentagon wanted thousands of citizen soldiers airlifted to the nation's capital immediately to help control crowds outside the White House in the wake of the death of George Floyd," Aaron Davis reports. "Presidents have routinely activated Guard troops to fight foreign enemies, and in extraordinary circumstances have federalized them to quell civil unrest, using the vast power of the commander in chief. But the June 1 appeal to states was different. Trump was drawing instead on an obscure law ... His action was not an order but a request … While red states jumped to answer the president's call, governors and Guard commanders in blue states were incredulous. The result was a deployment to the nation's capital that military historians say appears to have been without precedent: Over 98 percent of the 3,800 troops that arrived in the District came from states with Republican governors. … The same ability to mobilize National Guard troops from sympathetic states into Washington remains readily available today to Trump, who has repeatedly declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power after the election."
Border Patrol snipers were authorized to use deadly force at Floyd’s burial.
"As a horse-drawn carriage took Floyd's body to its final resting place in Pearland's Houston Memorial Gardens cemetery, planning records show that at least six 'sniper teams' were in place on rooftops and authorized to open fire if the situation spiraled out of control," Vice News reports. "The records, labeled highly confidential, also state that an FBI surveillance aircraft was flown over the burial, and that 'overwatch units' were sent to monitor the crowd for violent 'agitators.' Pearland officials also welcomed a large contingent of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to the city, including dozens of members of the immigration agency's militarized tactical unit. Known as BORTAC, it's equipped with military-grade firepower and commando-style uniforms, and deploys to conflict zones 'around the world,' according to the agency."
A Russian operation masquerading as a right-wing news site is targeting American voters.
The Internet Research Agency, the Russian troll farm accused of meddling in the 2016 election, posed as an independent news outlet to target right-wing social media users ahead of the election, Reuters reports. The pseudo media organization was called the Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens and was run by people associated with the IRA. "The website predominantly focused on U.S. politics and current events, republishing articles from conservative media and paying real Americans to write about politically-sensitive issues. A network of accounts posing as editors and journalists then promoted the articles on social media sites favored by right-wing users. Topics covered by NAEBC ranged from attacks on [Biden] to criticism of the Black Lives Matter movement and praise for Wisconsin shooter Kyle Rittenhouse."

Retired Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster (Ret.) said Trump is "aiding and abetting [Vladimir] Putin's efforts" by failing to acknowledge how the Russian leader tried to manipulate American voters. "This sustained campaign of disruption, disinformation and denial is aided by any leader who doesn't acknowledge it," said the president's former national security adviser. (MSNBC)

As QAnon grew, Facebook and Twitter missed years of warning signs about its violent nature.
It wasn't until this year that Facebook and Twitter began broad crackdowns against the conspiracy theory, Craig Timberg and Elizabeth Dwoskin report. They "waited until this past summer to close or limit the reach of more than 20,000 QAnon-connected accounts and pages after two years of QAnon-fueled threats of violence and numerous real-world crimes. By then, FBI officials, in an intelligence briefing, had warned that QAnon was becoming a potential domestic terrorism threat, and the U.S. Military Academy's Combating Terrorism Center had warned that 'QAnon represents a public security threat with the potential in the future to become a more impactful domestic terror threat.' QAnon adherents made good use of the delay, using the power of those mainstream social media platforms to grow the movement into what many researchers consider the world's largest and most virulent online conspiracy theory."
The GAO will investigate claims of systemic racism within the Department of Veterans Affairs.
A survey of 1,500 union members who are VA employees concluded that nearly 80 percent of staffers said racism is a moderate or serious issue, with more than half reporting they had witnessed racism aimed at veterans, according to the American Federation of Government Employees. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) cited this to request the probe, which the taxpayer-funded watchdog has agreed to do. (Alex Horton)

A federal judge ruled that Bill Barr's national commission on policing violates the law and ordered it to stop work because it seated only people in law enforcement and failed to include members with different perspectives such as civil rights activists, defense attorneys or mental-health professionals. "The commission also did not file a charter, post public notice of its meetings or open them to the public, so even though it has already sent its draft report and recommendations to Barr for release later this month, the judge prohibited Barr from publishing a final report," Tom Jackman reports.
Trump cut the refugee cap to its lowest level ever.
"The Trump administration has capped the number of refugees it will admit into the United States at 15,000 during the next year, a historic low that reflects the president's increasing vilification of immigrants on the campaign trail," Nick Miroff reports. "The 15,000 figure, the lowest since the 1980 Refugee Act took effect, is a drop from the 2020 cap that was set at 18,000. Since March, the number of refugees admitted to the United States fell sharply as the coronavirus outbreak slashed global travel. Fewer than 12,000 refugees have arrived in the past 12 months, statistics show. Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, called the 15,000 cap an 'abdication' of the nation's humanitarian leadership role in the world. … 'It's no surprise that this all-time low comes during an election year,' Vignarajah said. … Under previous Republican and Democratic administrations, the refugee cap typically exceeded 70,000 a year, and Biden has pledged to set the figure at 125,000 per year if elected."

More on the electionMelania Trump said in a secretly recorded conversation: “Who gives a f--- about the Christmas stuff?”
The first lady "was secretly recorded in the summer of 2018 expressing her frustration at being criticized for her husband's policy of separating families who illegally crossed the southern border while at the same time needing to perform traditional first lady duties, such as preparing for Christmas," CNN reports. "'They say I'm complicit. I'm the same like him, I support him. I don't say enough. I don't do enough where I am,' she said in a tape secretly recorded by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend and senior adviser to the first lady … after she left the White House. 'I'm working ... my a** off on the Christmas stuff, that you know, who gives a f*** about the Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?' She continued, 'OK, and then I do it and I say that I'm working on Christmas and planning for the Christmas and they said, 'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?' Give me a f****** break. Where they were saying anything when Obama did that? I can not go, I was trying get the kid reunited with the mom. I didn't have a chance -- needs to go through the process and through the law.' The policy Melania Trump was referring to was different from that of her husband. … Under former President Barack Obama, children were separated from parents only when authorities had concerns for their well-being."
Trump’s campaign finance chair Kim Guilfoyle left Fox News following accusations of sexual harassment.
Guilfoyle, who is dating Trump's son Don Jr., was a Fox News host until 2018, the same year a young woman who had been one of her assistants sent "company executives a confidential, forty-two-page draft complaint that accused Guilfoyle of repeated sexual harassment, and demanded monetary relief," the New Yorker's Jane Mayer reports. "The document, which resulted in a multimillion-dollar out-of-court settlement, raises serious questions about Guilfoyle's fitness as a character witness for Trump, let alone as a top campaign official. … Guilfoyle has maintained that her decision to move from television news to a political campaign was entirely voluntary. In fact, Fox News forced her out in July, 2018 — several years before her contract's expiration date. … Guilfoyle publicly denied any wrongdoing … The draft complaint, which was never filed in court, is covered by a nondisclosure agreement. …
"The assistant alleged that Guilfoyle, her direct supervisor, subjected her frequently to degrading, abusive, and sexually inappropriate behavior; among other things, she said that she was frequently required to work at Guilfoyle's New York apartment while the Fox host displayed herself naked, and was shown photographs of the genitalia of men with whom Guilfoyle had had sexual relations. The draft complaint also alleged that Guilfoyle spoke incessantly and luridly about her sex life, and on one occasion demanded a massage of her bare thighs; other times, she said, Guilfoyle told her to submit to a Fox employee's demands for sexual favors, encouraged her to sleep with wealthy and powerful men, asked her to critique her naked body, demanded that she share a room with her on business trips, required her to sleep over at her apartment, and exposed herself to her, making her feel deeply uncomfortable.
"As serious as the draft complaint's sexual-harassment allegations were, equally disturbing was what the assistant described as a coverup attempt by Guilfoyle … According to those familiar with the assistant's draft complaint, during a phone call on August 6, 2017, she alleged that Guilfoyle tried to buy her silence, offering to arrange a payment to her if she agreed to lie [to a team of outside lawyers hired to investigate sexual misconduct in the company]. … [The lawyers] begun investigating accusations of workplace sexual misconduct involving Eric Bolling, with whom Guilfoyle shared the assistant. … It was all but inevitable that if the assistant accused Bolling of sexual harassment — as in fact she did — Guilfoyle's conduct would come under scrutiny next. … Guilfoyle told her that she needed to know what the assistant would say if she were asked about sexual harassment, and warned her that she could cause great damage if she said the wrong thing."
Mike Pompeo’s politicking is wearing down the patience of allies.
"Foreign officials have accused him of trying to drag their governments into the election battle," Foreign Policy reports. "The problem was clearly on display this week during Pompeo's visit to the Vatican, where Pope Francis refused to meet with the secretary during his visit, with Vatican officials accusing the secretary of state of trying to drag the Holy See into the 2020 U.S. election by criticizing its relations with China. Rome isn't the only place reeling from Pompeo's unprecedented breach of the State Department tradition of steering well clear of politics. In Brazil, lawmakers are still trying to come to grips with the damage done by Pompeo's September visit, ostensibly meant to shore up support for a common front against Venezuela ... While in the Brazilian city of Boa Vista on Sept. 18 — home to 85,000 Venezuelans who have fled the regime of Nicolás Maduro — Pompeo railed against the embattled Venezuelan leader … But some Brazilian lawmakers and former top diplomats bristled at the hawkish overtones, accusing the secretary of state of fueling new tensions between Brazil and Venezuela and using the trip to garner more support among Latin American diasporas in the swing state of Florida."
"There are signs Trump's ground operation is paying off when it comes to registering new voters in key states," NBC News reports. "Of the six states Trump won by less than 5 points in 2016, four — Arizona, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania — permit voters to register by party. In all four states, voter registration trends are more robust for the GOP than four years ago. In Florida, Republicans added a net 195,652 registered voters between this March's presidential primary and the end of August, while Democrats added 98,362 … In Pennsylvania, Republicans added a net 135,619 voters between this June's primary and the final week of September, while Democrats added 57,985."
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issues an order to make it vastly harder to vote in urban areas.
Abbott "said each of the state's counties could provide only one mail-in ballot drop-off location for the November election, a proclamation that quickly spurred criticism and a legal threat from Democrats and election officials," Meryl Kornfield and Felicia Sonmez report. "The executive order, which amended a July 27 order by Abbott that expanded early voting and absentee ballot drop-offs, cites election security as the reason counties must close sites that were already collecting early ballots. … In several Texas counties that have a population of more than 1 million, the order would close several satellite sites. Harris County, which includes Houston and has more than 4.7 million residents, is the state's largest county and the third largest in the United States … [It] has 12 ballot drop-off sites."
Right-wing operatives Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman were charged with intimidating voters, conspiring to violate election law and using a computer to commit a crime, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced, after thousands of residents from at least five states received a robocall aimed at discouraging absentee voting. Each charge against the pair carries a five- or seven-year sentence if they are convicted. (Kornfield)
The South Carolina GOP asked the Supreme Court to reinstate the witness signature requirement for mail-in ballots. The request comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit left in place an order blocking the requirement because of the risks associated with in-person voting during the pandemic. (Ann Marimow)
About 1,600 former Justice Department lawyers accused Barr of using the agency to help Trump win. "We fear that [Barr] intends to use the DOJ's vast law enforcement powers to undermine our most fundamental democratic value: free and fair elections," they write in anopen letter. "Such a blatant politicization and abuse of federal law enforcement power risks immense and lasting harm to our democracy and to the integrity and reputation of the DOJ." (USA Today)

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
In Pennsylvania, women favor Joe Biden by 23 points and men narrowly prefer President Trump by seven points, according to a fresh Washington Post-ABC News poll, which has the Democratic nominee edging the president by nine points overall among likely voters in the Keystone State.
Nationally, a Post-ABC poll released Sunday showed Biden leading Trump by 31 points among female likely voters and Trump leading Biden by 13 points among male likely voters. Trump's lead among men is about the same as his final margin over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but Biden's lead among women is more than twice as large as Clinton's.
These disparities are in line with a flood of other surveys. Barring a significant change in the contours of this contest, the polling indicates that 2020 will probably see the largest gender gap of any presidential election since the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment granted women the right to vote a century ago.
One way to define the gender gap is the difference between the percentage of women and men who back the winning candidate. In 2016, it was 11 points – with 41 percent of women and 52 percent of men backing Trump, according to exit polling. That tied the record set by President Bill Clinton in 1996, when he won reelection with 55 percent support among women and 44 percent among men. (In Pew's study of validated 2016 voters, it was a slightly larger 13-point margin, with 52 percent of men and 39 percent of women supporting Trump.)
Women have favored the Democratic candidate in every election since 1992. But the gender gap did not emerge as a meaningful factor in presidential politics until 1980. Ronald Reagan won that year with support from 46 percent of women and 55 percent of men.
The culture wars of the 1970s, including the emergence of abortion as a major voting issue in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision and the clashes over ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, fueled a divergence in male and female attitudes toward the two parties.
Not only is Trump himself the most polarizing president in modern history, but the fight over his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg appears to be supercharging long-term trends. Between her paper trail as a law professor at Notre Dame and her record as a judge for nearly three years, Barrett has left little to no doubt about her hostility toward abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act, which helped millions get insurance and expanded access to contraception for women.
With the election five weeks away, as polls show the potentially record-breaking gender gap translating to down-ballot races, three Senate Republicans found themselves on the defensive over these issues in debates on Monday night:
In Maine, Sen. Susan Collins's support has tanked ever since she voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2018. With polls showing Collins trailing, after garnering 69 percent of the vote six years ago, the incumbent announced that she will oppose confirming any new justice before the election. But Monday's debate opened with her Democratic challenger, Sara Gideon, attacking Collins for confirming Trump's other judicial nominees. "What we have to focus on is how we get back to a judiciary that is independent once again," said Gideon, according to CNN.
In Iowa, Sen. Joni Ernst struggled to explain her flipflop from opposing a vote for President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, to supporting a rapid confirmation for Barrett. Ernst, trailing in the latest polls, sought to downplay the probability that Barrett would undo abortion rights. "I think the likelihood of Roe v. Wade being overturned is very minimal," Ernst said, according to the Des Moines Register. "I don't see that happening. Truly, I don't see that happening." Ernst joined 38 Senate Republicans and 168 House Republicans earlier this year in asking the Supreme Court to revisit and potentially overturn Roe .
In Montana, Sen. Steve Daines tried to argue that it is unlikely Barrett, if confirmed, and the Supreme Court would actually strike down the ACA. "The experts are saying it's highly unlikely they'll overturn the ACA. That's the consensus of many legal experts," Daines claimed. HuffPost notes that, in July, a Daines spokesman told local newspapers that the senator supports the Trump administration's legal effort to get rid of the "failed law" with "whatever mechanism."
Similar themes will ostensibly come up Tuesday night in Cleveland during the first presidential debate. The Supreme Court is one of the six topics that moderator Chris Wallace said he plans to cover, devoting 15 minutes to the vacancy.
Biden holds an eight-point advantage over Trump on whom Americans trust to handle the Supreme Court appointment. The Post-ABC national poll found that women trust Biden more on the vacancy by a margin of 26 points, 59 percent to 33 percent. Men trust Trump more by 11 points, 52 percent to 41 percent. Similarly, women trust Biden more than Trump to handle health care by a margin of 35 points, 65 percent to 30 percent. Men are split: 47 percent trust Trump, and 43 percent trust Biden.
This national poll, which was conducted after Ginsburg died but before Trump named Barrett, found that 31 percent of women said Trump should nominate and confirm a Ginsburg replacement, compared to 64 percent who said the winner of the November election should get to choose. Half of men also said the winner of the election ought to decide. Finally, 64 percent of Biden supporters in the poll say the court vacancy makes it "more important" that he win the election, compared with 37 percent of Trump supporters who said the same about the president.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), her party's vice-presidential nominee, referenced the polling that shows most Americans prefer to wait until after the election for Ginsburg's seat to be filled. "We're not in the middle of an election year — we're in the middle of an election, an ongoing election. Almost a million Americans have already voted," Harris said in a speech on Monday in Raleigh, N.C.
Harris, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee whose national profile rose during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, plans to leave the campaign trail the week after next to question Barrett. Unlike other Democratic senators, she said that she also plans to sit down with the judge. In her first public remarks since Trump unveiled his selection on Saturday at the White House, Harris emphasized Barrett's record on the ACA, including her criticism of Chief Justice John Roberts's decision to uphold the health-care law in 2012, and her writings on reproductive rights.
"President Trump and his party and Judge Barrett will overturn the Affordable Care Act, and they won't stop there. They have made clear that they want to overturn Roe v. Wade and restrict reproductive rights and freedoms," Harris said. "There is no other issue that so disrespects and honors the work of Justice Ginsburg's life than undoing the seminal decision in the court's history that made it clear a woman has a right to make decisions about her own body."
Harris would be the first female vice president if Biden wins. She is the fourth woman on a major party ticket, following in the footsteps of Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, Sarah Palin in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Republican senators, their advisers and outside allies involved in the effort say they hope Democrats will overplay their hands in the confirmation hearing scheduled to start Oct. 12 by focusing excessively on Barrett's Catholic faith rather than her paper trail on health care, abortion and other hot-button issues where she's out of step with most American women.
"The Women's March organization said it is planning a 'socially distant march' in Washington and more than 30 other cities on Oct. 17, days before Senate Republicans aim to vote on Trump's pick," Samantha Schmidt reports. "The organization plans to organize a rally in Freedom Plaza, followed by a march to the Supreme Court, and estimates that about 10,000 people will participate, according to an application for a permit submitted on Wednesday with the National Park Service."
Many women who voted for the president in 2016 have come to regret that decision. The AP interviewed two dozen Republicans in three traditional swing states and Texas who say they will not support Trump a second time. "My heart will not let me do it. I can't vote for someone who is that ugly to other people," said Shawna Jensen, 47, a school librarian in Texas. "I'm pro-life, but I just feel that Republicans have become so hung up on our abortion stance that we are letting this man ruin us."
Dee Stoudemire, 64, a retired legal administrator in Jacksonville, Fla., stopped supporting Trump after he ordered the withdrawal of troops from Syria. "That was a bat signal to me, that he's not listening to his military leaders," she told the AP. "When you have a leader that cannot and will not listen to his military leaders when it comes to world affairs, you've got a problem."
A new Monmouth University poll shows that 74 percent of registered voters say they plan to watch the first debate tonight, but only 3 percent said they think they are very likely to hear something that will affect their vote.Another 10 percent say that is somewhat likely, while 87 percent say that is not likely.
Who are these few undecided voters still left? In rural Minnesota, Erin Tollefsrud teaches refugee children and is a single mother of her own son. She wants a president who is openhearted yet tightfisted. "Tollefsrud, 35, thought early this year that she'd finally found a candidate who reflects her concerns about climate change, education and racial justice. She liked Andrew Yang in the Democratic primary race, but now she's torn. She's suspicious of Democrats like Biden who she sees as unfamiliar with and unsympathetic to rural residents and gun owners," Marc Fisher, Christine Spolar and Amy Wang write. "But she's appalled by Trump's Twitter persona and coarse rhetoric at rallies. And she's worried that 'there's no fiscal conservative in this race.' Still, she likes the attention Trump pays to rural America and she thinks of him as someone who doesn't flip-flop, who tells it like it is. 'Neither candidate represents me,' she said. …
"Tollefsrud is a classic swing voter, casting ballots for George W. Bush and Barack Obama before going with a third-party candidate in 2016. On Tuesday, she wants to hear whether Biden can hold his own against Trump's insults. 'His age is concerning,' she said. 'If you look at pictures of presidents after their term, they look older, stressed, harried.'"
What to expect tonight
The debate starts at 9 p.m. Eastern and runs 90 minutes without commercial interruption. The Washington Post will air live coverage. I will join anchor Libby Casey in our newsroom for a preview show starting at 8 p.m. and 45 minutes of post-debate analysis. You can stream our programming on washingtonpost.com or here on YouTube.
Due to health guidelines, only about 80 people will be allowed in the audience in Cleveland, compared to about 900 in a normal year. Each person will be required to wear a mask and get tested for the coronavirus. Each candidate is allowed just 20 guests in the hall. Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said that Trump and Biden will not wear masks onstage, but they also will not shake hands. Trump will get the first question.
"Incumbent presidents have, more often than not, stumbled in their first debates, in part because they approach them both overconfident and underprepared," Karen Tumulty notes. "It happened to Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980, Ronald Reagan in 1984, George W. Bush in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2012. For George H.W. Bush, disaster struck in the second debate of 1992, when television cameras caught him checking his watch as an audience member asked him how deeply the recession had personally affected him. Years later, the elder Bush acknowledged what he had been thinking at that moment: 'Only 10 more minutes of this crap.' The current president appears to be following this historical trend. Trump has said he doesn't need to buckle down on briefing books or load down his schedule with practice sessions and mock debates."
After the debate, Joe and Jill Biden plan to leave Cleveland for a train tour that will take him to Alliance, Ohio; Pittsburgh; Greensburg, Pa.; Latrobe, Pa.; and finish in Johnstown, Pa. "The trip is meant to help Biden connect with voters who supported Trump in 2016," reports Annie Linskey, who will accompany Biden for the trip. "This train tour will help Biden drive home the 'Scranton vs. Park Avenue' contrast that he's been trying to draw to highlight his humble roots and Trump's privileged upbringing. During the tour, Biden is set to meet with workers, including union members, to hear 'how they have struggled to get ahead in Trump's economy,' according to the campaign."
The final stop in Johnstown, one of the poorest places in Pennsylvania, will take place near where Trump held a massive rally in 2016. He promised to bring back jobs to the area if elected. Biden will deliver an economic address that will point out Trump's failure to do so and highlight his own plan for recovery.
More on the electionJudges are skeptical of GOP claims of electoral fraud.
"A review by The Post of nearly 90 state and federal voting lawsuits found that judges have been broadly skeptical as Republicans use claims of voter fraud to argue against such changes, declining to endorse the GOP's arguments or dismissing them as they examined limits on mail voting," Elise Viebeck reports. "In no case did a judge back Trump's view — refuted by experts — that fraud is a problem significant enough to sway a presidential election. Some of the Democrats' wins have been preliminary. And in many cases, judges issued split decisions, granting some of the changes sought by liberal plaintiffs and otherwise maintaining the status quo as favored by Republicans.
"But The Post found that judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike have been dubious of GOP arguments that lowering barriers to mail voting could lead to widespread fraud. … Many important rules for voting remain in flux after hundreds of cases were filed in more than 44 states. … So far, GOP lawyers have scored several defensive wins related to mail ballots, such as maintaining North Carolina's witness requirement and keeping in place limitations on third parties collecting and returning ballots or applications, which Republicans deride as 'harvesting,' in Florida, Minnesota and Michigan."

Former aides say Trump is not a religious guy and mocks his Christian supporters behind their backs. "They've heard Trump ridicule conservative religious leaders, dismiss various faith groups with cartoonish stereotypes, and deride certain rites and doctrines held sacred by many of the Americans who constitute his base," the Atlantic's McKay Coppins reports.
Fresh evidence shows the Trump campaign sought to dissuade African Americans from voting in 2016.
"A database built by Cambridge Analytica, the Republican-aligned firm that unraveled over allegations of improper use of Facebook data, disproportionately identified Black voters as ripe for 'Deterrence' in profiles prepared for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, according to a report Monday from Britain's Channel 4 News ," Craig Timberg and Isaac Stanley-Becker report." The firm was founded in part by the Trump campaign's onetime chief executive, Stephen K. Bannon … A database of nearly 200 million American voters, obtained by Channel 4, sorted likely Democratic voters into several categories, such as 'Core Clinton' or 'Disengaged Clinton.' The database put 3.5 million African Americans into a third category called 'Deterrence,' in an apparent bid to single them out for messages designed to dissuade them from voting …
"The database, in Channel 4′s telling, was 'used by Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign' — an allegation the campaign denied. … Trump's 2016 campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5.9 million … Cambridge Analytica's former director of business development, Brittany Kaiser , called the new findings consistent with her understanding of how Cambridge Analytica and Republicans targeted Black voters in 2016." Brad Parscale worked as the digital director on Trump's 2016 campaign. His success at capitalizing on the kind of data that Cambridge Analytica provided is what earned him a promotion to run the president's reelection apparatus for 2020.
A police report includes domestic abuse allegations against Parscale.
"Parscale, who managed [Trump's] campaign for nearly 2½ years until he was demoted in July, was hospitalized for his own safety after threatening suicide while holding a handgun during a confrontation with his wife at his Florida home, local police said Monday. Parscale's wife, Candice, called authorities shortly before 4 p.m. Sunday to report that he had loaded a gun in front of her, prompting her to flee the house out of fear for her safety," Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey report. "Several of the officers who responded to the incident wrote in their reports that Candice Parscale exhibited physical signs of what she said was previous abuse by her husband. One officer wrote that she 'had several bruises on both of her arms as well as scratches and bruising on her face,' and another wrote that they noticed 'several large sized contusions on both of her arms, her cheek and forehead.' … In an audio recording released by the police, Terry Behal — a real estate agent who was showing a house in the neighborhood when Candice Parscale flagged her down for help — can also be heard noticing her bruises. …
"Parscale was angry over being demoted by Jared Kushner — Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, with whom he had been close — rather than by the president himself … But Parscale had spoken to Trump in recent weeks and had returned to the campaign's Arlington, Va., headquarters for meetings. … Parscale, who was still employed by the campaign as of Monday, did not respond to requests for comment. … Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh offered a statement Monday supportive of Parscale: 'Our thoughts are with Brad and his family as we wait for all the facts to emerge.' … The police reports describe Brad Parscale as 'clearly intoxicated,' and a video released by the police shows him, shirtless, holding a beer as he exits his house to come down his driveway to talk to the officers. As he stands in his driveway starting to explain his version of events to an officer, another officer can be heard telling him several times to 'get on the ground,' before tackling him and detaining him with handcuffs."
The Post’s Editorial Board endorses Biden for president.
"He would restore decency, honor and competence to America's government," writes the board, which is independent from the newsroom. "In contrast to Mr. Trump's narcissism, Mr. Biden is deeply empathetic; you can't imagine him dismissing wounded or fallen soldiers as 'losers.' To Mr. Trump's cynicism, Mr. Biden brings faith — religious faith, yes, but also faith in American values and potential. …
"If he takes the oath in the midst of the pandemic's second wave, as is quite possible, with the economy in a tailspin, we can be confident Mr. Biden will rise to the occasion. Why? Because when President Barack Obama and he took office in 2009, the nation was in a similarly frightening tailspin. Mr. Obama trusted his vice president to work with Congress to deliver a bipartisan recovery package and then to help administer it, helping save America's auto industry and the economy more broadly."
The Trump presidencyIntelligence pros say Trump’s debts and foreign deals pose national security risks.
"Security teams at U.S. spy agencies are constantly scouring employee records for signs of potential compromise: daunting levels of debt, troubling overseas entanglements, hidden streams of income, and a penchant for secrecy or deceit to avoid exposure," Greg Miller and Yeganeh Torbati report. "Trump would check nearly every box of this risk profile based on revelations in the New York Times fromhis long-secret tax recordsthat former intelligence officials and security experts said raise profound questions about whether he should be trusted to safeguard U.S. secrets and interests. The records show that Trump has continued to make money off foreign investments and projects while in office; that foreign officials have spent lavishly at his Washington hotel and other properties; and that despite this revenue he is hundreds of millions of dollars in debt with massive payments coming due. …
"The revelations add to long-standing suspicions about Trump's approach to foreign policy and seeming deference to leaders of countries where he has either pursued real estate projects or could do so upon leaving office. The list includes Russia, Turkey and the Philippines, where Trump has sought to erect office towers bearing his name or made millions of dollars from licensing deals and other ventures. … Intelligence officials said the magnitude of Trump's debts pose a vulnerability that is compounded by his determination to prevent his financial records from becoming public. 'It's the hiding of a vulnerability that is a real indicator' of potential security risk, said Jeffrey Edmonds, a former CIA analyst who served in the Trump White House as deputy director for Russia on the National Security Council. 'The more you try to hide something like that, the greater lengths you will go to keep it concealed.'"
Quote of the day
"From a national security perspective, that's just an outrageous vulnerability," said Larry Pfeiffer, who previously served as CIA chief of staff. Pfeiffer, who now serves as director of the Hayden Center for Intelligence at George Mason University, said if he had faced even a fraction of Trump's financial burden "there is no question my clearances would be pulled."

Tax records show how “The Apprentice” rescued Trump.
"From the back seat of a stretch limousine heading to meet the first contestants for his new TV show 'The Apprentice,' Trump bragged that he was a billionaire who had overcome financial hardship. … It was all a hoax," the Times reports. "Months after that inaugural episode in January 2004, Mr. Trump filed his individual tax return reporting $89.9 million in net losses from his core businesses for the prior year. … While the returns show that he earned some $197 million directly from 'The Apprentice' over 16 years … they also reveal that an additional $230 million flowed from the fame associated with it. The show's big ratings meant that everyone wanted a piece of the Trump brand, and he grabbed at the opportunity to rent it out. There was $500,000 to pitch Double Stuf Oreos, another half-million to sell Domino's Pizza … There were seven-figure licensing deals with hotel builders, some with murky backgrounds, in former Soviet republics and other developing countries. …
"Divorced for the second time, and coming off the failure of his Atlantic City casinos, Mr. Trump faced escalating money problems and the prospect of another trip to bankruptcy court. On his income tax returns, he reported annual net losses throughout the 1990s, some of it carried forward year to year, a tide that would swell to $352.8 million at the end of 2002. Few people knew this, however, because he kept up the relentless self-promotion … Trump had only two open golf courses and two more undergoing renovations at the time of his plunge into television, but golf … always seemed destined to become his next financial sand trap. … Beginning in 2006, and continuing over the next decade, he would accumulate 11 more golf courses, forming a new core of what he describes as his empire. … Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's main source of income — 'The Apprentice' and licensing deals — went into a steep decline starting in 2011, falling along with the show's ratings … [His tax records] reveal that as he was pouring money into the golf resorts, he also pulled money out of other places in ways that suggested an immediate need. … In addition, he has huge balances on loans, soon to come due, from Deutsche Bank."
Flashback: When President Jimmy Carter faced a zero-tax bill in 1977, he voluntarily gave the Treasury $6,000. "In 1977, Carter had a problem, according to presidential tax historian Joseph Thorndike. Carter's federal tax burden for 1976 had been zeroed out by a massive investment tax credit he earned for purchasing equipment and buildings related to his peanut farm," Christopher Ingraham reports. "Carter was upset because he had a 'strong feeling' that wealthy people like him should pay at least some taxes. So he voluntarily paid the Treasury Department $6,000, the equivalent to 15 percent of his adjusted gross income and slightly more than the 14 percent paid by average taxpayers that year. How times have changed."
Dave Fahrenthold, who has spent five years studying Trump's finances, says we still don't know the answers to these three questions: "1. Will Trump's tax practices increase the legal trouble he is already facing? The president is already facing at least two state-level investigations of his business. … 2. How much worse are the Trump Organization's finances now, because of the pandemic? Earlier this year, the pandemic and related shutdown measures caused 17 of Trump's golf resorts and hotels to shut down temporarily and triggered layoffs of more than 1,500 employees. … 3. As Trump's companies struggled, how much money did they get from U.S. taxpayers? So far, we've found at least $1.1 million in such payments — including room rentals at Trump's Mar-a-Lago property in Florida, where the president's company charged taxpayers $650 per night. The actual number is likely to be higher, though."
The coronavirusEconomic talks between the White House and Nancy Pelosi resume, as Democrats make a new offer.
Democrats "offered a $2.2 trillion package and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin immediately engaged in talks," Erica Werner reports. "Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke Monday evening and agreed to talk again Tuesday … They are running out of time to reach an agreement before the November election, but their planned talks this week appear to be their most extensive engagement in more than a month. … Senate Republicans and Mnuchin have also said $2.2 trillion is too much to spend, but Mnuchin has said he is open to negotiations. It was not immediately clear whether the talks would bear fruit or whether Democratic leaders would use the bill to provide political cover for moderate House Democrats, who have grown increasingly anxious over Congress's recent inaction on pandemic relief legislation. …
"Mnuchin has said his priorities in a new round of spending would be aid for small businesses and children, among others. He has also talked about providing more assistance to the airline industry and approving another round of stimulus checks. There is some overlap in the White House's goals with the things Democrats included in their new bill. … The bill would fund a range of other programs, including many that Republicans have supported. It would, for example, extend the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses and provide $182 billion for K-12 schools and $39 billion for postsecondary schools. … The biggest budget item in the package would be $436 billion in aid to states, cities, and territorial and tribal governments that have experienced a major budget crunch this year. … The bill would support an assortment of other programs, including $75 billion for coronavirus testing and tracing. … But some Senate Republicans oppose spending any more money at all. … It's unclear how that dynamic — coupled with the Senate's focus on filling the Supreme Court vacancy — could affect the chances for a deal."
The CDC’s credibility has been eroded by internal blunders and external attacks.
"The agency's response to the worst public health crisis in a century … has been marked by technical blunders and botched messaging. The agency has endured false accusations and interference by Trump administration political appointees. Worst of all, the CDC has experienced a loss of institutional credibility at a time when the nation desperately needs to know whom to trust," Lena Sun and Joel Achenbach report. "This harsh assessment does not come from political or ideological enemies of the CDC. It comes from the agency's friends and supporters — and even from some of the professionals within the agency's Atlanta headquarters. … One veteran researcher … said Friday that morale is at an all-time low. … Inside the CDC, staffers acknowledge [Director Bob] Redfield's limitations as a leader but are fearful that, if he is ousted or quits, the White House will install someone of a more distinctly political or ideological bent — such as Scott Atlas, a Stanford University neuroradiologist … who has said pandemic fears are overblown."
The CDC will decide which people should receive the initial doses of a coronavirus vaccine once it is approved by the FDA: "There is no precedent for a vaccine rollout of this scale, said Michael Fraser, chief executive of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. That's why the CDC's troubles are so inopportune. 'It's just unnerving,' he said. … The agency's most chronic problem has been the inability to speak directly and persuasively to the American public. To a large extent, that's because it has been muzzled — and sometimes directly criticized — by political operatives in the Trump administration. … The public has not heard consistently from CDC scientists who possess the expertise to help people understand the virus … The CDC has not held a briefing in three months. … A person close to Redfield said the former Army physician has struggled with his ethics because of a belief in the importance of the chain of command. … Redfield has told colleagues he plans to leave at the end of his term, regardless of who wins in November."
Documents show White House officials pressuring the CDC on school opening guidance.
"The effort included Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator," the Times reports. Olivia Troye, who worked as Vice President Pence's homeland security, counterterrorism and coronavirus adviser until she left the White House last month , "said she was repeatedly asked by Marc Short, the vice president's chief of staff, to get the C.D.C. to produce more reports and charts showing a decline in coronavirus cases among young people. … According to Ms. Troye, Mr. Short dispatched other members of the vice president's staff to circumvent the C.D.C. in search of data he thought might better support the White House's position. …
"In another instance, Dr. Birx took a direct role in an effort to push the C.D.C. to incorporate work from a little-known agency inside the Department of Health and Human Services , the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The document worked on by the mental health agency struck a different tone from the cautious approach being proposed by the C.D.C., warning that school closures would have a long-term effect on the mental health of children. … C.D.C. scientists pointed out numerous errors in the document … But the gist of the mental health agency's position — stressing the potential risks of children not attending school — became the introductory text of the final C.D.C. policy, leaving some officials there dismayed."
A Mississippi teacher is alternating between two groups of students and knows that one is falling behind.
"Danielle Whittington teaches 40 fourth-grade students each day but she has not met all of them in person. In her hybrid classroom, 15 are at home, and the rest are in school — and, she says, she is worried that the two groups are not getting the same education," Sarah Fowler reports. "For students at home, Whittington gets to school each morning at 6:30 to record 15-minute videos, which walk the remote learners through the day's online assignments. … She said she is certain many of the students at home are alone, doing their work with no help from an adult. 'They will be delayed,' she said of the virtual learners. 'They're not going to be as advanced as the kids that are sitting in this class.' … At night, she responds to parent emails — but she doesn't have Internet access at home, so she parks her car on the highway where she can get a signal."

The announcement was made "hours after an unidentified juror filed a court motion criticizing the attorney general's statements and asking to share details so that 'the truth may prevail,'" Hannah Knowles reports. "The attorney general said he will provide the information Wednesday on a judge's order, despite concerns the release could compromise an ongoing investigation and cause other repercussions. Lawyers for Taylor's family and a slew of leaders, including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D), have urged Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R) to make the secretive grand jury process public, as questions mount over last week's charging announcement. … 'There is a compelling public interest for these proceedings to be released of a magnitude the city and Commonwealth have never seen before that could not be confined, weaving its way across the country,' reads the juror's motion to release information. It suggests the attorney general has used jurors 'as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility.'"

"Support our troops," said a digital advertisement from a joint fundraising arm of President Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee. That message, released on Sept. 11, was under a stock photo of a Russian-made MIG-29 fighter. Moscow has exported this model of jet, which was designed to counter the capabilities of U.S.-made F-15 and F-16 jets, to other American adversaries, including North Korea, Iran and Syria. A soldier in the image is carrying a Soviet-developed AK-47 assault rifle.
The Trump team's MIG miscue, which was first reported by Politico and has since been taken down, is ironic considering the lengths to which the president and his aides have gone to reject any ties to Russia.The president has mused in his stump speech lately that he's "probably entitled" to serve a third term because he lost so much time over the past three-and-a-half years defending himself against what he angrily denounces as "the Russia hoax," a reference to the various investigations into him and his 2016 campaign.
This comes amid a cascade of new books, fresh accusations and press reports that are shining a spotlight on the president's record of softness toward a revanchist Russia and the Kremlin's attempts to interfere, again, in the U.S. presidential election.
The Washington Post's Bob Woodward reports in his new book, which goes on sale today, that Trump's former director of national intelligence Dan Coats, previously a Republican senator from Indiana, "continued to harbor the secret belief, one that had grown rather than lessened, although unsupported by intelligence proof, that [Vladimir] Putin had something on Trump." Woodward writes in "Rage": "How else to explain the president's behavior? Coats could see no other explanation."
Former FBI counterespionage chief Peter Strzok reveals in his new memoir, "Compromised," that federal investigators believed there was a possibility that Trump might be a modern-day "Manchurian candidate."Strzok opened the FBI's 2016 investigation into whether Trump's campaign coordinated with the Kremlin to help his election. He was ultimately removed from former special counsel Bob Mueller's team because of private text messages with FBI lawyer Lisa Page that disparaged the president.
"We certainly had evidence that this was the case: that Trump, while gleefully wreaking havoc on America's political institutions and norms, was pulling his punches when it came to our historic adversary," Strzok writes in the book. "Given what we knew or had cause to suspect about Trump's compromising behavior in the weeks, months, and years leading up to the election, moreover, it also seemed conceivable, if unlikely, that Moscow had indeed pulled off the most stunning intelligence achievement in human history: secretly controlling the president of the United States — a Manchurian candidate elected."
Ultimately, Mueller said his investigation "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its election interference activities." "We did not address 'collusion,' which is not a legal term," Mueller explained last year. "Rather, we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy. It was not." But the former FBI director said his findings do not explicitly exonerate the president, which Trump has continued to claim. The president continues to characterize the FBI's investigation into his campaign and advisers as "spying."
Strzok has been promoting his book far and wide, from "Meet the Press" on NBC to "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central. "I don't think that Trump, when he meets with Putin, receives a task list for the next quarter," Strzok told the Atlantic's Anne Applebaum. "But I do think the president is compromised, that he is unable to put the interests of our nation first, that he acts from hidden motives, because there is leverage over him, held specifically by the Russians but potentially others as well."
Strzok elaborates in the book: "Trump's apparent lies — public, sustained, refutable, and damaging if exposed — are an intelligence officer's dream. For that very reason, they are also a counterintelligence officer's nightmare."
Trump's longtime former lawyer Michael Cohen also released his own memoir last week, "Disloyal," that highlights the president's efforts to cultivate Russian investors. "A large part of the posturing and praising of Putin was a way to keep the Trump Organization's options open with the Russian leader," Cohen writes in the book, referring to the 2016 campaign, which he said Trump "assumed he would lose." Cohen also alleges that when Trump sold a mansion to a Russian buyer in 2008 for an inflated price, making a $54 million profit, he assumed Putin was secretly behind the deal. "He believes that Putin controls all of Russia and all of its wealth, and anything like the purchase of this home had to have been through or with the permission of Vladimir Putin," Cohen explained to Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Cohen went to jail for lying under oath during a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (Ret.) has not written a book, but he has started giving interviews. The Purple Heart recipient left the Army in July after Trump ordered his removal as the National Security Council's director for European affairs in the wake of his damning testimony during the House's impeachment inquiry. Vindman arranged that infamous July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during which Trump asked for the "favor" of investigating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden when his counterpart brought up a desire to buy Javelin antitank missiles to counter Russia's ongoing occupation in eastern Ukraine.
During a lengthy interview with The Atlantic that published on Monday, Vindman explained why he agreed to appear publicly before the House Intelligence Committee despite pressure not to do so. "I just had a visceral reaction to what I was hearing," he said. "I suspected it was criminal, but I knew it was wrong. … Trump was putting the squeeze on this leader to conduct a corrupt investigation. Trump knew he had them over a barrel. I found it repulsive and un-American for an American president to try to get a leg up by pressuring a foreign leader to get dirt on an American politician."
Jeff Goldberg, the magazine's editor in chief, asked Vindman whether he believes Trump is an asset of Russian intelligence. "President Trump should be considered to be a useful idiot and a fellow traveler, which makes him an unwitting agent of Putin," said Vindman. "They may or may not have dirt on him, but they don't have to use it. They have more effective and less risky ways to employ him. He has aspirations to be the kind of leader that Putin is, and so he admires him. He likes authoritarian strongmen who act with impunity, without checks and balances. So he'll try to please Putin."
Vindman said Trump does not operate within the traditional boundaries of Russia policymaking. "In the Army, we call this 'free chicken,' something you don't have to work for—it just comes to you. This is what the Russians have in Trump: free chicken," the retired lieutenant colonel said. "With previous Democratic and Republican administrations, there have been left and right guardrails that helped define what was acceptable in terms of Russia policy. I thought we were operating within those boundaries. With Democrats, it might have been more engagement; with Republicans, it could have been more hard power. I didn't know precisely what Trump's boundaries would be, but I did think we would be operating within boundaries."
Trump has repeatedly ripped into Vindman before and after having him escorted from the White House. He has accused him of having "problems with judgement, adhering to the chain of command and leaking information." The president maintains that his July 25 call was "perfect."
Vindman explained that he's coming forward before the election because he believes "it's important for me to tell people that I think the president has made this country weaker," and that "we're mocked by our adversaries and by our allies, and we're heading for more disaster." The Soviet-born Vindman is now studying for his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University and serving as a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania this academic year.
"Truth is a victim in this administration," Vindman told the Atlantic. "I think it's Orwellian. The ultimate goal of this president is to get you to disbelieve what you've seen and what you've heard. My goal now is to remind people of this."
Last Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on a member of Ukraine's parliament for running an "influence campaign" against Biden, describing Andriy Derkach as "an active Russian agent for over a decade" who has maintained "close connections with Russian intelligence services." Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has met at least three times with Derkach since late last yearand publicized the Ukrainian lawmaker's unfounded claims on his podcast and elsewhere, per Paul Sonne, Josh Dawsey and Karoun Demirjian:
"The Treasury Department said Derkach had 'directly or indirectly engaged in, sponsored, concealed or otherwise been complicit in foreign interference in an attempt to undermine the upcoming 2020 U.S. presidential election.' In addition to Derkach, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on three individuals from the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based troll factory that created fake accounts on social media during the 2016 campaign in attempt to influence the election. The sanctions come a day after a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security alleged in a whistleblower complaint that he was told to stop providing intelligence reports on the threat of Russian interference in the 2020 election in part because it 'made the President look bad.'
"Derkach, a former member of Ukraine's Russia-leaning Party of Regions, was educated at the Higher School of the KGB in Moscow … His father was a longtime KGB officer … Since last year, Derkach has been running a full-fledged campaign against Biden … Derkach's allegations were seized upon by One America News, a favorite network of the president that has featured pro-Trump conspiracy theories. One America News conducted interviews with Derkach and publicized his allegations against Biden … Giuliani said he met Derkach for the first time when the Ukrainian lawmaker came to the One America News studio in Washington in November 2019 …
"In an interview with The Post earlier this year, Giuliani said that he knew Derkach 'quite well' and that the Ukrainian lawmaker 'has been very helpful to me.' Asked if Derkach, had provided him with materials, Giuliani said, 'Oh, my God, yeah.' Giuliani, who has been trying to spark Justice Department investigations into Biden, spoke extensively about the documents he received from Derkach. He said Derkach had reviewed and shared prosecutor files from Ukraine. Giuliani denied he was being used as pawn in a Russian influence campaign, saying Derkach didn't seem pro-Russian."
William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said last month that Russia is "using a range of measures" to interfere in the 2020 election. Trump has pointed to the part of the same report that said China and Iran do not want to see him reelected. "Some U.S. officials criticized Evanina for appearing to equate the efforts of China and Russia when the Kremlin was interfering much more directly," Shane Harris, Ellen Nakashima and Dawsey report. "In his statement, China is listed first, followed by Russia and then Iran, which he described as motivated to interfere in the election but not yet taking any actions. 'Between China and Russia, only one of those two is trying to actively influence the outcome of the 2020 election, full stop,' said a senior U.S. official, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information."
The Trump world figure everyone in Washington was buzzing about on Monday was Michael Caputo, installed by the president this spring as the assistant secretary of health and human services to oversee pandemic-related communications, despite lacking any background in health care. After news reports over the weekend highlighted how Caputo and an aide have been trying to edit scientific reports that are supposed to be free from political influence, the Trump aide posted a video on Facebook Live. In it, he urged Trump's supporters to prepare for an armed insurrection after a contested election, accused government scientists of "sedition" and peddled a litany of other conspiracy theories. Caputo boasted in his Facebook talk "that the president had personally put him in charge of a $250 million public service advertising campaign intended to help America to get back to normal," the New York Times reports.
Caputo was passed over for jobs in the Trump administration at the beginning of the administration but remained in the public eye during the Mueller probe. "Caputo himself drew the attention of Mueller's investigators in part because he had had contact with a Russian who offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign," Yasmeen Abutaleb, Lena Sun, Dawsey and Roz Helderman report in today's newspaper. "In May 2016, Caputo said, a Russian man approached his then-business partner, Sergey 'George' Petrushin at an art gallery opening in Florida, claiming to have information that could be helpful to Trump's campaign. Petrushin connected him with Caputo, who arranged for him to meet with political operative Roger Stone, a longtime friend. According to the Mueller report, which described the episode, investigators found no link between the Russian man's outreach and the broader effort by Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.
"As a political adviser and public relations specialist, Caputo also had lived for a time in Moscow in the 1990s, where he worked on a campaign reminiscent of 'Rock the Vote' on behalf of then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin," my colleagues note. "Returning to the United States, Caputo took a contract in 2000 working for the Russian conglomerate Gazprom Media to improve Vladimir Putin's image in the United States. He later told the Buffalo News that he was 'not proud of the work,' adding, 'at the time, Putin wasn't such a bad guy.'"
Speaking of Roger Stone, a Justice Department spokeswoman said Monday that the inspector general has begun reviewing Attorney General Bill Barr's controversial intervention in the sentencing recommendation for the longtime political adviser to the president.Stone was convicted of lying to the House Intelligence Committee during its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
"Earlier this year — when Stone was still awaiting his sentence — Barr personally intervened to overrule the sentencing recommendation career prosecutors had offered to the court, prompting all four of them to withdraw from the case. Two have since publicly criticized the move as being politically motivated, with one testifying under oath before Congress about it," Matt Zapotosky reports. "Prosecutors had recommended Stone deserved a sentence of seven to nine years in prison, which is what federal sentencing guidelines had called for. But Barr thought otherwise, and — after career prosecutors withdrew — the Justice Department proposed a less severe penalty. Stone was sentenced in February to serve three years and four months in prison for impeding the congressional investigation. Trump commuted that penalty in July, before Stone was to begin serving his term."
Finally, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny – an outspoken critic of Putin and his regime – posted a picture of himself on Instagram today from his hospital bed in Germany. It is the first image we have seen of the 44-year-old since he was poisoned with a nerve agent and fell ill during an Aug. 20 flight in Russia. "Hi, this is Navalny," he wrote in Russian. "I have been missing you. I still can't do almost anything on my own, but yesterday I managed to breathe on my own for the entire day."
"A German military lab has determined that Navalny was poisoned with Novichok, the same class of Soviet-era agent that Britain said was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018. On Monday, the German government said independent tests by labs in France and Sweden backed up its findings," the AP reports from Berlin. "The Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons also is taking steps to have samples from Navalny tested at its designated labs, Germany has said. The Kremlin has bristled at calls from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders to answer questions about the poisoning, denying any official involvement."
Earth in the balanceVisiting the burning West, Trump questioned the scientific consensus that climate change is making the fires worse.
"In California, Trump sought to pin the blame for the fires on another culprit — forest management — while shrugging off warnings that human-caused climate warming will continue to make Western states a tinderbox with annual fires that destroy communities. 'It will start getting cooler. You just watch,' he said during a briefing with state and local leaders in McClellan Park," Seung Min Kim and Brady Dennis report . "California leaders focused on climate change during their briefing with Trump. … Wade Crowfoot, the secretary of the state's Natural Resources Agency, pushed the issue more aggressively after the president dismissed concerns that temperatures were on the rise, telling Trump, 'I wish science agreed with you.' The president responded: 'Well, I don't think science knows, actually.' … He claimed Monday that he had spoken to a foreign leader — whom he did not name — who insisted that his or her country has 'trees that are more explosive [than] they have in California, and we don't have any problem because we manage our forests.'"
In Wilmington, Del., Biden excoriated Trump as a "climate arsonist" for ignoring the "undeniable, accelerating, punishing reality." He likened the president's stewardship of natural disasters to his handling of the pandemic and racial tensions. "If he gets a second term, these hellish events will continue to become more common, more devastating and more deadly," the Democratic presidential nominee said. Biden promoted climate policies with wide support and avoided more politically thorny topics like the Green New Deal.He did not take questions after his speech.

At least 35 have died in the Western wildfires.
"Oregon fire crews continued to battle the more than 30 fires raging across the state, where more than 1 million acres have been scorched and, according to Gov. Kate Brown (D), at least 10 people have been killed. More than 3,000 people were staying in shelters run by local counties, Oregon officials said, which are also following protocols to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus as residents face overlapping crises. In California, officials say at least 24 people have been killed. Fire crews are still fighting 28 major wildfires in the state, where more than 3.2 million acres have burned and more than 4,200 structures have been destroyed since the middle of August. One death has been reported in the state of Washington," Paulina Firozi and Andrew Freedman report . "The U.S. Postal Service announced it is temporarily shuttering post offices in the three states because of high winds and the continued fires. At a Monday news conference, Brown said she sent a letter to Trump requesting that he declare a major disaster in the state of Oregon."
Oregon residents are struggling to live with the relentless smoke.
"It's been a week since Deborah Stratton breathed clean air. The 54-year-old and her friend evacuated their homes in Estacada, Ore., last week as flames approached. They spent days sleeping in their cars in a Walmart parking lot, using their last $12 on showers at a truck stop," Samantha Schmidt reports . "But the smoke followed them, hanging heavy in the air, sticking to the back of Stratton's throat. 'It burns your chest,' Stratton said … As white, thick clouds hover over buildings and highways, a miserable reality is setting in for Oregonians: They can flee from the fires, but they can't escape the smoke. … In hospitals across the state, health officials already are seeing the impact of the hazardous air. Ten percent of all emergency-room visits in Oregon are for asthma-like symptoms …State officials said they plan to send 250,000 N95 respirator masks to agricultural workers and Native American tribes to protect them from the smoke. And they do not expect to see somewhat clearer skies until late in the week."
Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are bracing for Hurricane Sally.
"Sally continued to gather strength as it meandered off the Gulf Coast, an oaf of a storm that could linger with hard rain and 100-mph winds threatening to shove massive amounts of storm water onto the shores of Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana," Darryl Fears, Maria Sacchetti and Freedman report . "The thud of nail guns pierced the air as residents boarded up houses at the last minute or fled the low-lying coast to higher ground. 'I blocked the windows off and hope for the best,' said Tyrone Adams, a part-time courier whose 57th birthday is two days after Sally is expected to make landfall Tuesday. … In yet another sign of a dangerous and troubling time, Sally is one of at least five tropical systems that swirled across the Atlantic on Monday, the most since 1971, when there were six. In an era of human-caused climate change and warming waters, September has set a record for the most named storms to date in the Atlantic, said Colorado State tropical weather researcher Phil Klotzbach. The season has seen a record year for tropical activity in the Atlantic, with 20 named storms forming and obliterating the typical average of 11. …
"Even more storms are possible this week, as disturbances move off the coast of Africa and take advantage of ocean temperatures that are warmer than average. After the next storm, forecasters will be forced to dip into the Greek alphabet for names, which would be the earliest this rare occurrence has happened. … Sally is expected to strike the Mississippi coast Tuesday morning as a Category 2 hurricane. With its slow forward speed, the National Hurricane Center expects the storm to be a lingering unwelcome guest, producing heavy rains that could deluge parts of the Gulf Coast with more than two feet of rain. This would cause widespread flooding. If torrential downpours continue for hours in New Orleans, the capacity of the city's pumping system would be greatly challenged."
Two major Atlantic glaciers are tearing loose from their restraints.
"Located along the coast of the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica, the enormous Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers already contribute around 5 percent of global sea-level rise. The survival of Thwaites has been deemed so critical that the United States and Britain have launched a targeted multimillion-dollar research mission to the glacier. The loss of the glacier could trigger the broader collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which contains enough ice to eventually raise seas by about 10 feet," Chris Mooney reports . "It's just the latest in a flurry of bad news about the planet's ice. Arctic sea ice is very close to — but likely to not quite reach — a record low for this time of year. Last month, Canada lost a large portion of its last major Arctic ice shelf. And in Greenland, the largest still-intact ice shelf in the Northern Hemisphere ... just lost a large chunk of ice, equivalent in size to roughly two Manhattan islands, according to the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. Experts there blamed the fracture on a strong general warming trend and temperatures that have been 'incredibly' high in the northeast of Greenland in recent years."
Scientists spotted potential signs of life in the Venus atmosphere.
"An international team of astronomers has detected a rare molecule in the atmosphere of Venus that could be produced by living organisms, according to a study published Monday. The discovery instantly puts the brightest planet in the night sky back into the conversation about where to search for extraterrestrial life," Marisa Iati and Joel Achenbach report . "The researchers made clear this is not a direct detection of life on Venus. But the astronomical observations confirmed the highly intriguing presence of the chemical phosphine near the top of the acidic clouds that blanket the planet. Phosphine is a simple molecule produced on Earth by bacteria and through industrial processes. As a result, it is on the list of molecules — oxygen being another — considered by scientists to be potential 'biosignatures' of life on Earth-sized planets whose atmospheres can be viewed through telescopes."
The coronavirusMedicaid rolls are swelling amid the pandemic. It will only get worse. Nevada is Ground Zero.
"By the most recent count, the roster of Nevadans on Medicaid has climbed from fewer than 644,000 in February, the month before the state reported its first case of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, to about 731,000 through August. That 13.5 percent increase places Nevada among at least three states, along with Kentucky and Minnesota, where the cadre of people on Medicaid has spiked that much," Amy Goldstein reports. "If the past is a guide, this is merely the beginning. During the Great Recession from late 2007 to mid-2009 and previous bad economic spells in the history of Medicaid, Americans have turned to the program more gradually than to unemployment benefits, food stamps and other aid for people sliding out of comfortable lives. …
"With Nevada's tourism-fueled economy stalled, the unemployment rate soared to 30.1 percent in April, the highest ever recorded for any state in any month. … Some casinos' lights are back on, but fewer than one-third of workers have returned to their jobs … Even Nevada's most recent reported unemployment rate — 14 percent for July — is higher than the nationwide rate at the Great Recession's worst. … The spiraling demand for Medicaid is colliding with a diminished ability by the state to pay for it. With Nevada confronting a $1.2 billion deficit and a requirement to balance its budget, the legislature has taken steps to slow the program's spending — notably, curbing payments to doctors, hospitals and others who care for Medicaid patients to save $53 million through next summer. That 6 percent rate cut is the largest so far in the nation."
More cities and states are opening bars and restaurants, despite mounting evidence of potential danger.
"States that have reopened bars experienced a doubling in the rate of coronavirus cases three weeks after the opening of doors, on average. The Post analysis — using data provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates cellphone location information — found a statistically significant national relationship between foot traffic to bars one week after they reopened and an increase in cases three weeks later," Rachel Weiner, Chris Alcantara and Andrew Ba Tran report . "A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of nearly 300 adults who tested positive for the coronavirus found that they were more than twice as likely to have dined at a restaurant in the two weeks before getting sick than people who were uninfected. Those who tested positive and did not have close contact with anyone sick were also more likely to report going to a bar or coffee shop. The same effect was not seen in visits to salons, gyms and houses of worship, or in the use of public transportation. … Few states make their contact-tracing data available, but in two that do — Colorado and Louisiana — bars and restaurants are responsible for about 20 percent of cases traced to a known source. San Diego traced nearly one-third of community outbreaks to restaurants and bars, more than any other setting. But Louisiana's experience suggests bar patrons contribute more to the spread of the virus than restaurant diners."

A federal judge said Pennsylvania’s shutdown restrictions are unconstitutional. Trump rejoiced.
"Shutdown restrictions ordered by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus were unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled Monday — a decision that was quickly celebrated by Trump, who said he hopes the decision is followed by similar pronouncements in other states," Meryl Kornfield reports . "The state's limits on gatherings and closure of nonessential businesses violated the First Amendment and the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment, according to a 66-page opinion by U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV, a Trump appointee. The governor's office confirmed it will appeal the decision. … Trump retweeted nearly two dozen posts about the blow to the Democratic governor's oversight of his state. … At a 'Latinos for Trump' roundtable Monday night, the president claimed, without evidence, states will open everything Nov. 4 and said he hopes other judges will strike down coronavirus mandates."
Trump’s first rally in months was staged as a rebuke to coronavirus restrictions.
"The Sunday night gathering came as the pandemic has caused at least 190,000 deaths in the United States, with the number expected to pass 200,000 sometime before Trump holds his next official campaign events on Friday," Anne Gearan and Josh Dawsey report . "On Monday, Trump held another indoor campaign event at a luxury hotel in Phoenix that was billed as a roundtable with Latino supporters. The White House pool reporter traveling with Trump described the scene as looking much like a rally, with more than 100 people crowded closely together inside a ballroom. Television footage showed mask-free supporters waving campaign signs. 'I know this was supposed to be, you know the fake news, they said that this is supposed to be a roundtable, but it looks like a rally,' Trump said. 'But it is a rally because we love each other.' …
"Many around the president are acutely aware that a potential surge in coronavirus cases and deaths close to the election could be disastrous, according to campaign and White House aides, but they are mostly bowing to Trump's desire to pack the house. … According to campaign documents reviewed by The Post, campaign officials presented Trump and other top aides with a proposal for drive-in rallies in the early months of the pandemic. Supporters could then stay in their cars and watch Trump from the stage … Two advisers close to Trump … said the return to indoor rallies may not be a permanent one. 'I wouldn't expect to see one of those every week,' one of the officials said. 'It's not an ideal situation.'"

More on the electionsTommy Fisher, a North Dakota contractor, scored $2 billion in Trump border contracts.
"Fisher had been trying to land a border wall contract for two years, without success, when the group We Build the Wall called him in April 2019 about a project in New Mexico. We Build the Wall had raised more than $20 million telling donors it would put up barriers on private land along the U.S. southern border. The group's board members were well-connected right-wing celebrities led by former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon. Now they needed a contractor to do some actual wall-building," Nick Miroff reports . "Eighteen months later, Bannon and three others from We Build the Wall have been arrested and accused of fraud for allegedly siphoning more than $1.3 million away from the project. … Fisher's fortunes have been going in the opposite direction. … Altogether, the Trump administration has bestowed $2 billion in wall contracts on Fisher during the past nine months, a lucrative streak for a company that earlier had been repeatedly passed over by the Army Corps of Engineers in favor of larger and more established firms.
"Through ties to GOP figures close to the president, including Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), and the partnership with We Build the Wall, Fisher has upended the federal procurement process to become Trump's go-to builder at the border. Fisher's ascent is as much the result of hustle and self-promotion as the highly personalized way Trump has managed the construction of his $15billion steel-and-concrete barrier, one of the most expensive federal infrastructure projects in U.S. history. … The fencing he put up in New Mexico for We Build the Wall is too short for government specifications, according to a Customs and Border Protection memo published last month by the Nation that laid out the agency's concerns about the structure. It was built too far back from the international border line, it lacks hydrology studies and permits, and its sensor cables were installed on the wrong side of the fence, leaving them more vulnerable to vandalism, according to the memo."
A federal appeals court gave Trump the greenlight to deport hundreds of thousands of TPS holders. "The 2-1 ruling by the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted a block on Trump's ending of temporary protected status, or TPS, for more than 300,000 people. The administration could expel people from Sudan, Nicaragua and Haiti as soon as March and from El Salvador by November 2021," NBC News reports . "The appeals court ruling means that those immigrants will be required to find other ways to remain in the U.S. legally or depart after a wind-down period of at least six months, longer in the case of El Salvador. However, the case is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, which could delay the outcome. … The Biden campaign has called the TPS decisions 'politically motivated,' and it has said Biden would protect enrollees from being returned to unsafe countries."
A nurse-turned-whistleblower says an immigration detention center for ICE in Georgia performed questionable hysterectomies, refused to test detainees for covid-19 and shredded medical records. "The complaint to the Homeland Security Department's internal watchdog relies on accounts of Dawn Wooten, who worked full-time as a licensed practical nurse at the Irwin County Detention Center until July, when she was demoted to work as needed," the AP reports.
Homeland Security said it won't make officials available for questioning in the House's investigation of the department's response to the Portland, Ore., protests. A department spokeswoman argued that the House Intelligence Committee had unreasonably broadened its investigation's scope after receiving a whistleblower complaint from Brian Murphy, who until recently was in charge of the department's intelligence office. Murphy alleged that senior DHS officials, acting on White House orders, tried to color intelligence reports in ways that favor Trump's campaign rhetoric. ( Shane Harris )
A judge ruled that Chad Wolfe is likely unlawfully serving as DHS secretary and temporarily blocked asylum restrictions. Judge Paula Xinis found that former acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan's appointment was invalid under the agency's order of succession, so he lacked the authority to ensure Wolf's installation as Acting Secretary, CNN reports . Xinis found that, by extension, Wolf filed the role without authority and promulgated the challenged asylum restrictions "in excess" of authority.
A bug in Biden’s campaign app gave anyone access to millions of voter files.
"Vote Joe" allows Biden supporters to encourage others to vote in November by uploading their phone's contact lists to see if their friends and family members are registered to vote. "The app uploads and matches the user's contacts with voter data supplied from TargetSmart, a political marketing firm that claims to have files on more than 191 million Americans. When a match is found, the app displays the voter's name, age and birthday, and which recent election they voted in," TechCruch reports . "While much of this data can already be public, the bug made it easy for anyone to access any voter's information by using the app. The App Analyst, a mobile expert who detailed his findings on his eponymous blog, found that he could trick the app into pulling in anyone's information by creating a contact on his phone with the voter's name. Worse, he told TechCrunch, the app pulls in a lot more data than it actually displays. By intercepting the data that flows in and out of the device, he saw far more detailed and private information, including the voter's home address, date of birth, gender, ethnicity and political party affiliation, such as Republican or Democrat. The Biden campaign fixed the bug and pushed out an app update on Friday."

"The decision comes after the Wisconsin Elections Commission declined on Aug. 20 to put presidential contender Howie Hawkins and his Green Party running mate, Angela Walker, on the Nov. 3 ballot because their signature petitions featured two different addresses for Walker. State election officials had argued that the campaign failed to fix the discrepancy according to state requirements," Amy Gardner reports . "A reversal of that decision would have triggered a scramble across the state among election officials, who would have had to order new ballots — and find the money to pay for them — while facing imminent state and federal deadlines to send them to voters."

A Facebook whistleblower said the company ignored global political manipulation.
"The 6,600-word memo, written by former Facebook data scientist Sophie Zhang, is filled with concrete examples of heads of government and political parties in Azerbaijan and Honduras using fake accounts or misrepresenting themselves to sway public opinion. In countries including India, Ukraine, Spain, Brazil, Bolivia, and Ecuador, she found evidence of coordinated campaigns of varying sizes to boost or hinder political candidates or outcomes, though she did not always conclude who was behind them," BuzzFeed News reports . "'I have personally made decisions that affected national presidents without oversight, and taken action to enforce against so many prominent politicians globally that I've lost count,' she wrote. The memo is a damning account of Facebook's failures. It's the story of Facebook abdicating responsibility for malign activities on its platform that could affect the political fate of nations outside the United States or Western Europe. It's also the story of a junior employee wielding extraordinary moderation powers that affected millions of people without any real institutional support, and the personal torment that followed."

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
Election Day is eight weeks from today. Absentee ballots started going out this past Friday in North Carolina, and in-person voting starts next week in Minnesota. The first presidential debate, moderated by Fox News's Chris Wallace, is three weeks from tonight.
This post-Labor Day sprint, when most voters historically start paying close attention to politics, comes amid an aggressive push by President Trump to approve a vaccine to inoculate against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 186,000 people in the United States.
Democratic challenger Joe Biden, after spending most of the past six months campaigning virtually from Delaware, is poised to significantly step up travel to swing states. He visited Harrisburg, Pa., on Monday, as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) flew to Milwaukee for her first in-person campaign events since being named as his running mate. Vice President Pence also stumped in Wisconsin for the holiday.
Lawmakers return to Washington today from their summer recess, which they took despite failing to deliver another relief package for the tens of millions of Americans facing financial distress amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
In addition to the recession and pandemic, the nation continues to experience its worst season of racial unrest since 1968, the year of another critical presidential election. The protests sparked by George Floyd's killing in police custody on Memorial Day continued through Labor Day weekend. But the protests and counterprotests have taken on a scarier, deadlier edge. More people have been taking to the streets toting guns, which is never a sign of a democracy in good health. Meanwhile, scenes of rioting and looting have alienated many White moderates in the suburbs who consider themselves allies of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Against this backdrop, here are eight questions that we will be able to answer over the course of the next eight weeks:
1) Can Biden run down the clock?
This race is Biden's to lose, but he certainly can still lose it. Polling shows the former vice president maintaining a durable lead over Trump in the national polls. The race will tighten; it always does. But the two party conventions appear to have done little, if anything, to change the contours of the race.
Monday was the fifth day in a row that Trump responded to a report in the Atlantic magazine that he denigrated military veterans as "losers" and "suckers." The president again called the story a "hoax" and said his personal dislike for the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) is based on philosophical differences, not because he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. In 2015, Trump said McCain was a "loser" and that he preferred "people who weren't captured."
There are now 56 days until the election. The pool of genuinely undecided voters is unusually small. Every day Trump is on the defensive is a good day for Biden. Every day the incumbent is not expanding his base of support is a squandered day for the incumbent.
2) Will there be a vaccine that people trust?
During his 45-minute news conference on Monday afternoon, Trump claimed a coronavirus vaccine could come "during the month of October." Strategists in both parties agree that, if this actually happened, it could be a boon for his reelection hopes. "The vaccine will be very safe and very effective, and it'll be delivered very soon," the president said. "You could have a very big surprise coming up."
"However, many experts in Trump's administration have cautioned that such a rapid timeline seems overly optimistic," Ashley Parker reports. "The lead scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, for instance, told NPR that a vaccine was 'possible but very unlikely' to be available by October or November. Former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb told 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that a vaccine for widespread use will likely be 'a 2021 event.' If a vaccine were created before the end of 2020, it would probably be used for targeted populations, such as health-care workers and nursing home residents, Gottlieb said."
"Trump has repeatedly offered similar promises, adding to the pressure scientists and officials at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health feel to develop, test and authorize a coronavirus vaccine on what some of the president's aides refer to as 'Trump time,'" Phil Rucker, Josh Dawsey and Yasmeen Abutaleb reported in Sunday's newspaper. "Several Trump aides said one key to the president winning reelection is having a vaccine or demonstrating rapid progress toward one … There is intense disagreement over whether the FDA should use its emergency authority to clear a vaccine before it is formally approved, which some in the scientific community say could be dangerous. …
"Inside the West Wing, there is some concern and nervousness about 'potential politicization' and people not trusting a vaccine if they believed it was produced in a 'rushed process,' according to a senior administration official … The administration … is planning a $150 million public service announcement campaign to convince people that the vaccine is safe, effective and can be trusted, this senior official said. The communications strategy developed at the White House would limit Trump's personal messaging about a vaccine — other than to 'spike the football,' as the senior official put it."
The number of coronavirus cases in the United States nearly quadrupled during the summer to upward of 6.2 million. "From Memorial Day weekend through the unofficial end of the season Monday, the number of Americans who died of covid-19 shot up from just under 100,000 to more than 186,000," my colleagues report on today's live blog.
"Infectious-disease experts are warning of a potential cold-weather surge of coronavirus cases — a long-feared 'second wave' of infections and deaths, possibly at a catastrophic scale. It could begin well before Election Day, Nov. 3, although researchers assume the crest would come weeks later, closer to when fall gives way to winter," Joel Achenbach and Rachel Weiner report. "The Labor Day holiday weekend is a traditional time of travel and group activities, and, like Independence Day and Memorial Day, could seed transmission of the virus … And viruses tend to spread more easily in cooler, less-humid weather, which allows them to remain viable longer. As the weather cools, people tend to congregate more indoors. The coronavirus has a relatively long incubation period, and the disease progression in patients with severe illnesses also tends to be drawn out over several weeks. As a result, any spike in deaths will lag weeks behind a spike in infections. …
"A model produced by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and published Friday forecasts a 'most likely' daily death toll of 1,907 on Election Day, roughly double the current toll. Under the IHME forecast, the numbers would continue to rise until early December, peaking at more than 2,800 deaths daily. By year's end, 410,000 people in the United States will have died under the model's most-likely scenario. That's more than double current fatalities. The model also produced best-case and worst-case scenarios — ranging from 288,000 to 620,000 deaths by Jan. 1 — depending on the degree to which people wear masks, adhere to social distancing and take other precautions."
3) Will Congress pass another covid-19 relief bill?
During his Monday news conference, Trump defended his refusal to meet with congressional Democratic leaders to negotiate a stimulus package aimed at mitigating the economic fallout from the contagion. "They don't want to make a deal because they think, if the country does as badly as possible, … that's good for the Democrats," Trump told reporters. "I'm taking the high road by not seeing them."
"Despite weeks of high-level talks between the White House and Democratic congressional leaders, a bipartisan compromise is increasingly unlikely before the election," Politico reports this morning. "Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other top Senate Republicans have been scrambling to round up votes for a narrow economic stimulus package they could put on the floor and hammer Democrats for opposing. The $500 billion-plus proposal includes $300-per-week federal unemployment payments on top of regular state benefits, another round of funding to aid small and medium-sized businesses, liability protections for businesses, schools and charities, and $105 billion for education, among other provisions. … But it's unclear whether McConnell has at least 51 GOP votes for the plan. Some Senate Republicans have been pushing for language related to 'school choice' programs, complicating the process for McConnell and party leaders. And the measure almost certainly does not have the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster."
"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and his Democratic colleagues remain opposed to the Republican initiative. They've joined with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in calling for at least $2 trillion in new spending, and Senate Democrats will block further action if it comes up for a vote this week. … While both sides insist they want a compromise, neither is making any real concessions that would be needed to get there. The only good news heading into the September session is that Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have reached a tentative agreement to continue funding federal agencies beyond the Sept. 30 deadline, taking the possibility of a government shutdown largely off the table. Some lawmakers and aides have discussed attaching relief provisions to a stopgap spending bill, but reaching a consensus there could be difficult. …
"Some in the White House also don't have a strong sense of urgency. Asked if he felt comfortable with the state of the economy if a coronavirus relief deal wasn't reached, Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg TV, 'We can absolutely live with it.' … Senate Republicans are privately playing up reports that moderate House Democrats are pressing Pelosi to compromise on a relief package. They're circulating quotes from a dozen Democrats in swing House races calling for additional economic help for financially strapped Americans. … A large bloc of Senate Republicans, concerned about the tidal wave of deficit spending this year, believes the U.S. economy will recover without additional government aid. McConnell, however, also has a number of vulnerable GOP senators up for reelection in less than two months, and they've been pressing him for action."
Last week's unemployment report showed the economy added 1.4 million jobs in August, sending the unemployment rate to 8.4 percent. "Yet just over half of the 22 million total jobs lost between February and April have not returned, and prominent economists are warning about the potential for a downturn in the coming months," Eli Rosenberg reports. "The job gains for August were driven by hiring in government, particularly temporary census workers, who accounted for 238,000 new positions — more than 1 out of 6 of the jobs added overall. … And the numbers of unemployed and underemployed workers who are still able to qualify for unemployment assistance remain historically high: Twenty-nine million people are drawing some form of unemployment aid, according to the latest figures from the Labor Department.
"Friday's jobs report noted that workers are spending more time unemployed, close to 17 weeks in August, up from just two in April, which economists say represents another worrying trend. Longer unemployment periods correlate with worse economic outcomes and lower re-employment rates. … Other indicators, such as card use transactions, show that spending on things like restaurants, gas, clothing and hotels may also be leveling off. Data from the employee scheduling company Homebase showed that the recovery of small businesses, as measured by companies opening and employees working, flatlined from July through August, after a period of improvements. On ZipRecruiter, a major job postings site, the number of listings started falling off in mid-August after 10 weeks of steady increases. …
"Signs of economic insecurity abound. More than a quarter of Americans say they are worried about losing their jobs, according to a recent Gallup poll. The number of people who are working part-time because they can't get full-time jobs has gone down to about 7.5 million — but that's still up 3 million from six months ago. Businesses are increasingly pessimistic, too. Some 46 percent of small businesses surveyed said it would take six months to recover from the pandemic, up from 31 percent in April, according to the Census Bureau's Small Business Pulse survey."
A jobs report will come out the Friday before the election.
4) Will there be more bloodshed in the streets?
A day of tense confrontations between backers of Trump and Black Lives Matters protesters turned deadly on Aug. 29 when a self-described member of antifa, a loosely knit group of far-left activists, allegedly fatally shot a supporter of the Patriot Prayer group, who friends said was wearing a hat with the right-wing group's insignia. The suspected shooter was killed last week during a confrontation with federal law enforcement, as they sought to take him into custody.
A few days earlier, a 17-year-old Trump supporter was charged with homicide, accused of fatally shooting two people in Kenosha, Wis., amid protests unleashed by the police shooting of Jacob Blake.
More people across the ideological spectrum have been showing up with long guns to protests. This was the case in Louisville on Saturday before the Kentucky Derby. As emotions run high, the risk of more violence grows.
5) How real is the Trump campaign’s apparent cash crunch?
The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee announced last week that they raised $365 million in August, beating a one-month fundraising record that Barack Obama's campaign set in 2008 – of $193 million. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee have not announced their August haul yet.
The lead story on the front page of today's New York Times explores how the Trump campaign squandered what was a $200 million cash advantage over Biden in the spring. "Of the $1.1 billon his campaign and the party raised from the beginning of 2019 through July, more than $800 million has already been spent. Now some people inside the campaign are forecasting what was once unthinkable: a cash crunch," Shane Goldmacher and Maggie Haberman report. "The campaign hired a coterie of highly paid consultants (Mr. Trump's former bodyguard and White House aide has been paid more than $500,000 by the R.N.C. since late 2017); spent $156,000 for planes to pull aerial banners in recent months; and paid nearly $110,000 to Yondr, a company that makes magnetic pouches used to store cellphones during fund-raisers so that donors could not secretly record Mr. Trump and leak his remarks."
Brad Parscale, the former campaign manager who was demoted this summer, was expensing a car and driver for himself, and the campaign even spent more than $800,000 promoting his Facebook and Instagram pages. Bill Stepien, who was promoted to replace Parscale, nixed a proposal to spend $50 million in costs related to coalitions groups, including an idea to spend $3 million so that a NASCAR car could be plastered with Trump's name. At Trump's direction, the RNC has spent more than $6 million on "donor mementos."
"The number of staff members allowed to travel to events has been pared back to avoid what one senior campaign official described as 'sponsoring vacations,'" the Times reports. "Most visibly, the Trump campaign slashed its August television spending, mostly abandoning the airwaves during the party conventions. In the last two weeks of the month, Mr. Biden's campaign spent $35.9 million on television, compared with $4.8 million for Mr. Trump."
Bloomberg News reports today that Trump has discussed spending as much as $100 million of his own money on his reelection campaign: "The billionaire president has talked about the idea with multiple people, though he hasn't yet committed to any self-funding. Though Trump personally contributed $66 million to his 2016 campaign, it would be unprecedented for an incumbent president to put his own money toward winning a second term."
6) Does Biden outperform the low expectations Trump has set for him in the debates?
Trump has perhaps given his challenger a gift by spending so much time trying to define him as "Sleepy Joe." If Biden can exude energy and competence during the debates, he will have exceeded the expectations that the president has set. This happened during the Democratic convention. Some of the president's most prominent supporters – like radio personality and Medal of Freedom recipient Rush Limbaugh – falsely suggested afterward that Biden's speech had been taped in advance and edited together to make him look good. In fact, reporters in the room saw Biden give the poetic speech live.
Quote of the day
"Look at how he steps. Look how I step," Biden, 77, said when a Pennsylvania TV reporter asked about claims from Trump, 74, that the former vice president has lost a step. "Watch how I run up ramps, and he stumbles down ramps, okay? C'mon." (ABC27)

The presidential debates are scheduled for Sept. 29, Oct. 15 and Oct. 22. The vice-presidential debate is Oct. 7.
7) Will there be problems with mail delivery?
About 195 million Americans are now eligible to cast ballots by mail for the Nov. 3 election — at least 83 percent of voters, according to a Post tracker.
"More than 534,000 mail ballots were rejected during primaries across 23 states this year — nearly a quarter in key battlegrounds for the fall — illustrating how missed delivery deadlines, inadvertent mistakes and uneven enforcement of the rules could disenfranchise voters and affect the outcome of the presidential election," Elise Viebeck reported recently.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has promised he will postpone many of his planned changes to the U.S. Postal Service until after the election so that they will not affect ballot delivery. But Democrats remain skeptical. After all, Trump publicly threatened to block USPS funding to limit its ability to process ballots for the November election.
House Democrats said they will launch an investigation of DeJoy and called for his immediate suspension following accusations that he reimbursed employees for campaign contributions they made to his preferred GOP politicians, an arrangement that would be unlawful. "Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in a statement late Monday that the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which she chairs, would begin an investigation, saying that DeJoy may have lied to her committee under oath," Amy Gardner reports. "Maloney's announcement came a day after The Washington Post reported allegations that DeJoy and his aides urged employees at his former North Carolina-based logistics company to write checks and attend fundraisers on behalf of Republican candidates. DeJoy then defrayed the cost of those political contributions by boosting employee bonuses, two employees told The Post."
8) How blatant will foreign interference become?
Trump suggested Monday that China is interfering in the election and trying to undermine him by encouraging protests. "Trump tweeted a Breitbart article quoting author and columnist Gordon Chang, who said the Chinese Communist Party is 'trying to make life very difficult' for the President by 'fueling' violent Black Lives Matter protests," CNN reports. "Intelligence officials have said they have uncovered evidence that Russia is currently interfering in the election to hurt Biden's campaign. Separately, some evidence has already emerged about Moscow's efforts, including Facebook's announcement last week that a troll group that was part of Russia's attempt to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election is trying to target Americans again. But while the intelligence community has assessed that China and Iran prefer Trump to lose in November, officials have offered no indication, to date, that either country is acting on that preference in the same way as Russia, according to public statements issued by the intelligence community and sources familiar with the underlying evidence."
America is burningRight-wing protesters gathered outside Portland, adding to the tensions surrounding ongoing demonstrations.
"More than 1,000 supporters of Trump, including some aligned with white nationalist extremist groups, gathered in northwest Oregon on Monday night in a show of force against left-wing protesters, creating even more tension in a region that has been rocked by weeks of protests," Samantha Schmidt, Fenit Nirappil, Abigail Hauslohner and Tim Craig report . "Hundreds of cars, trucks, tractors, motorcycles and at least one RV hoisted Trump flags and blasted 'God Bless The U.S.A.' from truck bed speakers for a 'cruise rally' through the suburbs of Portland. Some members of the group then drove about 50 miles to Salem, where they gathered in front of the state capitol. Armed with rifles, pistols, knives and clubs, the far-right demonstrators at one point charged into a smaller group of liberal counterprotesters, knocking at least one activist to the ground.
"The event's organizers said their 'Oregon For Trump 2020 Labor Day Cruise Rally' was designed to show support for the president, following weeks of protests and violent clashes between protesters and police, as well as between protesters and pro-Trump counterprotesters in downtown Portland. … There were also families with young children and adherents of the QAnon conspiracy theory. Some identified themselves as members of the Proud Boys, a self-identified western chauvinist group that the FBI has said has ties to white nationalism. … The Portland rally caps a holiday weekend that saw fresh protests and political demonstrations erupt in cities nationwide, some of which became violent on Friday and Saturday. By end of the weekend, the number of protesters in many cities had dwindled, with only scattered clashes between demonstrators and police. …
"Trump spent part of his Labor Day lashing out at racial justice demonstrators and elected officials in Portland, as well as in New York and Rochester, N.Y., where tensions had been running high after a video surfaced last week showing a fatal encounter between police and [Daniel Prude], a Black man who had been suffering a mental health crisis. 'Rochester N.Y., Brooklyn N.Y., Portland - All had bad nights, all weakly run by Radical Left Democrat Governors and Mayors! Get the picture?' Trump said on Twitter. … Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren (D) responded by urging residents in her town to ignore Trump, accusing him of trying to 'incite people' to further his own election-year political ambitions."

A Salt Lake City police officer shot Linden Cameron, a 13-year-old autistic boy, after his mother called 911 for help. The mother, Golda Barton, had called in hopes that responders could help hospitalize her son, who was having a mental crisis. But the officer instead shot him, leaving him with injuries to his intestines, bladder, shoulder and ankles. Barton said she's gotten few answers from police. The mayor pledged an investigation would be quick. ( Tim Elfrink )
Days of protests in Rochester ended peacefully last night, with no reported arrests or injuries. The rallies began on Wednesday last week after the Democrat and Chronicle reported Prude's story. He died in March after being restrained by Rochester police officers.
Louisville has a new interim police chief: Yvette Gentry, the first woman and the third Black person to serve in the role. Louisville residents, particularly those in West End, have been at the heart of more than 100 days of protest over the March 13 shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police in her own home. ( Courier-Journal )
Jacob Blake, the rare survivor at the center of protests, has started telling his own story. "Your life — and not only just your life, your legs, something that you need to move around and move forward in life — could be taken from you like this, man," Blake said, snapping his fingers for emphasis, in a video from his hospital bed released over the weekend. ( NYT )
The West faces an “extremely dangerous” fire threat after a historic weekend heatwave.
"After one of California's hottest weekends ever observed, a severe fire threat encompasses much of the state and expands over large portions of the western United States. Yet, in a shocking example of weather whiplash, parts of the Rocky Mountain states are bracing for a 60-degree temperature drop and accumulating snow within 48 hours of triple digit heat," Jason Samenow reports . "The Creek Fire in the Sierra National Forest, about 290 miles north of Los Angeles, grew from first detection Friday night to over 78,000 acres as of Monday afternoon. The explosive blaze generated towering pyrocumulonimbus clouds that triggered lightning and probably spawned fire tornadoes. At least 10 people were injured from the fire, with more than 200 rescued by the California Air National Guard after evacuation routes were cut off. The weekend blazes pushed the area burned in California to more than 2 million acres, the most burned on record in a single wildfire season since modern records began in 1987, even before the most dangerous part of the fire season had begun, according to Daniel Swain, a climate researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles."

Unusually strong winds in California threatened to knock down power lines and ignite more wildfires, prompting the state's largest utility, PG&E, to plan power cutoffs for more than 500,000 people, despite record heat. The shutoffs began late Monday, Bloomberg News reports .
A separate wildfire was sparked by a gender reveal party. "The El Dorado Fire in San Bernardino County has scorched 9,671 acres and was only 7% contained as of late Monday night," CNN reports . Cal Fire investigators determined that "the fire was caused by a 'smoke-generating pyrotechnic device' used at a party on Saturday morning in El Dorado Ranch Park in Yucaipa." Sadly, this is not the first time a gender-reveal gimmick has started a massive fire. In 2017, an off-duty Border Patrol agent shot a rifle at a target packed with an explosive as part of a gender reveal, igniting a fire in Arizona that grew to nearly 47,000 acres.
The new world orderRecords shed light on the online harassment campaign Jamal Khashoggi faced before his death.
"A few months before he was killed, Khashoggi witnessed an ominous change in the kind of attention he was getting from his estranged homeland," Joby Warrick reports . "The usual critiques of his essays on Arabic social media became harsh and personal, and occasionally threatening. Influential Saudis reviled him on Twitter as an 'extremist,' a 'criminal' and a 'donkey,' attacks that were instantly repeated and amplified by scores of other Twitter accounts, some of them linked to Saudi officials. … Nearly two years after the killing, a review of Twitter records by U.S. experts is shedding new light on the pattern of allegedly coordinated abuse and intimidation during Khashoggi's final months, when he was living in Virginia, a campaign that some officials say may have violated U.S. laws, with potentially serious implications for the relationship between Washington and Riyadh."
Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor announced Monday that eight people have been sentenced to prison terms between seven and 20 years for the killing of the Washington Post contributing columnist. "The statement did not name the defendants. They were all believed to be members of a 15-man hit squad that traveled to Turkey from Saudi Arabia in October 2018 before killing and dismembering Khashoggi, a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul," Kareem Fahim reports . " The rulings came after a trial that was closed to the public and the news media and that was criticized by human rights groups as lacking transparency. … And the Saudi ruling on Monday failed to answer the most urgent questions about the murder, including who had ordered it and the whereabouts of Khashoggi's remains. The CIA concluded with 'medium to high confidence' that Mohammed, who effectively rules Saudi Arabia, had ordered the killing, which he has denied."
"These verdicts carry no legal or moral legitimacy. They came at the end of a process which was neither fair, nor just, or transparent," tweeted Agnès Callamard, a U.N. human rights expert who conducted an investigation into the killing.
Khashoggi's fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, said in a statement: "The Saudi authorities are closing the case without the world knowing the truth of who is responsible for Jamal's murder. Who planned it, who ordered it, where is his body?"
Shots were fired on the India-China border for the first time in decades.
"India and China accused each other on Tuesday of firing warning shots during a confrontation the day before at their disputed border in a marked escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors," Joanna Slater, Niha Masih and Gerry Shih report . "Longstanding protocols observed by both countries forbid the use of firearms. Such protocols did not prevent the two countries from engaging in their deadliest violence in nearly 50 years in June, when soldiers armed with clubs studded with nails and metal rods clashed in a remote area of the western Himalayas. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed. The number of Chinese casualties remains unknown. Both countries moved thousands of troops as well as tanks, artillery and fighter jets to areas close to the disputed and unmarked border, which is known as the Line of Actual Control. Despite numerous rounds of talks, tensions remain high. …
"Apart from fighting a war in 1962, India and China have largely resolved flare-ups along their 2,200-mile border through dialogue. In 1975, four Indian soldiers were killed in the eastern Himalayas, the last time both countries acknowledged the use of firearms at the frontier."

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is out of a medically induced coma and responsive.
"Navalny, who was poisoned last month with a nerve agent similar to the Soviet-era chemical weapon Novichok, was brought out of an induced coma, and his condition has improved, German doctors said," Robyn Dixon and Ruby Mellen report . "A statement from the Charité clinic in Berlin said he was responding to voices, but it was too early to know the long-term impact of the poisoning. The clinic's statement said that Navalny, an acerbic critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was being weaned off a ventilator. … The German government announced last week that a military laboratory had found irrefutable evidence that Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent in the same group as Novichok, which was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, England, in 2018."
More coronavirus falloutIndia surpassed Brazil in total cases, putting it in second place behind the United States for a dubious honor.
"India added 90,802 cases — a fresh global record in the pandemic — in the last 24 hours, pushing its total past 4.2 million. Only the United States, with 6.2 million cases, has recorded more. Brazil had 4.1 million cases as of Sunday evening," Joanna Slater and Niha Masih report . "More than 71,000 people in India have died of covid-19 … India's outbreak shows no sign of peaking. Since early August, India has been reporting the highest daily increases in cases in the world. … As the country has reopened, coronavirus cases have surged. Testing has also expanded significantly, although the number of tests remains low on a per capita basis compared to other countries."
Spain is experiencing a second wave. It became the first western European country to record half a million cases. Experts said they fear France and the U.K. will follow its rapid rise in new infections. ( Guardian )
New Zealanders mocked Trump's recent accusation that their nation was suffering a "big surge" in cases by sharing photos of star-dusted skies, dazzling sunsets and mountainous views under the hashtag "NZHellhole." Trump keeps saying New Zealand is experiencing a big surge, but the country recorded only six new cases yesterday. ( Jennifer Hassan )
States face dire fiscal crises if the federal government stays deadlocked on delivering aid.
"Alaska chopped resources for public broadcasting. New York City gutted a nascent composting program that could have kept tons of food waste out of landfills. New Jersey postponed property-tax relief payments. Prisoners in Florida will continue to swelter in their cells, because plans to air-condition its prisons are on hold. Many states have already cut planned raises for teachers. And that's just the start," the Times reports . "Across the nation, states and cities have made an array of fiscal maneuvers to stay solvent and are planning more … Economists warn that further state spending reductions could prolong the downturn by shaking the confidence of residents, whose day-to-day lives depend heavily on state and local services. … Collectively, state governments will have budget shortfalls of $312 billion through the summer of 2022, according to a review by Moody's Analytics. When local governments are factored in, the shortfall rises to $500 billion. That estimate assumes the pandemic doesn't get worse."
Parents are quitting their jobs to keep up with their kids’ online schooling, which will slow the recovery.
"According to research that Brevan Howard Asset Management recently shared with its investors, about 4.3 million U.S. workers could find themselves staying home unless they find other child-care arrangements. If those parents are counted among the unemployed, it would boost the unemployment rate by 2.6 percentage points," the Wall Street Journal reports . "That would be a sharper increase than occurred in both the 1990-91 and 2001 recessions, though smaller than what occurred in the 2007-09 downturn, the researchers said. A recent analysis by Barclays economist Jonathan Millar and colleagues found that the closures of all schools from September to December 2020 would result in a reduction of U.S. gross domestic product in 2020 on the order of between 0.4% and 0.8%. That compares with an inflation-adjusted GDP decline of 0.1% in 1991 and a slight increase in 2001."
Parties are upending plans at reopened colleges.
"More than 51,000 cases have been reported at more than 1,000 campuses. Some students have faced serious consequences for breaking the rules. Northeastern University in Massachusetts dismissed 11 students last week for violating safety precautions. New York University, Ohio State, Purdue and West Virginia University have all suspended students over violations of rules intended to curb the virus's spread on campus," the Times reports . "At the University of Michigan, a labor union representing graduate-student instructors and assistants said it would go on strike Tuesday over virus safety and other concerns. … A student group at the University of Kansas, where there are nearly 500 cases, is planning a 'strike' to push the university to move to remote learning, The Kansas City Star reported; this follows a similar 'sickout' last week at the University of Iowa."
A cluster of cases was linked to a fraternity party at the University of New Hampshire, CNN reports . Colleges in the D.C. area, including the University of Maryland at College Park, are ramping up suspensions of rule breakers, Fox Baltimore reports . Meanwhile, health experts in Texas criticized universities for not ramping up testing among students -- while student-athletes get tested three times a week, other students don't get tested anywhere near that, the Texas Tribune reports .
New York's infection rate has been below 1 percent for 30 straight days. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) encouraged residents to continue wearing masks, social distancing and hand-washing. New York was once the epicenter of the virus, reporting more than 11,500 new cases in a single day in May. But, on Sunday, New York reported 720 new infections. ( Lateshia Beachum )
Theme park attendance is still in freefall. Park operators who spent months installing hand sanitizing stations and figuring out how to disinfect roller coasters between each ride are finding that crowds are reluctant to return. To address smaller-than-hoped-for crowds, Disney and others will begin cutting hours and calling off seasonal events. ( AP )

Full text: with Tonya Riley
The Trump administration today unveiled a $1 billion initiative it says is focused on maintaining U.S. dominance as a global technology leader.
An influx of cash for research in quantum and artificial intelligence is designed to help build more powerful computers and other tools for processing information, which could accelerate research and other scientific developments –- a goal that has taken on new significance amid a global race to develop a vaccine and treatments for coronavirus.
The announcement is a shot across the bow in the broader tech race with China – and seems positioned to be a feather in Trump's cap during the week of the Republican National Convention.
Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and senior adviser who is speaking at the convention this week, credited Trump with this "defining achievement as we continue to shape and prepare this great Nation for excellence in the industries of the future."
A significant chunk of the funding — which includes $300 million in contributions from academia and industry — will go toward establishing new centers focused on research in quantum within five of the Department of Energy labs. The administration is also awarding $140 million toward seven National Science Foundation-led institutes focused on artificial intelligence, which will be housed at colleges including the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The investments will be deployed over the next five years.
China has made significant investments in these fields, raising questions about the United States's ability to retain its technological edge.
The Trump administration is not viewed as science friendly and has made major cuts to science research. But it has continued to prioritize quantum and artificial intelligence as a national security issue, as China names these fields as priorities in its own research initiatives.
However, the Trump administration's investment pales in comparison to the investments that China says it has made. The country announced a $10 billion investment in one of the largest quantum labs, and it has made some achievements in the field, such as the first quantum satellite. Academics however have questioned media reports about this and concluded the Chinese government isn't likely dramatically outspending the United States in artificial intelligence.
"As the 12 new Institutes demonstrate, the United States will continue to lead in AI and QIS thanks to an innovation ecosystem that is the envy of the world," U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios told me. "We will succeed because the federal government partners with private-sector and academic leaders from all across the country to accelerate foundational research and promote free-market innovation and commercialization."
An administration official said that today's announcement is just part of a broader research and development investment in these technologies. The person said the administration is on track to double its spending on quantum and artificial intelligence in two years.
The private sector in the United States has also been heavily investing in these technologies – with venture capitalists and large tech companies pouring billions into technology in the fields.
The research institutes will bring together government, academia and the private sector.
Several prominent tech companies – including IBM, Intel and Microsoft and startups – are participating in the initiative. Their involvement underscores the pressure on U.S. companies to also maintain a competitive edge over competitors around the world. There will be plans in place to transfer technologies from the center to industry.
IBM will be a partner in three of the five quantum centers at the Department of Energy labs. Dario Gil, director of IBM Research, told me the initiative is an "important development" and it was very positive that different companies, universities and the government were all coming together.
"I will continue to advocate that the aggregate level of investment increases in science and technology in general in the United States by the federal government," he said.

Our top tabsFirst Lady Melania Trump fired off against “mean and manipulative” social media at the convention.
She expressed sympathy with parents who are trying to navigate the digital world for their children.
"Just like me, I know many of you watch how mean and manipulative social media can be … I'm sure many of you are looking for answers — how to talk to your children about the downside of technology, " she said.
It was one of several jabs against tech companies during the second night of the convention.
Tiffany Trump also slammed the effects of social media on society.
" People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants, " she said.
"Rather than allowing Americans the right to form our own beliefs, this misinformation system keeps people mentally enslaved to the ideas they deem correct. This has fostered unnecessary fear and divisiveness among us. Why are so many in the media, in technology, even in our own government, so invested in promoting a biased and fabricated view?" she said.
Tiffany, the youngest Trump, is a recent graduate of Georgetown Law, where she was reportedly co-president of the Cyberlaw Society . She does not have an official White House role.
The RNC pulled one speaker for tweeting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories before the event began.
Mary Ann Mendoza, a member of the Women for Trump Campaign board, shared a thread of tweets promoting conspiracy theories about a Jewish plot to control the world, Colby Itkowitz reports.
"My apologies for not paying attention to the intent of the whole message. That does not reflect my feelings or personal thoughts whatsoever," Mendoza wrote after reporters picked up the tweets.
Mendoza had shared similar conspiracy theories about a wealthy Jewish family in the past. Mendoza had also previously been suspended from Twitter and from Facebook for posts violating standards on hate speech.
YouTube doubled its video removals during the pandemic.
Removals in the most sensitive categories – including violent extremism and content that could jeopardize child safety – nearly tripled, Protocol's Issie Lapowsky reports. The company attributed the increase to a more aggressive approach of "potential over-enforcement" and accepting a lower level of accuracy for removals flagged by its technology.
But comparing YouTube's results with Facebook, which also sent human moderators home in March, shows automated systems across the industry have room to improve.
Removals of child sexual abuse material fell in Facebook's second quarter. Conversely, Facebook saw more removals of hate speech than YouTube. YouTube said it maintained its appeals process to account for over-removals, whereas Facebook suspended it's for the most sensitive categories.
The comparison between the two social media giants isn't one to one. Each platform has slightly different definitions of categories.
"And yet, the two reports still illustrate an important point about how the covid-19 era has affected what people see — and don't — online," Issie writes. "Facebook and YouTube often get lumped together as two social networks filled with the same filth, both using a combination of AI and low-wage contractors to rid problematic posts from their platforms. But over the last six months, these two companies have taken two different approaches to the same problem, and they have yielded dramatically different outcomes."
Palantir included a loud message for critics in its filing to go public.
Chief executive Alex Karp took a jab at competitors who rely on selling and mining data and advertising for rebuking controversial government contracts, Ari Levy at CNBC reports.
"Software projects with our nation's defense and intelligence agencies, whose missions are to keep us safe, have become controversial, while companies built on advertising dollars are commonplace," Karp wrote in a letter in the filing. "The slogans and marketing of many of the Valley's largest technology firms attempt to obscure this simple fact."
Palantir, which was co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, has accrued more than $1.5 billion in federal contracts with agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Thiel was a prominent Trump supporter and member of Trump's transition team in 2016, but he has since reportedly distanced himself from the president.
Last year, the company had nearly $580 million in losses.
The filing also outlines Palantir's clear stance against working with China, saying it could hurt the company's growth long-term.
"We do not consider any sales opportunities with the Chinese communist party, do not host our platforms in China, and impose limitations on access to our platforms in China in order to protect our intellectual property, to promote respect for and defend privacy and civil liberties protections, and to promote data security," the filing says.
Lawmakers have slammed tech companies including Apple and Google for their relationships with China in the past.
The digital race to 2020The Trump campaign is using influencer-led attacks to drum up support from Black voters.
Speakers during the first night of the Republican National Convention took a more moderate tact than Black influencers online who have used extreme tactics to fight against the president's Black critics, Isaac Stanley-Becker reports.
Conservative commentators such as Candace Owens, who wields a network of Facebook pages, have popularized anti-Democratic sentiments like leaving the "Democratic plantation." The attacks against Democrats alleging the political suppression of Black Americans have grown more explicit since Kamala Harris, who is Black and Asian American, was named to the ticket.
A viral video from Kimberly Klacik, a Black Republican running for Congress in Maryland, who spoke on opening night, called Harris a prop. Conservative influencers and Trump supporters Diamond and Silk popularized a meme attacking Harris for marrying a white man. These attacks have spread beyond conservative online corners to more fringe groups as well, Isaac reports.
Having Black voices spread the message is key to spreading "misinformation and hate" as a legitimate critique of Democrats, said Andre Banks, a co-founder of Win Black/Pa'lante, a group combating disinformation targeting Black and Latino communities. "No White person," Banks said, could deliver similar messages without "experiencing harmful side effects."
Workforce reportGig worker activists are asking Instacart to provide relief to workers affected by natural disasters.
Workers are bringing demands in light of raging wildfires in California, Megan Rose Dickey at TechCrunch reports. Gig Workers Collective, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of workers at companies including Lyft and Instacart, is calling the delivery company to pay a disaster rate equal to average daily pay as long as operations are shut down. The group also wants Instacart to commit to shutting down operations in markets where a state of emergency or evacuation has been issued.

Full text: The U.S. first lady, Melania Trump, called Covid-19 an “invisible enemy” and acknowledged the pandemic’s human toll. Kim Jong-un acknowledged ‘shortcomings’ in North Korea’s fight against the virus.
This briefing has ended. Read live coronavirus updates here.
The C.D.C. changes testing guidelines to exclude those exposed to virus who don’t exhibit symptoms.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly modified its coronavirus testing guidelines this week to exclude people who do not have symptoms of Covid-19 — even if they have been recently exposed to the virus.
Experts questioned the revision, pointing to the importance of identifying infections in the brief window immediately before the onset of symptoms, when many individuals are thought to be most contagious.
Models suggest that about half of transmission events can be traced back to individuals still in the so-called pre-symptomatic stage, before they have started feeling ill — if they ever feel sick at all.
A more lax approach to testing, experts said, could delay crucial treatments, as well as obscure the coronavirus’s true spread in the community. Case numbers remain persistently high across much of the United States, though they have been falling in recent weeks, to an average of about 43,000 new cases a day from a peak of more than 66,000 a month ago. Many of the states that saw the largest outbreaks in early summer are now reporting sustained progress, including Arizona and Florida. But parts of the Midwest, as well as Hawaii and some U.S. territories, are still seeing increases in new cases.
“This is potentially dangerous,” said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician in Palo Alto, Calif. Restricting testing to only people with obvious symptoms of Covid-19 means “you’re not looking for a lot of people who are potential spreaders of disease,” she added. “I feel like this is going to make things worse.”
Prior iterations of the C.D.C.’s testing guidelines struck a markedly different tone, explicitly stating that “testing is recommended for all close contacts” of people infected with the coronavirus, regardless of symptoms. The agency also specifically emphasized “the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission” as an important factor in the spread of disease.
The C.D.C.’s newest version, which was posted on Monday, amended the agency’s guidance to say that people who have been in close contact with a person with the coronavirus — typically defined as being within 6 feet of that person for at least 15 minutes — “do not necessarily need a test” if they do not have symptoms. Exceptions, the agency noted, might be made for “vulnerable” individuals, or if health care providers or state or local public health officials recommend testing.
“Wow, that is a walk-back,” said Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of California’s Keck School of Medicine. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, and that’s a really big change.”
Dr. Butler-Wu said she’s concerned that the guidelines would be misinterpreted as implying that people without symptoms were unable to pass the coronavirus to others — a falsehood that experts have been trying for months to dispel.
The reason behind the shift in testing recommendations remains unclear. In response to an inquiry from The New York Times, a representative for the C.D.C. directed the questions to the Department of Health and Human Services. An H.H.S. spokesperson said that “the decision to be tested should be one made in collaboration with public health officials or your health care provider based on individual circumstances and the status of community spread.”
The Trump administration ordered hospitals to report data to H.H.S. or risk losing funding.
The Trump administration on Tuesday threatened hospitals with revoking their Medicare and Medicaid funding if they do not report coronavirus patient data and test results to the Department of Health and Human Services.
The threat was included in new emergency rules, announced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, that make mandatory what has until now been a voluntary program.
The new rules generated an immediate backlash from the American Hospital Association, which branded them a “heavy-handed regulatory approach” that was “announced in final form without consultation, or the opportunity to provide feedback.”
Rick Pollack, the association’s president and chief executive officer, called the changes “disturbing.”
“It’s beyond perplexing why CMS would use a regulatory sledgehammer — threatening Medicare participation — to the very organizations that are on the front lines in the fight against Covid-19,” Mr. Pollack said in a statement. “This rule should be reversed immediately.”
The rules come amid controversy over the current voluntary data reporting system. In July, the administration abruptly ordered hospitals to stop reporting coronavirus patient information to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and send results instead to a private vendor, Pittsburgh-based TeleTracking Technologies, which provides the data to H.H.S.
That move has raised concerns among public health experts and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who worry about scientific integrity and object to sidelining government experts.
Administration officials say the switch was necessary to improve reporting of testing data, and the rules issued Tuesday will give the administration an enforcement stick.
“Hospitals will face possible termination of Medicare and Medicaid payment if unable to correct reporting deficiencies,” Tuesday’s announcement states.
The hospital reporting requirement is part of what the centers described as “sweeping regulatory changes” intended to better track and combat the coronavirus pandemic. The new rules also require nursing homes to test staff and offer testing to residents for the virus.
The agency said it would soon announce guidance for the frequency of nursing home staff testing, which will be based on the degree of Covid-19 spread in individual communities.
Nursing homes are already required to offer tests to residents when there is an outbreak or other residents show symptoms. Like hospitals, nursing homes will face penalties for noncompliance. They will be inspected and those cited “may face enforcement sanctions” such as “civil money penalties in excess of $400 per day, or over $8,000 for an instance of noncompliance,” the announcement said.
“These new rules represent a dramatic acceleration of our efforts to track and control the spread of Covid-19,” Seema Verma, the administrator of the centers, said in a statement.
“Reporting of test results and other data are vitally important tools for controlling the spread of the virus and give providers on the front lines what they need to fight it.”
At the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump acknowledges the pandemic’s human toll.
In a speech that struck a strikingly different tone from others at the Republican National Convention, the first lady, Melania Trump, on Tuesday acknowledged the pandemic’s human toll and praised the efforts of front-line medical personnel and other essential workers.
In her speech from the Rose Garden at the White House, Mrs. Trump called Covid-19 an “invisible enemy” that had swept across the nation. She also extended her sympathies to those who were ill or who had lost loved ones.
“I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless,” she said. “I want you to know: You’re not alone. My husband’s administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone.”
“Donald will not rest until he has done all he can to take care of everyone impacted by this terrible pandemic,” she added.
So far, most of the convention speakers who mentioned the pandemic have referred to it in the past tense and rarely mentioned its national toll. As of Tuesday evening, more than 5.7 million people in the United States have been infected with the coronavirus and at least 178,300 have died, according to a New York Times database.
The tone of Mrs. Trump’s remarks also stood in contrast to her husband’s focus on defending his response to the virus and pinning the blame for it on China, while tending to mention the lives lost as an afterthought.
Mrs. Trump spoke moments after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a shorter and harsher speech, from a rooftop in Jerusalem, that was more in line with the president’s rhetoric on the pandemic. Mr. Pompeo, who is among the administration’s leading China hawks, argued that Mr. Trump had “pulled back the curtain on the predatory aggression of the Chinese Communist Party,” including its handling of the coronavirus.
“The president has held China accountable for covering up the China virus, and allowing it to spread death and destruction in America and around the world,” Mr. Pompeo said at one point. “And he will not rest until justice is done.”
Earlier in the night, Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser, boasted that President Trump had led an “extraordinary rescue” to “successfully fight the Covid virus” and save the U.S. economy. He failed to mention that the virus was still raging and glossed over the immense unemployment and economic pain that the crisis has created.
‘No second chances’: Colleges are coming down hard on students who violate virus restrictions.
As colleges and universities across the country grapple with rising coronavirus cases, they are increasingly disciplining newly returned students for violating pandemic safety rules, and pressuring fraternities and sororities to stop holding events that violate bans on partying.
At the Ohio State University, 228 students have received interim suspensions for violating rules against large gatherings during the pandemic, the university said on Tuesday. Most of the students were living off campus, and have been asked to remain away from campus until their cases have been adjudicated; some of the suspensions have already been reversed. Violators who live on campus could lose their university housing if their cases are deemed serious enough, the school said.
Montclair State University in New Jersey, which reopened its dorms this month and began classes Tuesday, said it had already suspended 11 students from living in university housing for gathering without masks or social distancing.
“Please understand, there will be no second chances,” school officials warned students in an email message sent over the weekend (not a text message, as an earlier version of this item said). “Any student who violates the safety protocols will be immediately suspended from housing (possibly for the remainder of the year), will be referred to the director of student conduct for disciplinary action and will be immediately de-registered from any courses or programs that have an on-campus component.”
Syracuse University suspended 23 students last week after a gathering on the campus quad that the dean of students decried as “incredibly reckless.” Thirty-six students were suspended by Purdue University after a party at a cooperative house. Penn State University suspended a fraternity for holding an unsanctioned social, and Drake University banned at least 14 students from campus for two weeks for partying.
In Florida, the president of the University of Miami, Julio Frenk, said the school had begun evicting students from dorms for violations, warning in a video that the university — which has had 141 cases since the start of the school year — would continue to monitor student behavior on and off campus.
Outbreaks have emerged at campuses across the country as students have streamed back for fall classes. Many have been linked to large gatherings that were held despite state, local and campus public health rules. Among the recent reports: 566 cases among students, faculty and staff at the University of Alabama, most of them on its Tuscaloosa campus, where classes resumed last week, and 43 new cases at the University of Southern California, which is holding online classes but giving students limited access to campus.
All told, The New York Times has identified more than 23,000 cases on 750 campuses since the coronavirus crisis began in the late winter and spring.

- To help improve poor ventilation in New York City’s aging public school buildings , the mayor said Tuesday that city inspectors would assess every classroom by Sept. 1. and not allow the inadequately ventilated ones to reopen. About 10,000 portable air filters will be installed in nurses’ offices, isolation rooms and other high-risk areas, he said. The powerful teachers’ union has demanded that the city update ventilation systems before the scheduled start of classes in a hybrid model on Sept. 10, but many principals and teachers say they do not believe the buildings will be ready by then and have urged the mayor to push the start of in-person reopening back a few weeks.



Kim Jong-un acknowledges ‘shortcomings’ in North Korea’s fight against Covid-19.
​ North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has urged his government to eliminate “shortcomings” and “​defects” in its battle against Covid-19 and to brace for a typhoon that is approaching the Korean Peninsula, state media reported on Wednesday.
Mr. Kim convened the ruling Workers’ Party’s Political Bureau and its Executive Policy Council on Tuesday, a week after making a rare admission that his five-year economic plan had faltered in the face of​ international sanctions, the coronavirus and recent flood damage.​ North Korea plans to hold a party congress in January to chart a new five-year economic plan.
​During this week’s meetings, Mr. Kim cited “facts about some shortcomings in state emergency anti-epidemic work” and ordered active measures “to overcome the defects urgently,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency reported on Wednesday, without elaborating.
North Korea has reported no coronavirus infections, but outside experts are skeptical, citing the country’s decrepit public health system and its proximity to China, where the virus was first detected.
Last week, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers in Seoul that the North’s fear of the virus had deepened since July, forcing the authorities to tighten travel in and out of Pyongyang, the North’s capital, and western and southern provinces.
The South Korean spy agency also said that the North’s foreign currency reserves had diminished as United Nations sanctions and the pandemic slashed its exports to China, its main trading partner, according to lawmakers who were briefed by the agency. Budget constraints have so far forced Mr. Kim to scale back his construction projects and reduce his military’s summer field exercises by up to 65 percent, they said.
Another strain on the North’s economy has been an unusually long monsoon season that caused extensive damage to farmland earlier this month. A fresh storm, Typhoon Bavi, is now expected to hit later this week, raising fears that back-to-back natural disasters could wreak further economic havoc.
The United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service estimated this month that about six in ten North Koreans are food-insecure in 2020.
On Tuesday, Mr. Kim urged his government to “thoroughly prevent the casualties by typhoon and minimize the damage to the crops,” saying that the typhoon will decide “whether we would successfully wrap up this year’s farming or not.”
Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, ruled through his inner circles, but his son has convened party meetings more frequently, in an apparent attempt to make his government look more transparent. So far this year, the party’s Political Bureau has met seven times.
“The situation in North Korea must be dire for Kim Jong-un to hold so many high-level conferences,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “The party does not want to appear flat-footed and will take credit if a crisis is averted.”
Jail time or a $569,000 fine: The price of breaking quarantine can be steep.
As countries work to contain fresh coronavirus outbreaks, some are making good on threats of heavy fines and even jail time for those who breach quarantine rules or border restrictions.
In the latest example, a Kentucky man accused of breaking Canadian quarantine rules faces six months in prison, a $569,000 fine or perhaps both.
The man, John Pennington, was fined about $900 by the police in late June, after staff members at an Alberta hotel grew suspicious that he was breaking the province’s quarantine rules. The police later charged him with doing just that, after finding him at Sulphur Mountain, a tourist attraction.
Though the Canadian border is closed to the United States, a loophole allows Americans to travel to and from Alaska, providing they use a direct route, quarantine at hotels and refrain from visiting national parks, leisure sites or tourist attractions.
Separately, a 28-year-old woman in Australia was sentenced to six months in jail on Tuesday after she hid in the back of a truck on a cross-country journey of more than 1,800 miles from the state of Victoria, a coronavirus hot spot, to Western Australia. The police said that she was picked up by her partner at a gas station.
The woman had traveled to Victoria to care for her sister and had received an exemption to fly back to Western Australia, which has closed its borders to travelers, her lawyer told a court. But the exemption did not apply to travel by road, and she pleaded guilty to breaking the order.
Western Australia’s pandemic rules include a 14-day mandatory quarantine for most travelers in a hotel, and the penalties for breaking them range from prison terms as long as 12 months to as much as $35,000 in fines.
Australia has had 549 deaths and more than 25,000 confirmed cases as of Wednesday, according to a Times database. Many of its state borders are closed because of the recent outbreak in Victoria, where the state capital, Melbourne, remains under lockdown.
Victoria’s latest outbreak has been linked to breaches in a quarantine hotel, but people around the country have been trying to circumvent virus-related restrictions anyway.
Last month, four men in their 20s were found hiding on an interstate freight train heading from Melbourne to Perth, on the country’s west coast. The police have also issued citations to travelers from hot spots like Sydney for lying on border declaration forms.
Two more cases of reinfection were reported, this time in Europe.
Two more cases of reinfection with the coronavirus were reported in Europe on Tuesday, a day after a 33-year-old man in Hong Kong was confirmed to have been infected a second time.
In all three cases, researchers compared genetic material from both rounds of infection and confirmed that the patients were not just carrying remnants of dead virus left over from the first illness.
The new cases were announced by European researchers. The data have not been published in any form as yet.
Experts told The Times on Monday that reinfections with the virus are not surprising, though not believed to be common. As with most other respiratory viruses, including common-cold coronaviruses and influenza, one bout with the new coronavirus may provoke an immune response that may not prevent a second infection — but nonetheless is likely to mute symptoms the second time around.
One new reinfection case was an older person in the Netherlands with a weakened immune system, researchers said. The other patient, in Belgium, was a woman who had only mild symptoms in March and became infected again in June.
The man in Hong Kong, too, had only mild symptoms and did not develop detectable antibodies after the first infection. Even so, he had no symptoms at all the second time and his case was found only by routine screening at an airport. His case suggests that even people who did not produce a strong antibody response to an initial case may be protected from becoming seriously ill if exposed to the virus again, experts have said.
Some news reports have speculated that the cases raise questions about the effectiveness of vaccines for preventing coronavirus infection. But experts have said the opposite: Vaccines can be designed to elicit immunity that’s stronger and longer lasting than that resulting from natural infection.
“In order to provide herd immunity, a potent vaccine is needed to induce immunity that prevents both reinfection and disease,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, told The Times on Monday.
In other news from around the world:

- In South Korea , doctors in the Seoul metropolitan area on Wednesday began a three-day strike over government plans to increase the number of medical students by 4,000 over the next decade. The government says that the growth would help the country deal with crises like the coronavirus pandemic, but doctors argue that they are already operating in a cutthroat competition — and that the government should offer financial incentives for young doctors to open shop in rural areas. President Moon Jae-in on Wednesday ordered his government to “deal sternly with” the doctors on strike through a “principled enforcement of law.”

- As Hong Kong on Tuesday announced plans to begin easing its social-distancing rules, the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, said that criticism by health experts of a new, Beijing-backed coronavirus testing program was a “politically calculated” effort to smear the Chinese government. Some of those experts say the plan is a waste of resources, while activists fear it could lead to the harvesting of DNA samples for China’s surveillance apparatus, accusations that local officials deny.

- The Chinese government has imposed a sweeping lockdown across the Xinjiang region in western China , penning in millions of people as part of what officials describe as an effort to fight a resurgence of the coronavirus. But many residents accuse the government of acting too harshly, reviving concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government has spent years perfecting a system of mass surveillance and control in the region and has long imposed draconian social rules on the region’s largely Muslim ethnic minority groups, who make up about half the population.

- Two Irish political leaders have resigned after a furor, now known as “GolfGate,” over their attendance at a dinner organized by the Golf Society of the country’s legislature. The gathering took place a day after the government tightened coronavirus restrictions to combat a spike in infections, and has sparked a backlash that has also threatened the jobs of other public figures, including the European Union’s trade commissioner, Phil Hogan.

- Uganda has recalled its ambassador to Denmark as well as her deputy after allegations that they were plotting to steal funds allocated to deal with the pandemic. The ambassador, Nimisha Madhvani, and her deputy, Elly Kamahungye, were recorded devising ways to share the money along with other embassy staff members. Uganda’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the allegations “grave” and said it would carry out a “thorough investigation” into the matter.



Protesters against virus restrictions pour into the Idaho State Capitol.
Conservative protesters flooded the Idaho State Capitol in Boise this week, many of them without wearing masks, to express anger and frustration during a special legislative session called to address voting and liability laws amid the pandemic.
Among the protesters was Ammon Bundy, once the leader of an armed takeover of an Oregon wildlife refuge, who was arrested by Idaho State Police along with two other people for trespassing Tuesday amid protests over coronavirus regulations.
The discontent in Idaho reflects a strong libertarian streak in the rural West. Mr. Bundy and others, including some Idaho public officials, have complained for months about the efforts of state leaders like Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, to rein in the spread of the virus with stay-at-home orders and restrictions on businesses.
“The Idaho people are more than capable of keeping themselves safe,” Mr. Bundy told lawmakers on Monday, according to a report in The Idaho Press. “They are more than capable of driving the greatest economy that any state has enjoyed.”
On Tuesday Mr. Bundy and two others refused to leave an auditorium at the Idaho state capital, long after the hearing had finished, according to a spokeswoman for the Idaho State Police. Mr. Bundy refused to stand so police handcuffed him and wheeled him out in a chair, she said. Early in the afternoon Mr. Bundy told the Idaho Press he was going to remain seated in protest of the removal of “citizen journalists” from a hearing; at least one worked for a libertarian organization.
On Monday police also scuffled with protesters, who shattered a glass door at the State Capitol according to The Idaho Statesman.
Idaho, like many states, saw a sharp increase in new coronavirus cases starting around mid-June. Daily reports of new cases have receded a bit since then, but remain much higher than the figures reported in the spring.
Elsewhere in the United States:

- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Tuesday that New York will now require travelers from Guam to quarantine for 14 days, an addition to a list of 28 states as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. New Jersey also said travelers from those 31 places were subject to a 14-day quarantine, though the state has said compliance is voluntary but expected. Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Maryland and Montana were removed in the weekly update.

- In New York City , Sheriff Joseph Fucito on Tuesday said officials are considering boarding long-haul buses before passengers disembark at bus terminals, as part of a move by the city to promote compliance with the state’s 14-day quarantine requirement for many travelers. In an interview, Mr. Fucito said officials would randomly target buses whose public schedules indicate they are coming from places on the state’s list. Upon the buses’ arrival, but before passengers can offload, officials would board the bus and ask riders to fill out the state’s required travel form with their contact information and quarantine plans.

- American Airlines plans to furlough 19,000 employees this fall when restrictions on job cuts that airlines agreed to in exchange for federal aid end on Oct. 1. This brings the total number of employees cut to 40,000 when combined with employees who have taken buyouts or agreed to long-term leave. In a letter to employees, the top two executives blamed Congress for not providing enough aid to the airline industry.

- American Airlines also received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency to use a new cleaning spray on its planes that purports to kill coronaviruses on surfaces for up to seven days. The agency described the product, Allied BioScience’s SurfaceWise2 , as groundbreaking and a “first-ever long-lasting antiviral product.” American said it would start using SurfaceWise2 in the coming months.

- Mississippi reported 67 new deaths and Montana reported 6 new fatalities, each setting single-day state records.

- Miami-Dade County, Fla., which has been hit hard by the virus, will allow indoor restaurant dining starting Monday, Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Tuesday. The decision was made after consulting with restaurant owners, the White House coronavirus task force and local medical experts, he said. The county’s positivity rate has been just under 10 percent for about a week, which is still higher than the 5 percent that Mr. Gimenez had said would be the target for more widespread reopening. Restaurant capacity will be capped at 50 percent, with no more than six people at a table. Tables will be spaced, doors must be kept open — windows too, if possible — and the air-conditioning must run all the time. Masks will be required for diners until they are served water and any time they get up from the table. Mr. Gimenez also said he does not plan to close beaches for Labor Day, as the county did for the Fourth of July. His administration plans to deploy more personnel to enforce coronavirus rules on the beaches and elsewhere in the county during the holiday weekend, he said. (An earlier version of this item misidentified the approaching holiday as Memorial Day.)

- Most children born in New Jersey would be entitled to a $1,000 state-financed nest egg under a proposal that Gov. Philip D. Murphy said Tuesday could narrow a widening wealth gap in the U.S., where the average white family has seven times the wealth of the average Black family. The move would be a small but tangible step, the governor said, toward confronting inequities that have been brought into particularly stark relief by the pandemic: Black and Latino people have died and lost jobs at far higher rates than white people. The State Legislature recently approved nearly $10 billion in bond debt to cover the extraordinary costs created by the pandemic and a related drop in tax revenue.
Mr. Murphy, who is again proposing a so-called millionaire’s tax, said the baby-bond initiative would be coupled with $1.2 billion in cuts across state agencies. He also proposed raising cigarette taxes to $4.35 a pack, the highest in the nation; and increasing sales taxes on boats, yachts and firearms, among other measures.

- Given the complexity of state tax laws , accountants are advising their clients to track the number of days they spend working out of state. Some states impose income tax on people who work there for as little as a single day.



A February conference in Boston led to the infection of tens of thousands around the world, a study shows.
Scientists have found that a conference in Boston in late February triggered a gigantic spread of the virus. It ultimately may have led to the infection of tens of thousands of people both in the United States and abroad.
The finding emerged from a large study of the outbreak in the Boston area, which the authors posted online on Tuesday but has not yet been published in a scientific journal.
Researchers at the Broad Institute of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology analyzed the genomes of coronavirus samples taken from 772 people diagnosed with Covid-19 between January and May. They collected the virus from samples taken at hospitals, nursing homes, homeless shelters and other locations in the Boston area.
The researchers found, by analyzing variations in samples of the coronavirus, that it was introduced more than 80 times to the region — mostly from Europe, and coming either directly to Boston or indirectly through other parts of the northeastern United States. Most of these introductions petered out without much spread.
But a conference hosted by the biotech company Biogen on Feb. 26 and 27 fueled the spread of one strain of the virus, which soon became very common around Boston. The researchers were able to trace it later to other states and to countries such as Singapore and Australia.
Dr. Jacob Lemieux, the first author of the study and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in an interview that it was just a matter of bad luck that someone with the virus spent time in a place that could promote its spread — and that the infected people promptly boarded airplanes to spread the virus further.
“It’s the play of chance,” said Dr. Lemieux. “If it hadn’t been this conference, it would have been another event.”
Send children to school? Democrats are more reluctant than Republicans, a survey finds.
Parents as a whole are stressed and anxious about the virus and the school year. But there’s a large political divide, a new survey for The New York Times shows. Democrats are more reluctant to send their children to school than Republicans are, and are more worried about their families becoming infected.
Republicans are also more likely to say teachers should work in person, according to the survey, which was administered by Morning Consult to a nationally representative sample of 1,081 parents from Aug. 4 to Aug. 8.
President Trump made school reopenings a contentious issue when, in July, he demanded that schools open, even as cases were rising. It ended up alienating many teachers and parents, who said he wasn’t doing what was necessary to reopen safely. But it did not turn away his loyal supporters, the new data indicates.
When parents who approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing were asked whether they had considered keeping their child home from school for health and safety reasons, even if it reopened, 29 percent said they had considered it. Among parents who disapprove of Mr. Trump, 45 percent considered keeping their children home.
There was a similar divide when parents were asked whether teachers should be expected to return to school in person — a question that has catalyzed teachers’ unions and in some cases, divided teachers, administrators and parents. Over all, one-quarter of parents said teachers should be strongly encouraged to return, two-thirds said they should be able to do their jobs virtually, and the rest weren’t sure.
Republican parents were nearly three times as likely as Democrats to say teachers should be considered essential workers who needed to return to school. Thirty-six percent of Republicans said that, compared with 13 percent of Democrats.
Flu-season testing delays in the U.S. could make it easier for the virus to spread undetected.
Come fall, the rise of influenza and other seasonal respiratory infections could exacerbate already staggering delays in coronavirus testing, making it easier for the virus to spread unnoticed, experts said.
In typical years, doctors often don’t test for flu, simply assuming that patients with coughs, fevers and fatigue during the winter months are probably carrying the highly infectious virus. But this year, with the coronavirus bringing similar symptoms, doctors will need to test for both viruses to diagnose their patients, further straining supply shortages.
Testing for individual viruses poses many challenges for doctors and laboratory workers already fighting their way through supply shortages. Several of these tests use similar machines and chemicals, and require handling and processing by trained personnel.
Some manufacturers have begun making tests that can screen for several pathogens at once. But these combo tests are expensive and will likely make up only a small fraction of the market.
“The flu season is a bit of a ticking time bomb,” said Amanda Harrington, the medical director of microbiology at Loyola University Medical Center. “We are all waiting and trying to prepare as best we can.”
Flu viruses and coronaviruses differ in many ways, including how they spread, how long they linger in the body and the groups they affect most severely. Food and Drug Administration-approved antivirals and vaccines exist for the flu, but no such treatments exist for the coronavirus, which has killed at least 812,000 people worldwide in less than a year, according to a Times database.
Being infected with one virus doesn’t preclude contracting the other. And researchers also don’t yet know how risky it is for a person to harbor both viruses at the same time.
Those differences make it essential to tease the two pathogens apart, as well as to rule out other common winter infections like respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V., which hits the very young and very old especially hard.
But many flu and R.S.V. tests vanished from the market this spring as the companies that make them rapidly pivoted to address the coronavirus.
After a sharp case rise in Danbury, Conn., the mayor says ‘we want to make sure that we can slow the spread.’
Facing an uptick in cases, the city of Danbury, Conn., has closed public boat launches to prevent the spread of the virus among boaters on a popular lake, Mayor Mark Boughton said on Tuesday.
Connecticut has also closed a boat ramp it operates nearby, in an effort to curb parties held on the water or in nearby parking lots, Gov. Ned Lamont said at a news conference with the mayor.
“We want to make sure that we can slow the spread,” Mr. Boughton said.
On Friday, officials in Connecticut issued a public health warning for Danbury, a city of about 84,000 people near the New York border, that urged residents to stay home when possible and limit gatherings. The move came after 178 new cases were reported in the city in the first 20 days of August, more than quadruple the figure for the prior two weeks.
In response, Danbury’s public schools will reopen with remote learning on Sept. 8 and will re-evaluate on Oct. 1 whether to allow some in-person learning.
So far, public health officials have linked the cases to domestic and international travel, live services held at places of worship and contact on athletic fields, Mr. Boughton said. They also remained concerned over large family gatherings. As of Tuesday, travelers to Connecticut are now required to quarantine for 14 days if they are coming from Guam, as well as dozens of states and two other territories.
Mr. Lamont said that the uptick had not spread to parts of Connecticut beyond Danbury.
A state legislator, David Arconti, said that cases appeared to have risen in neighborhoods of Danbury that lost power for days after Tropical Storm Isaias ripped through the New York region. He and other officials were exploring a possible connection, he said.
Mr. Lamont said the state would monitor other municipalities that had been hard hit by power outages to see if they saw an uptick similar to Danbury’s.
A U.K. program splits the check with patrons in restaurants, but it might not be enough to save the industry.
When the British government told people they no longer had to stay home, it needed a convincing pitch to get everyone back outside and, crucially, spending money — especially in restaurants.
The answer: half-price food. For the month of August, the government has been paying for a 50 percent discount on all meals eaten in restaurants, pubs or cafes, up to 10 pounds ($13) per person, on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
It’s a discount that Britons have taken up with relish.
In the first three weeks of the program, 64 million meals — enough for nearly the entire British population of about 67 million — were eaten using the discount, costing the government £336 million ($441 million).
On the first day, Aug. 3, food sales rose 100 percent compared with the previous Monday, according to CGA, a consultancy firm.
But restaurant industry workers worry whether a temporary discount can trigger a sustainable recovery. If diners retreat back to their homes once it’s too cold to dine outdoors or unemployment rises as the furlough program ends in October, what then?
After spending months warning of the dangers of indoor public spaces, the government now has to persuade people that it’s safe to return to their previous habits. Even if the customers want to keep coming back, restaurants face a lot of uncertainty.
Although new daily cases have been declining, with a seven-day average of 1,060 as of Monday, the economy in Britain fared worse than any other in Europe during the second quarter of the year, because of a longer lockdown period and heavy reliance on consumer spending.
Half of Britain’s restaurants are still closed and across the hospitality industry, businesses that are open are making only about 70 percent of their pre-pandemic revenue.
And while the program can help change consumer behavior, it doesn’t address how each establishment will make up for reduced capacity because of social distancing measures, or what will happen when it’s too cold to dine outside.
“Obviously, we don’t live in California or Dubai, we live in the U.K.,” said David Williams, co-owner of Baltic Market, a collection of street food and drinks vendors in Liverpool. “So there’s a finite amount of time that you want to eat a bowl of pasta outside.”
At the Republican convention, Trump and his allies engage in revisionism on the virus.
President Trump and his political allies mounted a fierce and misleading defense of his political record on the first night of the Republican convention on Monday, while unleashing a barrage of attacks on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Democratic Party that were unrelenting in their bleakness.
Hours after Republican delegates formally nominated Mr. Trump for a second term, the president and his party made plain that they intended to engage in sweeping revisionism about Mr. Trump’s management of the coronavirus pandemic, his record on race relations and much else.
A team of New York Times reporters followed the developments and fact-checked the speakers, providing context and explanation.
At times, the speakers and prerecorded videos appeared to be describing an alternate reality: one in which the nation was not nearing 180,000 deaths from the coronavirus; in which Mr. Trump had not consistently ignored serious warnings about the disease; and in which someone other than Mr. Trump had presided over an economy that began crumbling in the spring.
Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, praised his father’s management of the pandemic in one of several segments asserting an unsupported narrative that the president had been a sturdy leader in a crisis even as polls show Americans believe he has handled the pandemic poorly.
“As the virus began to spread, the president acted quickly and ensured ventilators got to hospitals that needed them most,” the president’s son said, making no mention of the millions of Americans sickened and killed or the complaints from governors that they were not receiving the necessary equipment. “There is more work to do, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.”
Another defense of Mr. Trump’s management of the pandemic took the form of a video that criticized the news media, Democrats and the World Health Organization, and presented a greatly distorted version of Mr. Trump’s record, casting him as a decisive leader against Democrats who had minimized the threat of the disease. The video featured three clips of Democratic governors, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, praising Mr. Trump in the spring, when state executives were pleading with the federal government for help and taking exceptional pains to stay on the president’s good side.
Mr. Trump’s first appearance in the evening program came in a brief segment that showed him at the White House interacting with frontline workers, who related their experiences in the health crisis. Mr. Trump largely deferred to the other speakers and prompted them to make comments — “Please, go ahead,” he said repeatedly — though he interjected his own commentary about the drug hydroxychloroquine, which the president had promoted aggressively as a remedy for the coronavirus despite no consensus among doctors that it was effective.
Here’s how Spain has become a new virus hot spot.
Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain announced on Tuesday that at least 2,000 troops could be deployed to track local coronavirus outbreaks, as the country faces one of Europe’s largest surges in infections in recent days.
In Tuesday’s edition of the Morning newsletter, David Leonhardt examined how Spain has, like the United States, become one of the few rich countries suffering a major outbreak. He writes:
Adjusted for population, Spain’s outbreak has even surpassed the U.S. outbreak over the last few days. How has it happened? Health experts are still trying to figure that out. But some of the early answers may sound familiar to Americans.
Lack of a clear national message. Spain’s prime minister — Pedro Sánchez, of the Socialist Workers’ Party — has not promoted medical disinformation, as President Trump has. Yet Sánchez has recently handed back control of virus policy to regional governments, instead of continuing to provide clear leadership about how people should behave.
Premature reopening. Spanish officials, like their American counterparts, made the mistake of thinking they could help the economy by prioritizing it over public health. Bars and nightclubs reopened. British tourists — a major source of revenue — were allowed to travel to Spain without restriction.
In truth, the only way to help the economy is to control the virus.
Not enough testing and contact tracing. The shortages have made it “difficult for health authorities to identify and isolate potential virus carriers,” according to The Wall Street Journal.
As I’ve written before, there is a set of consistent lessons from around the world about how to beat back the virus: Mass testing. Rapid quarantines, contact tracing and, when necessary, lockdowns. Limited social gatherings, especially indoors. Widespread mask wearing.
After taking these steps, many countries, including Canada, Australia and much of Europe and Asia, have the virus under control. Spain itself followed this strategy in the spring and also sharply reduced new cases (as you can see in the chart above) — before lifting its state of emergency on June 21 and reopening less carefully than its neighbors.
Since then, it has joined the U.S. as a classic exception that proves the rule.
The University of Alabama reported hundreds of cases of the virus after classes resumed last week.
Two colleges where classes have started said they had identified new cases among students. Officials at the University of Alabama said that 531 cases had been identified among students, faculty and staff on its Tuscaloosa campus since classes resumed Wednesday. The university, which is holding in-person classes, said that other campuses in its system had reported a total of 35 cases over the same period. The mayor of Tuscaloosa ordered the city’s bars to close for two weeks to help tamp down the outbreak.
The virus has been on the rise in Tuscaloosa. Over the last seven days, the state has reported an average of 36 new cases a day per 100,000 people, according to a New York Times database. Statewide, cases have been decreasing after a spike earlier this summer.
The University of Southern California, which is holding online classes but giving students limited access to campus, said it had identified 43 new cases in the past week, all of them related to “off-campus living environments.” The university, where classes began Aug. 17, called it “an alarming increase” and said that more than 100 students were under a two-week quarantine because of exposure to the virus. It warned students that “every surface, every interaction where you share close contact or remove your face covering, can pose a risk to yourself and your friends.”
Feel the urge to scream? Maybe these zombies can help.
Many people feel trapped by the coronavirus pandemic. In Japan, some are distracting themselves by screaming inside closed caskets.
During 15-minute shows performed in Tokyo over the weekend, thrill seekers shrieked and trembled in glass caskets as they listened to ghost stories and the roar of chain saws. With nowhere to run, they were menaced by zombies, poked with rubber hands and splashed with water, all for less than $10 in admission.
The event was organized by Kowagarasetai, a horror event production company whose name means “Scare Squad.” But some customers said they actually left feeling more relaxed.
The coffins are a better place to scream than at Japanese theme parks, which have encouraged visitors to keep their mouths shut on roller coasters to prevent virus transmission through droplets. (“Please scream inside your heart,” the Fuji-Q Highland amusement park suggested in June in a video demonstration by two of its executives, who inspired social media users to try the “serious face challenge” on their own roller coaster rides.)
Kenta Iwana, founder of Kowagarasetai, said he wanted to give people a way to express themselves without holding back.
“There are no places to scream,” Mr. Iwana, 25, told Agence France-Presse this summer as he introduced another one of his socially distanced productions, a drive-in haunted house. In addition to providing people with an emotional outlet, he said, his company creates job opportunities for performers who normally work at theme parks.
Japan, which has been fighting a resurgence of the virus in recent weeks, reported 740 new cases nationwide on Sunday, including 212 in Tokyo.

Full text: with Mariana Alfaro
WILMINGTON, Del. – Ridiculed by classmates and even mocked by a nun at his parochial school, a young Joe Biden stood alone in front of the mirror in his bedroom and recited poetry as a tool to conquer his stutter.
At 77, he still remembers passages like this one from Ralph Waldo Emerson: "Meek young men grow up in libraries, believing it their duty to accept the views, which Cicero, which Locke, which Bacon, have given, forgetful that Cicero, Locke, and Bacon were only young men in libraries, when they wrote these books."
On Thursday night, standing in an austere ballroom with just a few journalists, aides and Secret Service agents, Biden accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for president of the United States. The house where he would repeat those poems over and over again was just a few miles away, but he had traveled incalculable distances to arrive onstage in the Chase Center. Naturally, he concluded with a poem.
Biden's speech was well received, but maybe the most memorable moment from the fourth and final night of the party's convention was a prerecorded video by 13-year-old Brayden Harrington.
On Feb. 4, Biden met him on the rope line after a campaign rally in Concord, N.H. The former vice president had just finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses and, a week later, would finish in fifth place, with 8 percent, in the New Hampshire primary. Biden's third bid for the presidency was on life support, and few Americans were paying close attention to the mysterious new coronavirus that had locked down Wuhan, China.
When Brayden grew emotional as he explained that he has a stutter, Biden invited him backstage that day to talk more. He told him about reading poetry in the mirror and mentioned a book of poems by W.B. Yeats that he had found particularly helpful. On Thursday night, holding up a copy of the speech he was reading from his own bedroom, Brayden said Biden also showed him how he marks up his addresses to make them easier to read aloud.
"Without Joe Biden, I wouldn't be talking to you today," he said, fighting to produce several words but keeping his composure. "I'm just a regular kid. … Joe Biden cared."
Joe Biden cares. That was the central message of the final night of the convention. Democrats hope voters see Biden's empathy as a central contrast in his challenge against President Trump.
Former New York governor Mario Cuomo (D) said you campaign in poetry and govern in prose. This unconventional convention was all about poetry. There was far more emphasis on personality than policy. Organizers focused less on tossing red meat to the liberal base than featuring character references to show voters that their standard-bearer is a decent man who has integrity, heart and empathy.
Biden never uttered Trump's name as he described a "perfect storm" of four crises facing the country: a pandemic, recession, systemic racism and climate change. Speaking about young people agitating for government to do more about climate change, racial injustice and gun violence, Biden said: "I hear their voices and if you listen, you can hear them, too."
In February 2018, after a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., Trump held a listening session at the White House with victims of gun violence. An aide had jotted down this talking point on a note card that the president held in his hands during the 70-minute event: "I hear you."
Without mentioning that episode, Biden made clear in his acceptance speech that, if he is elected, staffers won't need to remind him. "My Dad was an honorable, decent man," Biden said. "He used to say, 'Joey, I don't expect the government to solve my problems, but I expect it to understand them.'"
He argued that character, compassion and decency – not just his name – will be on the ballot in November. "The current president has cloaked America in darkness for much too long. Too much anger. Too much fear. Too much division," Biden declared. "Here and now, I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I will be an ally of the light, not the darkness."
If former president Barack Obama's speech on Wednesday night was a warning that democracy itself is in danger, Biden's closing speech was about reassuring Americans that perseverance is possible and recovery is in reach. Biden noted that Franklin Roosevelt, who was president when he was born, faced another virus – polio – and endured. "And we will, too," he said.
Biden didn't just overcome his stutter. He was sworn into the Senate shortly after his first wife and daughter died in 1972, and he faced another crushing loss when his son, Beau, died of brain cancer in 2015 at 46. He has been tempered and defined by loss. His life serves as a testament to resiliency.
"In Joe Biden, you have a human being who is empathetic, who is honest [and] who is decent," said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). "At this particular moment in American history, my God, that is something that this country absolutely needs."
Sanders made that comment during a pre-taped discussion with other former Biden rivals from the primaries. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) recounted how Biden once called her cellphone to compliment her as she walked off the Senate floor late one night after delivering a speech to an empty chamber. Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) remembered how Biden pulled him aside before an Iowa steak fry to tell him that someone working on his campaign had experienced some family trauma.
Another video clip that played near the start of the two-hour program, about the influence of Biden's Catholicism, showed the candidate quoting Soren Kierkegaard, as he often does on the stump. "Faith sees best in the dark," the Danish philosopher said.
Biden said Obama, his former running mate, was the kind of president people "could and did look up to" as a role model. "No one's going to say that about the current occupant of the White House," Biden said. "If he's given four more years, he'll be what he's been for the last four years. … He'll wake up every day believing the job is all about him, never about you." Then the challenger asked a rhetorical question: "Is that the America you want for you, your children, your family?"
This 25-minute speech was the shortest acceptance speech in modern times. Partly, this was because there was no audience to applaud or cheer. Partly, it was because he did not beat around the bush.
Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, and their spouses went outside the arena afterward. They watched a fireworks show in lieu of the traditional balloon drop. Supporters, who had parked like they had come for a drive-in movie, honked approval from their cars.
Biden closed on an optimistic note, with one of his favorite passages from the Irish poet Seamus Heaney's "The Cure at Troy":
" History says, Don't hope
On this side of the grave,
But then, once in a lifetime
The longed-for tidal wave
Of justice can rise up
And hope and history rhyme. "
Heaney adapted this in 1991 from the Sophocles play, "Philoctetes," which is about the end of the Trojan War. It was intended to say something about the Troubles in Northern Ireland that he had lived through. The stanza that immediately follows the line Biden quoted is this:
" So hope for a great sea-change
On the far side of revenge.
Believe that further shore
Is reachable from here."
More on the electionsThe Washington Post’s Editorial Board is about to do something it has never done.
A series of in-depth editorials will lay out the harm that the board believes the incumbent president has caused and the destruction they fear he could cause if he secures a second term. The first installment of the series, called "Our democracy in peril," will get a big splash in Sunday's newspaper as a preview of next week's Republican convention. Read it here first:
"Trump will make this argument to the American people: Things were great until China loosed the novel coronavirus on the world. If you reelect me, I will make things great again. … But beyond the low unemployment rate he gained and lost, history will record Mr. Trump's presidency as a march of wanton, uninterrupted, tragic destruction. America's standing in the world, loyalty to allies, commitment to democratic values, constitutional checks and balances, faith in reason and science, concern for Earth's health, respect for public service, belief in civility and honest debate, beacon to refugees in need, aspirations to equality and diversity and basic decency — Mr. Trump torched them all. … The capitulation of the Republican Party has been nauseating. Misbehavior that many people vowed never to accept as normal has become routine. A second term might injure the experiment beyond recovery."
Quote of the day
"Biden goes to church so regularly that he doesn't even need tear gas," said actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, emceeing the convention, a reference to Trump's Bible photo op in Lafayette Square.

Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and money laundering.
Bannon was taken into custody off the coast of Westbrook, Conn., while aboard a 150-foot yacht called the Lady May owned by Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, who was once close with that country's intelligence service but is now wanted by Beijing authorities on charges of fraud, blackmail and bribery. A judge allowed the former Breitbart News chairman to be released on $5 million bond, secured by $1.75 million in assets. With the indictment of Bannon, prosecutors have now brought criminal charges against more than half a dozen people who worked for Trump's campaign or his administration or advised him personally. Those who have been convicted or pleaded guilty to federal crimes include Trump's former campaign chairman, his deputy campaign chairman, his former personal attorney and his former national security adviser.
"In a 23-page indictment, prosecutors said Bannon and another organizer, Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, lied when they claimed they would not take any compensation as part of the campaign, called 'We Build the Wall.' Bannon, prosecutors alleged, received more than $1 million through a nonprofit entity he controlled, sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to Kolfage while keeping a 'substantial portion' for himself," Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey, Rosalind Helderman and Shayna Jacobs report. "Bannon emerged from the federal courthouse in Manhattan, taking off his mask and smiling at a bank of television cameras. 'This entire fiasco is to stop people who want to build the wall,' he said. … Trump said he felt 'very badly' but asserted of Bannon, 'I haven't been dealing with him for a very long period of time.' Trump said he felt the private fundraising effort was 'something I very much thought was inappropriate to be doing.' 'I don't like that project,' the president said. 'I thought it was being done for showboating reasons.' …
" Those involved in the project had close ties to the administration, and campaign memorabilia was often pictured on the privately built section of the border wall. Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. was a guest at a symposium hosted by the We Build the Wall group in New Mexico in 2019, praising the organization as 'private enterprise at its finest.' 'Doing it better, faster, cheaper than anything else,' he added, in comments the group highlighted on its website. … One of the group's advisers, Kris Kobach, is the former Kansas secretary of state known for his … close ties to the Trump administration. In January 2019, Kobach told the New York Times that he had described the organization to President Trump in a personal phone call and that he had given it his blessing. … Other advisers included Erik Prince, a conservative activist and defense contractor close to Bannon, as well as former congressman Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) and former Major League Baseball star Curt Schilling."
Attorney General Bill Barr knew about the investigation and was briefed about the arrest in advance: " The case was investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and charged in court by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. Two months ago, Barr had moved to oust Geoffrey Berman as the U.S. attorney there and replace him on an acting basis with Craig Carpenito, the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. The Bannon investigation was ongoing at that time, as was a probe involving Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney. Berman initially refused to step down, forcing Trump to fire him and promote Berman's deputy, Audrey Strauss, to replace him on an interim basis. The shake-up alarmed congressional Democrats, who accused Barr of maneuvering to quash investigations with consequences for the president's personal interests. Berman later told the House Judiciary Committee that the appointment of Carpenito or another outsider 'would have been unprecedented, unnecessary and unexplained and would have resulted in the delay and disruption of the office's investigations.'"
In a cosmic twist, Bannon was arrested by the Postal Service police. "When a Coast Guard vessel sped toward a yacht that had Bannon aboard Thursday morning, it carried the gun-toting members of the Postal Service's investigator unit," Alex Horton reports. "Many learned from news reports that their friendly neighborhood mail carrier is backed by a centuries-old investigative arm that handles cases of child exploitation, cybercrime, drug trafficking and financial crimes. … The U.S. Postal Inspection Service traces its roots further back than the United States itself. William Goddard was named the nation's first surveyor in 1775, a role created under Postmaster General Benjamin Franklin to audit postal accounts and investigate theft of mail or postal funds … That would make the USPIS the country's first and oldest federal law enforcement agency."
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is considering more aggressive changes to USPS after the election.
"The plans under consideration, described by four people familiar with Postal Service discussions, would come after the election and touch on all corners of the agency's work. They include raising package rates, particularly when delivering the last mile on behalf of big retailers; setting higher prices for service in Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico; curbing discounts for nonprofits; requiring election ballots to use first-class postage; and leasing space in Postal Service facilities to other government agencies and companies," Jacob Bogage, Lisa Rein and Josh Dawsey report. DeJoy is set to testify today before the Senate and on Monday before the House. While it is possible he will change the particulars of any plans under discussion after the election, he has made clear he intends to overhaul the service. "DeJoy has told associates he was brought in to stem the Postal Service's losses and that drastic changes were needed to make the agency solvent. He is determined to stay the course and make wholesale changes after the election, according to an associate who spoke with him recently."

Trump said he plans to use the law enforcement apparatus to monitor the election. "We're going to have everything," he told Sean Hannity on Fox News during the Democratic convention. "We're going to have sheriffs, and we're going to have law enforcement, and we're going to hopefully have U.S. attorneys and we're going to have everybody, and attorneys general." (Philip Bump)

Trump’s legal team filed an emergency motion asking for a delay in enforcing a subpoena to release his tax records.
Shortly after U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero threw out Trump's lawsuit attempting to block a subpoena by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who is seeking eight years of the president's financial records from his accounting firm, Trump's legal team filed an emergency motion asking the judge for a delay in enforcing the subpoena so Trump may appeal, Shayna Jacobs and David Fahrenthold report. Trump's team also asked a federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and stay the judge's ruling. Asked about the ruling, Trump predicted the case would eventually end up back at the Supreme Court.
The president echoed a key part of Stormy Daniels's account of her alleged extramarital affair with him. Trump said he's "not a big fan of sharks," adding he wouldn't donate to shark-saving organizations.

Before Biden's coronation, Trump took aim at him at a Pennsylvania rally.
In Old Forge, Pa., Trump accused his challenger of having "abandoned" Pennsylvania – even though Biden was only 10 when his family moved to Delaware so his father could get a job, Seung Min Kim and Felicia Sonmez report. "'He left,' Trump said of Biden. 'He abandoned Pennsylvania. He abandoned Scranton. He was here for a short period of time, and he didn't even know it.' … Biden has frequently visited Pennsylvania, and his 2020 campaign is headquartered in Philadelphia. During his time in the Senate, he was sometimes jokingly referred to as 'Pennsylvania's third senator' due to his roots in the state and the fact that large swaths of Delaware could be considered a suburb of Philadelphia. …
"Trump also cast Democrats as the party of 'mobs and criminals.' 'If you want a vision of your life under [a] Biden presidency, think of the smoldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago, and imagine the mayhem coming to your town and every single town in America,' Trump told the crowd." Reminder: Trump is president. These things are happening on his watch.
Pennsylvania was Trump's narrowest win in 2016. Democrats are feeling hopeful about Biden's chances. Local Democrats in the area Trump spoke at say they see evidence Luzerne County, which voted for Obama twice before electing Trump, could be swinging back in their favor as Biden courts the White working-class voters who defected four years ago. "And the convention that ended Thursday night with Biden paying tribute to his Northeastern Pennsylvania roots, they say, is likely to have helped their cause," Griff Witte reports. Kathy Bozinski, the Democratic Party chair in Luzerne, said she's been "absolutely overwhelmed by requests" for Biden yard signs. "At this point in the 2016 campaign, there was not even a fraction of the enthusiasm that we're experiencing now."
Nancy Pelosi endorsed Rep. Joe Kennedy over Sen. Ed Markey in the Massachusetts Senate primary.
The House speaker abandoned her longtime ally a few days after he lodged attacks on Kennedy and his iconic family dynasty, Paul Kane reports : "Pelosi cited Kennedy's hard work in campaigning for many of the Democrats who won in 2018, flipping the majority and returning her to the job of speaker, but she also cited her own family's close ties to the Kennedys, including her father's role running the Maryland campaign for John F. Kennedy's presidential bid in 1960. … Pelosi said that Markey's campaign had crossed a hallowed line by running a negative campaign against the Kennedy dynasty. … Pelosi, 80, signaled that it was time for a new crop of leaders who would represent 'this party's future,' a shot at Markey, 74, who has been in Congress for 44 years. …
"Markey has formed an alliance with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) over climate legislation that they called the Green New Deal. … Ocasio-Cortez, who has broken ranks with Pelosi to endorse primary challengers this year to incumbent Democrats, lashed out on Twitter over the speaker's decision to buck an incumbent in a Senate race. 'No one gets to complain about primary challenges again,' she tweeted, noting that Pelosi supported cutting off financial ties to firms that worked against House Democratic incumbents in primaries."
The coronavirusTrump just blocked the FDA from regulating coronavirus lab tests – over the agency's vigorous objections.
"The new policy stunned many health experts and laboratories because of its timing, several months into a pandemic. Some public health experts warned the shift could result in unreliable coronavirus tests on the market, potentially worsening the testing crisis that has dogged the United States if more people get erroneous results. They argued the change is unlikely to solve current testing problems, which at this point are largely due to shortages of supplies such as swabs and chemical reagents. But supporters cheered the change as long overdue, saying it could help get new and more innovative tests to market more quickly. They said that the FDA review process sharply slowed testing at the beginning of the pandemic and that the new policy could ensure such bottlenecks don't recur ," Laurie McGinley and Yasmeen Abutaleb report. 
"The change in policy came as a surprise to many at the FDA and was a point of intense disagreement between HHS Secretary Alex Azar and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn. Tensions have been rising between the two men for weeks, according to several people familiar with the situation … Hahn vociferously opposed the change … The episode is the latest in which health agencies have been undercut by political overseers. On Wednesday, for example, President Trump blamed the FDA for not yet authorizing the emergency use of convalescent plasma, a promising but unproven treatment. 'You have lot of people over there that don't want to rush things. They want to do it after November 3rd,' he said in a White House press briefing. …
"HHS officials also said they were unaware that the FDA began requiring emergency use authorizations, a kind of temporary approval, for laboratory-developed tests in February, after Azar declared a public health emergency. FDA supporters said the agency has followed the same practice during previous public health emergencies, including the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and the Zika outbreak in 2015 and 2016. They stressed that it is critical during health emergencies to make sure tests are accurate and not fraudulent.
"Some FDA backers inside and outside government worry the policy change may be a way to blame the agency for the February testing debacle that set the United States behind and allowed the virus to spread undetected for weeks. In February, the administration was relying almost entirely on a test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which is standard practice during public health crises — but the test was faulty. It took three weeks for the FDA to loosen restrictions that allowed other tests — at that time, mostly laboratory-developed tests — to come to market. Azar was head of the coronavirus task force at the time. The move, FDA backers say, may be an effort to allow Azar to argue he took action, albeit belatedly, to improve testing. There's also concern within the administration, some current and former officials say, about possible congressional investigations similar to the 9/11 commission that would probe what went wrong with testing and why the administration was not better prepared. No one wants to be blamed, the officials said."
Eleven of Trump's most senior officials, including Azar, voted during a 2018 White House meeting to separate migrant children from their parents under the leadership of Stephen Miller. Others who voted to take kids away from their parents include former attorney general Jeff Sessions, former Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and secretary of state Mike Pompeo. No one in the meeting made the case that separating families and putting kids in cages would be inhuman or immoral, NBC News reports .

Evidence is growing children may play a larger role in covid-19 transmission than previously believed.
A new study published in the Journal of Pediatrics "found that some children have high levels of virus in their airways during the first three days of infection despite having mild symptoms or none at all — suggesting their role in community spread may be larger than previously believed," Ariana Eunjung Cha reports . "One of the study's authors, Alessio Fasano, a physician at MassGeneral Hospital for Children, said that because children tend to exhibit few if any symptoms, they were largely ignored in the early part of the outbreak and not tested. But they may have been acting as silent spreaders all along."
Flu vaccine manufacturers have boosted production by about 15 percent, to record levels, with nearly 200 million doses for the United States. To expand access to the flu shot, federal health officials have issued a directive allowing pharmacists in all 50 states to give childhood vaccinations, including flu shots. The move was praised by some advocacy groups but drew sharp criticism from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which called the announcement "incredibly misguided." ( Lena Sun )
The World Health Organization said coronavirus cases are "steadily increasing" each week in Europe, a worrisome resurgence believed to be driven by infections among younger people. In all, Europe had reported nearly 2 million coronavirus cases — less than half the number in the United States – but the death toll in Europe exceeds that of the United States, with more than 180,000 fatalities compared with at least 170,000 here.

"North Carolina State University will switch all of its undergraduate classes online after clusters of coronavirus cases were found on campus this week, adding to the chaos of students scrambling to find new housing as more colleges shut down," Susan Svrluga reports .

Coronavirus cases have been linked to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, but the event’s full impact may never be known.
South Dakota health officials say a person who participated in the motorcycle rally this month and visited One-Eyed Jack's, a Main Street bar, for about five hours has tested positive for the coronavirus and could have transmitted the virus to others at the time, Hannah Knowles reports . Four days after the event, they are aware of fewer than 25 infections among people who attended in the 14 days before illness set in. But they also acknowledged they don't know the extent of the exposures and cannot track them down. The event's true impact may be impossible to track, said Benjamin Aaker, president of the South Dakota State Medical Association. For every case that's identified, he said, there are probably many more officials will never hear about because they'll be counted in the totals of other states.

American Airlines will cut service to 15 cities once the federal ban against service cuts expires. The carriers agreed to that restriction as part of a multibillion-dollar bailout. The change means 10 airports will soon lose their only airline service. The Pitt-Greenville Airport Authority in North Carolina said American called him Wednesday night to share news.

Full text: Gabe Rice began sheltering in his suburban Phoenix home with his wife and three youngest children in March. They worked remotely, learned remotely and put social events on hold to hunker down alongside much of the country.
It was challenging and frustrating, but, Rice initially assumed, temporary. It seemed like a plausible plan to help the nation get the pandemic under control within a couple of months.
But Arizona's economic reopening in May, urged by Gov. Doug Ducey (R), was soon followed by a spike in coronavirus infections in June, which became a terrible surge in hospitalizations and deaths by July.
Then came August, and the devastating realization for many Americans that the pandemic, which has killed at least 167,000 people across the country and sickened more than 5 million, is far from over.
"It's difficult when you think you have a light at the other end of the tunnel to look forward to, and then all of a sudden you realize it's a train," said Rice, 44, a program coordinator at Arizona State University.
An exhausted, exasperated nation is suffering from the effects of a pandemic that has upended society on a scale and duration without parallel in living memory.
The Rice family and millions of other Americans are wrestling with difficult questions about how to juggle school, pay their bills and look after their mental and physical health.
Parents lie awake, their minds racing with thoughts of how to balance work with their newfound role as home-schoolers. Frontline health workers are bone tired, their nerves frayed by endless shifts and constant encounters with the virus and its victims. Senior citizens have grown weary of isolation. Unemployed workers fret over jobs lost, benefits that are running out, rent payments that are overdue. Minority communities continue to shoulder the disproportionate burden of the contagion's impact, which in recent weeks has killed an average of about 1,000 people a day.
The metaphor of a marathon doesn't capture the wearisome, confounding, terrifying and yet somehow dull and drab nature of this ordeal for many Americans, who have watched leaders fumble the pandemic response from the start. Marathons have a defined conclusion, but 2020 feels like an endless slog - uphill, in mud.
Recent opinion polls hint at the deepening despair. A Gallup survey in mid-July showed 73 percent of adults viewed the pandemic as growing worse - the highest level of pessimism recorded since Gallup began tracking that assessment in early April. Another Gallup Poll, published Aug. 4, found only 13 percent of adults are satisfied with the way things are going overall in the country, the lowest in nine years.
A July Kaiser Family Foundation poll echoed that, finding that a majority of adults think the worst is yet to come. Fifty-three percent said the crisis has harmed their mental health.
In a podcast released Thursday, former first lady Michelle Obama directly addressed the mental toll, saying she has struggled with the quarantines, the government's response to the pandemic and the persistent reminders of systemic racism that have led to nationwide protests.
"I know that I am dealing with some form of low-grade depression," she said.
Historians say that not even the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 675,000 people in the United States, had the same kind of all-encompassing economic, social and cultural impact.
"One of the biggest differences between this virus and [the 1918] influenza is the duration," said John Barry, author of "The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History."
With the coronavirus, he said, the incubation period is longer, patients with symptoms tend to be sick longer, and many take longer to recover. Barry said leaders did not make sufficiently clear early on the simple epidemiological truth that this would be a painfully drawn-out event.
"Part of the frustration and disappointment and depression, frankly, is because of the expectation that we'd be through this by now," he said.
President Trump repeatedly promised a quick resolution. He conjured the image of church pews packed by Easter. The White House recommended 15 days of restrictions. That was then extended by 30 days, to the end of April. On Thursday, Trump said a vaccine could be ready by Election Day, Nov. 3 - a date well in advance of what his administration's own experts think is likely.
But the virus has repeatedly shown that it has its own timetable. The first wave of shutdowns helped reverse the frightening trend lines of March and early April but came nowhere close to crushing the opportunistic pathogen. And now the season of the pandemic is indisputably the year of the pandemic.
"This will be a long, long haul unless virtually everybody - or a very, very high percentage of the population, including the young people - take very seriously the kind of prevention principles that we've been talking about," Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview.
"It is within our power and within our will to really get it down to a level that's low enough that we can do many of the things that would get our economy going again," he added. "There will be a long slog if everybody doesn't pitch in."
Not everyone is experiencing the same level of stress, and everyone's pandemic struggles differ.
Any "essential" worker exposed to high-risk conditions day after day has more urgent concerns than someone merely stuck at home and missing out on summer barbecues.
In Cadiz, Ky., Stephanie Grant has endured one of the most trying years of her life. The 42-year-old lost her job at the end of April. For more than two months, as she waited for unemployment benefits to kick in, she fell behind on her car payment, utilities, insurance and rent for the apartment she shares with her two teenage daughters.
She drained most of her savings trying to remain afloat. She applied for jobs at gas stations and dollar stores. She pursued becoming a coronavirus contract tracer, but that also didn't come through.
"I could not get a job anywhere," she said. "I want to get back out there and work."
As her stress and her bills mounted, Grant turned to a Kentucky nonprofit focused on housing and homelessness. The group helped her catch up on her rent, and the arrival of her unemployment payments in late July have allowed her to catch her breath. For now.
"Right now, I'm wary. It seems like we are falling apart. The stress, the tensions, everything that's going on. . . . People are scared," she said.
And many people are bored, eager to socialize. In Harvey, La., Marlon "Buck" Horton operates a popular bar, Wo-de's Chill Spot. But Horton's bar permit was suspended in late July after complaints about what the state fire marshal described as "a large, non-socially distanced crowd."
Horton, 39, denied the fire marshal's report that he served alcohol indoors. He said people simply eager to grab a beer crowded outside, and a passerby posted a video of the gathering on Facebook, leading to the crackdown.
"We're stuck. We don't have assistance, and we still have landlords," Horton said last week. At a hearing soon after, the suspension was lifted when he agreed to pay a fine and abide by the state's coronavirus rules.
Although some states battered by the virus have made progress against it in recent weeks, it has infiltrated small towns with little previous exposure.
In Mississippi, George County is among eight counties that have been told to delay school reopenings for grades seven to 12 until Aug. 17 because of high rates of virus transmission. Superintendent of Education Wade Whitney realized how serious the pandemic had become locally when a co-worker in an adjacent office became severely ill and was hospitalized for five days.
"When that person catches it, it kind of hits you right between the eyes," Whitney said. "Small-town George County is not immune."
That co-worker was Matt Caldwell, the director of operations for the school district and the former head football coach at the high school. Caldwell, a big man who played offensive line for the Mississippi State Bulldogs in the early 1990s, had assumed it would be no big deal if he was infected.
"Boy, was I wrong," he said. "I definitely underestimated it. I tell everybody I talk to it's a real thing. Those people who think it's just a hoax and all that - I know this, I wouldn't wish what I went through on anybody."
Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, has become an oft-quoted expert during the coronavirus pandemic. But she's also a mother who is dismayed that her son Miles, 7, who should be entering second grade in a Maryland public school, will start the year with online-only instruction.
"I'm absolutely devastated. It's not learning," Nuzzo said.
This is not just back-to-school season, it's also the time when many counties and states hold their annual fairs. Those are being canceled right and left. Professional sports is now back on air, but in most cases without fans in the stadiums and arenas. Major League Baseball is trying to keep its revived season intact after several outbreaks of infection.
And there are the ordinary cancellations so many people have endured - birthdays not celebrated, weddings and funerals carried out over Zoom, trips not taken, loved ones not visited.
Joseph and Kelli Crawford of Gilbert, Ariz., had planned to travel to London in April for their 10th anniversary and for her sister's 30th birthday. Everything was booked: Flights, lodging, tickets to concerts and plays.
They rescheduled for March 2021. But now they worry that even that might be optimistic.
"I'm crossing my fingers. But I'm also not going to be packing my bags," said Kelli, 33.
A flight attendant, she also agreed to an 18-month voluntary separation from her work. She'll keep her health insurance and part of her salary.
But she won't be bored. All four of the Crawfords' children, ages 4, 5, 10 and 13, are home. The three oldest have begun remote classes. Their 4-year-old daughter has been aching to start preschool since she saw her older brother do so last year. But there is no virtual preschool, so that plan is on hold.
"It's one thing for the adults to be lonely," Kelli said. "But these poor kids, I get so heartbroken about the loneliness they're experiencing."
There are glimmers of hope for those staggered by this dire moment: The vaccine development for the novel coronavirus appears to be moving at unprecedented speed. There are promising therapeutics that may lower the mortality rate of those who become severely ill.
The pandemic will someday come to an end, experts promise, because all pandemics have. And though SARS-CoV-2 is a slippery and unpredictable virus, it has not proved as deadly as the 1918 influenza virus that swept across much of the planet.
"In 1918, practically every city in the country ran out of coffins," Barry said. Victims commonly died at home. "All these things led to much greater fear, which meant that people were also more willing to put up with anything that might help."
Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan, said that though similarities exist between today's outbreak and the influenza pandemic a century ago, American society was different at that time.
Americans had experienced epidemics of cholera, diphtheria and other diseases in the not-so-distant past. They were accustomed to children dying of smallpox, whooping cough and other diseases.
Unlike today, most Americans also had little confidence that a magic bullet would end the suffering and exasperation. "Another expectation of our era is the expectation that science will come up with a fix quickly," Markel said. "None of us have the patience for lengthy processes. We live in an instant society."
Still, Markel said, despite the seemingly endless nature of the current situation, history offers reasons for optimism. When the pandemic of 1918-1919 was over, for instance, people rebounded quickly.
"They went out and started dancing the Charleston, buying raccoon coats and buying stocks and bonds," he said. "It went from zero to 60 in no time flat."
This crisis, too, will pass.
"No question, epidemic fatigue or pandemic fatigue is real. We are experiencing it," Markel said. "But throughout human history, there have been terrible pandemics and contagious threats. Every civilization, every nation, has come through to the other side. And we will, too."

Full text: with Brent D. Griffiths
Economists say President Trump's executive actions on pandemic economic relief will vastly underdeliver for those most in need of help just as a shaky rebound hits a vulnerable patch.
They join a growing list of business groups, governors and employers who say rather than giving the president the upper hand in stalled negotiations, Trump's moves will delay the legislative progress needed to provide a durable fix.
"If this is all we get for fiscal policy for the rest of the year it would represent a significant downside risk to our growth outlook," JPMorgan Chase chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli wrote in a Monday note. "These executive orders likely will provide stimulus of less than $100 billion, while we have been expecting Congress to add at least $1.0-1.5 trillion of spending once an agreement is reached."
The firm's economists still believe Washington will deliver that agreement, but Feroli writes that Trump's intervention "could reduce the urgency for Congress and the White House to get a more comprehensive deal done."
The team at Oxford Economics comes to a similar conclusion, finding "the relief is inadequate, legally questionable and falls dramatically short of the booster shot the economy desperately needs," per a note from senior U.S. economist Lydia Boussour . "In the absence of a more comprehensive stimulus package, economic activity will be constrained just as the recovery plateaus."
Governors are also weighing in, calling Trump’s unilateral moves unworkable.
They are zeroing in on the president's single-handed attempt to extend enhanced unemployment benefits. The president proposed decreasing $600 in extra federal benefits for the jobless that expired at the end of July to a $400 weekly payment. But the feds would only pick up the tab for $300 of that — tapping $44 billion in disaster aid funds to cover it — with states kicking in the other $100.
Economists estimate the federal funding would last for five or six weeks, even though Trump suggested the benefits would go until the end of the year. But with a number of states facing severe budget constraints, it's also not clear how many could participate.
The plan would saddle governors with "significant administrative burdens and costs," per a statement from National Governors Association chairman Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York, and vice chairman Asa Hutchison, the Republican governor of Arkansas. Instead, they urge Congress and administration officials to reach a legislative solution.
"Officials in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Michigan also said Monday they are awaiting further guidance from Washington, only adding to the days in which millions of Americans have gone without enhanced federal jobless aid since the last round of relief expired July 31," Erica Werner, Tony Romm and Jeff Stein report.
Trump’s other actions likewise are drawing skepticism.
Some businesses, economists, and payment processors, for example, are questioning his move to suspend payroll taxes. They doubt whether employers will stop taking the tax out of their workers' paychecks, "in the absence of a guarantee that the payroll taxes will actually be absolved," Tony, Erica, and Jeff report. "Moreover," Feroli writes, "there remain questions about the constitutionality of this order, and those questions will reinforce caution on the part of employers." Trump said he would make the payroll tax holiday permanent only if he is reelected.
Trump said Monday he wants to take further action on his own. He told reporters his administration is "looking very seriously" at a capital gains tax cut — and a tax cut for middle-income families. "The president can't unilaterally cut the 20% long-term capital gains rate without Congress, but some advisers tell him he could issue an executive order that would slash tax bills for investors when they sell assets," Bloomberg's Laura Davison and Mario Parker report. "The move, known as indexing capital gains to inflation, adjusts the original purchase price of an asset when it is sold so no tax is paid on appreciation tied to inflation."
Meanwhile, the president's action that he billed as extending a moratorium on evictions offered less than meets the eye: It merely directs the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to "consider measures" to prevent evictions and identify funds that could help renters and homeowners.
Business groups are urging negotiators to resume working toward a legislative fix.
Lobbyists for big business interests in Washington, while striking a diplomatic tone, are making clear they have also concluded Trump's executive actions can't provide a pandemic-ravaged economy the extended backstop it needs.
Business Roundtable President Josh Bolten said his group, which lobbies on behalf of the nation's top chief executives, agrees "with the intent of the Administration's actions" but believes "only bipartisan legislation can provide the certainty and funding necessary to bolster the public health and economic response effectively in communities across the country now."
That followed a similar statement from Neil Bradly, chief policy officer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "While well intentioned, today's Executive Orders are no substitute for Congressional action," he said in a Saturday statement.
Meanwhile, 10,000 Small Business Voices — the small-business lobby organized by Goldman Sachs —is calling on lawmakers to "return to Washington and pass relief for America's small businesses," in a letter that will run as a full-page ad in The Washington Post on Wednesday. "Not one of us asked to be in this position," per the letter, signed by over 1,000 graduates of the firm's entrepreneurship program. "We take great pride in the important role we play in America's economy. All we want is to keep doing our jobs. Please show that our government works for us."
For all the outside encouragement, there is little sign negotiations are primed to restart.
For now, "political talks appear to have completely halted," Erica, Seung Min Kim, and Josh Dawsey report. And the talks made little progress over the last two weeks before collapsing, in part because White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has been holding a hard line.
"Unlike in previous rounds, when [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi held out for a better deal for Democrats and ultimately forced major concessions from Republicans, this time administration officials, led by Meadows, walked away," the Post team reports. "Now, Democrats are facing questions about their tactics and whether playing hardball will continue to work when someone like Meadows is intimately involved."
Coronavirus falloutMore from the U.S.:
At least 5,056,000 cases have been reported, at least 159,000 have died.
The White House is considering covid-related border restrictions: "O fficials have been circulating a proposal that would give U.S. border authorities the extraordinary ability to block U.S. citizens and permanent residents from entering the country from Mexico if they are suspected of being infected with the coronavirus," Chelsea Janes, Brady Dennis, Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey report. It's unclear whether the administration has legal authority to restrict U.S. citizens.
Cases in children rose sharply last month: " More than 97,000 U.S. children tested positive for the coronavirus in the last two weeks of July, more than a quarter of the total number of children diagnosed nationwide since March, according to data from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association," Chelsea Janes reports.
College football nears tipping point: "The fall college football season appeared to trudge closer to cancellation over concerns about the pandemic. As it did, a coalition of players, joined later by several coaches and politicians including [Trump], raised their voices to try to save it," Chuck Culpepper, Cindy Boren and Emily Giambalvo report.
More from the corporate front:
Kodak shares plunge after U.S. pauses loan after allegations of wrongdoing: "Kodak closed Monday at $10.52, down 29.3 percent. The stock has erased nearly 76 percent of its value since hitting $43.45 in late July," Hannah Denham reports. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation announced on Friday that the $765 million loan it gave the company to retrofit its factories to produce pharmaceutical ingredients until allegations about potential insider trading are cleared.
Amazon eyes old JCPenny and Sears stores: "Simon Property Group Inc. has been exploring with Amazon the possibility of turning some of the property owner's anchor department stores into Amazon distribution hubs … It wasn't clear how many stores are under consideration for Amazon, and it is possible that the two sides could fail to reach an agreement, people briefed on the matter said," the Wall Street Journal's Esther Fung and Sebastian Herrera report.
Royal Caribbean rises as it touts demand for 2021 cruises: Shares in the cruise giant " jumped 10 percent Monday after executives said there was pent-up demand … despite reporting a$1.6 billion loss for the second quarter and a cash burn rate in excess of $250 million a month," CNBC's Will Feuer and Seema Mody report.
Biotech IPOs surpass record: "So far this year, U.S.-listed biotech companies have raised roughly $9.4 billion in initial public offerings, already beating the $6.5 billion raised in all of 2018, the biggest year on record, according to Dealogic data going back to 1995," WSJ's Corrie Driebusch reports.
Marriott sees cash burn slowing as bookings recover: "The world's largest hotel chain said it was seeing a steady recovery in occupancy rates across the world with economies reopening gradually, although it may take a few years for them to return to pre-covid levels," Ashwini Raj reports.
Around the world:
Russia announces it has approved a coronavirus vaccine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said his daughter has been inoculated already. "Officials have pledged to vaccinate millions of people, including teachers and front-line health-care workers, with the experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow this month, raising global alarm that the country is jumping dangerously ahead of critical, large scale testing that is essential to determine if it is safe and effective," Isabelle Khurshudyan and Carolyn Johnson report.
Global cases surpass 20 million: "The tally of coronavirus cases reported worldwide surpassed 20 million on Monday night, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, that number represents double the infections that had been reported as recently as late June … More than half the cases reported to date were found in just three countries: the United States, Brazil and India," Antonia Farzan reports.
Market moversDow jumps 350 points.
Stocks continued a strong week of gains: "The 30-stock Dow advanced 357.96 points to 27,791.44, a gain of 1.3 percent. Boeing and Dow Inc. were among the best-performing stocks in the blue-chip index, rising more than 5 percent each. Caterpillar, considered to be a bellwether for the global economy, also climbed more than 5 percent.JPMorgan Chase added 1.2 percent," CNBC's Fred Imbert reports.
"Meanwhile, the S&P 500 climbed 0.27 percent to finish at 3,360.47 as both the energy and industrials sectors rose more than 2.4 percent as cyclical stocks led the major indexes higher on the week's first day of trading."
Airlines' shares surge as after federal data shows travel increase: "The number of people passing through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints at U.S. airports rose for a second consecutive week with 831,789 people on Sunday alone, its highest level since March 17," CNBC's Leslie Josephs reports.
"United Airlines shares added more than 9 percent to $37.54, Delta Air Lines closed nearly 8 percent higher at $29.34, while American Airlines ended the day at $14, more than 7 percent higher. Southwest Airlines rose more than 5 percent to $34.99. The S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent."
Some analysts see a big caveat: The main concern is what will happen to demand as peak summer season wanes, not to mention that " TSA traffic is still down by about 70% from the same time a year ago, meaning airlines have far to go before recovering to normal levels …"
Tim Cook becomes the latest tech billionaire: "Nine years after Steve Jobs stepped down and thrust Tim Cook to the top of Apple Inc., the company is more valuable than ever — and so is Cook," Bloomberg News's Anders Melin and Tom Metcalf report.
"Apple's share price rose almost 5 percent last week, leaving the company Jobs co-founded 44 years ago in his parents' California home on the cusp of a stock-market milestone: a market value of nearly $2 trillion. It was valued at about $350 billion when Jobs died. Cook, meantime, has joined one of the most elite clubs for CEOs who didn't actually found the companies they run: his net worth has eclipsed $1 billion, according to calculations by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index."
Pocket changeTikTok could give Microsoft numerous headaches.
The tech giant has been able to avoid some of the scrutiny plaguing Facebook and Twitter: "To say that TikTok represents a business that is radically different than the enterprise software that Microsoft specializes in would be an understatement," CNBC's Salvador Rodriguez reports.
"Like other social apps, TikTok is a target for all kinds of problematic content that must be dealt with. This includes basic problems such as spam and scams, but more complicated content could also become headaches for Microsoft. This could include content such as misinformation, hoaxes, conspiracy theories, violence, prejudice and pornography, said Yuval Ben-Itzhak, CEO of Socialbakers, a social media marketing company."
Tech companies back legal challenge to Trump's foreign worker restrictions: "Apple, [Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Twitter were among 52 companies that signed the brief, which was filed in a lawsuit brought by the National Association of Manufacturers, which represents 14,000 member companies, as well as in a similar lawsuit brought in Washington, D.C.," Reuters's Ted Hesson reports.
"Trump issued a presidential proclamation in June that suspended the entry of a range of foreign workers until the end of the year, a move his administration said would free up jobs for unemployed Americans amid the economic fallout of the pandemic." (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
McDonald's sues former CEO Steve Easterbrook: The fast-food company is suing to "recover his severance and compensation package, alleging that he lied about having multiple affairs with employees and covered up the evidence, according to a regulatory filing," Hannah Denham reports.
"McDonald's said it reopened the case in July after receiving an employee report about Easterbrook's conduct. It later discovered emails involving 'dozens of nude, partially nude, or sexually explicit photographs and videos of various women.'" Easterbrook was terminated last November after McDonald's board of directors alleged that he had showed poor judgment and violated corporate policy that forbids managers from having relationships with subordinates.
Chicago closes parts of downtown: "Hundreds of young people looted stores, broke into indoor shopping malls and battled with police overnight Sunday into Monday in the city's central downtown business district," Mark Guarino, Tim Elfrink and Teo Armus report.
"The reason for the unrest, according to several looters who spoke to The Post, were reports alleging a police-involved killing of a Black man on the city's South Side late Sunday afternoon. But police said those accounts were misinformation spread across social media that appeared to encourage people to head downtown to create violence … Chicago's downtown is now closed indefinitely between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. Police will be dispatched to outlying neighborhoods to prevent continued looting this week, [Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown] said."
The regulatorsThe Fed sets capital reserves for big banks.
It markets the first time the Fed has set custom ratios for each bank. " Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were ordered to hold the most capital of the 34 firms tested, with ratios of 13.7% and 13.4% respectively," Reuters's Pete Schroeder reports. " The custom capital requirements follow stress test results released in June, which found that banks would weather heavy capital losses should the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic drag on or worsen. The Fed ordered banks to cap dividend payments and bar share repurchases until at least the fourth quarter to ensure they have sufficient cushions."

Full text: Gabe Rice began sheltering in his suburban Phoenix home with his wife and three youngest children in March. They worked remotely, learned remotely and put social events on hold to hunker down alongside much of the country.
It was challenging and frustrating, but, Rice initially assumed, temporary. It seemed like a plausible plan to help the nation get the pandemic under control within a couple of months.
But Arizona's economic reopening in May, urged by Gov. Doug Ducey (R), was soon followed by a spike in coronavirus infections in June, which became a terrible surge in hospitalizations and deaths by July.
Then came August, and the devastating realization for many Americans that the pandemic, which has killed at least 159,000 people across the country and sickened more than five million, is far from over.
"It's difficult when you think you have a light at the other end of the tunnel to look forward to, and then all of a sudden you realize it's a train," said Rice, 44, a program coordinator at Arizona State University.
An exhausted, exasperated nation is suffering from the effects of a pandemic that has upended society on a scale and duration without parallel in living memory.


The Rice family and millions of other Americans are wrestling with difficult questions about how to juggle school, pay their bills and look after their mental and physical health.
Parents lie awake, their minds racing with thoughts of how to balance work with their newfound role as home-schoolers. Frontline health workers are bone tired, their nerves frayed by endless shifts and constant encounters with the virus and its victims. Senior citizens have grown weary of isolation. Unemployed workers fret over jobs lost, benefits that are running out, rent payments that are overdue. Minority communities continue to shoulder the disproportionate burden of the contagion's impact, which in recent weeks has killed an average of about 1,000 people a day.

The metaphor of a marathon doesn't capture the wearisome, confounding, terrifying and yet somehow dull and drab nature of this ordeal for many Americans, who have watched leaders fumble the pandemic response from the start. Marathons have a defined conclusion, but 2020 feels like an endless slog — uphill, in mud.
Recent opinion polls hint at the deepening despair. A Gallup survey in mid-July showed 73 percent of adults viewed the pandemic as growing worse — the highest level of pessimism recorded since Gallup began tracking that assessment in early April. Another Gallup Poll, published Aug. 4, found only 13 percent of adults are satisfied with the way things are going overall in the country, the lowest in nine years.
A July Kaiser Family Foundation poll echoed that, finding that a majority of adults think the worst is yet to come. Fifty-three percent said the crisis has harmed their mental health.
In a podcast released Thursday, former first lady Michelle Obama directly addressed the mental toll, saying she has struggled with the quarantines, the government's response to the pandemic and the persistent reminders of systemic racism that have led to nationwide protests.
"I know that I am dealing with some form of low-grade depression," she said.
Historians say that not even the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 675,000 people in the United States, had the same kind of all-encompassing economic, social and cultural impact.
"One of the biggest differences between this virus and [the 1918] influenza is the duration," said John Barry, author of "The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History."

With coronavirus, he said, the incubation period is longer, patients with symptoms tend to be sick longer, and many take longer to recover. Barry said leaders did not make sufficiently clear early on the simple epidemiological truth that this would be a painfully drawn-out event.
"Part of the frustration and disappointment and depression, frankly, is because of the expectation that we'd be through this by now," he said.
President Trump repeatedly promised a quick resolution. He conjured the image of church pews packed by Easter. The White House recommended 15 days of restrictions. That was then extended by 30 days, to the end of April. On Thursday, Trump said a vaccine could be ready by Election Day, Nov. 3 — a date well in advance of what his administration's own experts think is likely.
But the virus has repeatedly shown that it has its own timetable. The first wave of shutdowns helped reverse the frightening trend lines of March and early April but came nowhere close to crushing the opportunistic pathogen. And now the season of the pandemic is indisputably the year of the pandemic.
"This will be a long, long haul unless virtually everybody — or a very, very high percentage of the population, including the young people — take very seriously the kind of prevention principles that we've been talking about," Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview.
"It is within our power and within our will to really get it down to a level that's low enough that we can do many of the things that would get our economy going again," he added. "There will be a long slog if everybody doesn't pitch in."
Not everyone is experiencing the same level of stress, and everyone's pandemic struggles differ. Any "essential" worker exposed to high-risk conditions day after day has more urgent concerns than someone merely stuck at home and missing out on summer barbecues.
In Cadiz, Ky., Stephanie Grant has endured one of the most trying years of her life. The 42-year-old lost her job at the end of April. For more than two months, as she waited for unemployment benefits to kick in, she fell behind on her car payment, utilities, insurance and rent for the apartment she shares with her two teenage daughters.
She drained most of her savings trying to remain afloat. She applied for jobs at gas stations and dollar stores. She pursued becoming a coronavirus contact tracer, but that also didn't come through.
"I could not get a job anywhere," she said. "I want to get back out there and work."
As her stress and her bills mounted, Grant turned to a Kentucky nonprofit focused on housing and homelessness. The group helped her catch up on her rent, and the arrival of her unemployment payments in late July have allowed her to catch her breath. For now.
"Right now, I'm wary. It seems like we are falling apart. The stress, the tensions, everything that's going on. … People are scared," she said.
And many people are bored, eager to socialize. In Harvey, La., Marlon "Buck" Horton operates a popular bar, Wo-de's Chill Spot. But Horton's bar permit was suspended in late July after complaints about what the state fire marshal described as "a large, non-socially distanced crowd."
Horton, 39, denied the fire marshal's report that he served alcohol indoors. He said people simply eager to grab a beer crowded outside, and a passerby posted a video of the gathering on Facebook, leading to the crackdown.
"We're stuck. We don't have assistance, and we still have landlords," Horton said last week. At a hearing soon after, the suspension was lifted when he agreed to pay a fine and abide by the state's coronavirus rules.
Although some states battered by the virus have made progress against it in recent weeks, it has infiltrated small towns with little previous exposure.
In Mississippi, George County is among eight counties that have been told to delay school reopenings for grades seven to 12 until Aug. 17 because of high rates of virus transmission. Superintendent of Education Wade Whitney realized how serious the pandemic had become locally when a co-worker in an adjacent office became severely ill and was hospitalized for five days.
"When that person catches it, it kind of hits you right between the eyes," Whitney said. "Small-town George County is not immune."
That co-worker was Matt Caldwell, the director of operations for the school district and the former head football coach at the high school. Caldwell, a big man who played offensive line for the Mississippi State Bulldogs in the early 1990s, had assumed it would be no big deal if he was infected.
"Boy, was I wrong," he said. "I definitely underestimated it. I tell everybody I talk to it's a real thing. Those people who think it's just a hoax and all that — I know this, I wouldn't wish what I went through on anybody."
Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, has become an oft-quoted expert during the coronavirus pandemic. But she's also a mother who is dismayed that her son Miles, 7, who should be entering second grade in a Maryland public school, will start the year with online-only instruction.
"I'm absolutely devastated. It's not learning," Nuzzo said.

This is not just back-to-school season, it's also the time when many counties and states hold their annual fairs. Those are being canceled right and left. Professional sports is now back on air, but in most cases without fans in the stadiums and arenas. Major League Baseball is trying to keep its revived season intact after several outbreaks of infection.
And there are the ordinary cancellations so many people have endured — birthdays not celebrated, weddings and funerals carried out over Zoom, trips not taken, loved ones not visited.
Joseph and Kelli Crawford of Gilbert, Ariz., had planned to travel to London in April for their 10th anniversary and for her sister's 30th birthday. Everything was booked: Flights, lodging, tickets to concerts and plays.
They rescheduled for March 2021. But now they worry that even that might be optimistic.
"I'm crossing my fingers. But I'm also not going to be packing my bags," said Kelli, 33.
A flight attendant, she also agreed to an 18-month voluntary separation from her work. She'll keep her health insurance and part of her salary.
But she won't be bored. All four of the Crawfords' children, ages 4, 5, 10 and 13, are home. The three oldest have begun remote classes. Their 4-year-old daughter has been aching to start preschool since she saw her older brother do so last year. But there is no virtual preschool, so that plan is on hold.
"It's one thing for the adults to be lonely," Kelli said. "But these poor kids, I get so heartbroken about the loneliness they're experiencing."
There are glimmers of hope for those staggered by this dire moment: The vaccine development for the novel coronavirus appears to be moving at unprecedented speed. There are promising therapeutics that may lower the mortality rate of those who become severely ill.
The pandemic will someday come to an end, experts promise, because all pandemics have. And though SARS-CoV-2 is a slippery and unpredictable virus, it has not proved as deadly as the 1918 influenza virus that swept across much of the planet.
"In 1918, practically every city in the country ran out of coffins," Barry said. Victims commonly died at home. "All these things led to much greater fear, which meant that people were also more willing to put up with anything that might help."
Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan, said that though similarities exist between today's outbreak and the influenza pandemic a century ago, American society was different at that time.
Americans had experienced epidemics of cholera, diphtheria and other diseases in the not-so-distant past. They were accustomed to children dying of smallpox, whooping cough and other diseases.

Unlike today, most Americans also had little confidence that a magic bullet would end the suffering and exasperation. "Another expectation of our era is the expectation that science will come up with a fix quickly," Markel said. "None of us have the patience for lengthy processes. We live in an instant society."
Still, Markel said, despite the seemingly endless nature of the current situation, history offers reasons for optimism. When the pandemic of 1918-1919 was over, for instance, people rebounded quickly.
"They went out and started dancing the Charleston, buying raccoon coats and buying stocks and bonds," he said. "It went from zero to 60 in no time flat."
This crisis, too, will pass.
"No question, epidemic fatigue or pandemic fatigue is real. We are experiencing it," Markel said. "But throughout human history, there have been terrible pandemics and contagious threats. Every civilization, every nation, has come through to the other side. And we will, too."

Full text: President Trump’s decision to cancel the Jacksonville convention underscores how the coronavirus has upended the presidential race. This afternoon, he signed several executive orders addressing the high price of drugs in the United States.
[Follow the DNC Live: Biden’s speech, schedule, start time, streaming and more.]
Trump saw his convention as a potential success story. Reality intervened.
The announcement by President Trump that he was canceling the Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Fla., next month was the most vivid evidence to date of how the Covid-19 pandemic and his mixed signals on the virus are upending the 2020 presidential contest.
Until Thursday afternoon, Mr. Trump had been pushing for a crowded, festive convention, complete with a boisterous acceptance speech. He saw it as a celebration of his presidency and an instructive contrast to Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Democratic Party, which have been moving toward a slimmed-down, mostly virtual convention in Milwaukee. It would show the Republican Party as tough in the face of this threat to the national well-being, focused on protecting the economy and returning life to normal — a statement as symbolic as the fight over wearing masks in public.
But at the end of the day, the pullback is not surprising, coming two days after Mr. Trump, in another reversal, endorsed the use of masks. The virus has been exploding across much of the South, and particularly in Florida.
The state has become, arguably, a case study in how not to deal with the virus, and that almost certainly would have been a running story for the thousands of reporters who would have come to Jacksonville to cover the convention. The state’s governor — Ron DeSantis, a Republican and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump — has resisted the kinds of actions, such as requiring masks or instituting stay-at-home-orders, that have been taken by other governors to try to bring the pandemic under control. Mr. DeSantis headed to the White House this afternoon for the signing of an executive order on drug prices before meeting with Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff.
Life these days is about balancing risk and reward, and that applies to presidents and national political parties as well as ordinary citizens. Republican elected officials, donors and party members were all growing apprehensive about putting themselves at risk; some leading senators had already said they would skip it. The Democrats had decided the risk of a crowded convention outweighed the benefits that came from packing thousands of people into an arena for four days.
Mr. Trump’s decision came as a surprise to officials in Florida’s largest city, who spent 43 days insisting they could host the event, despite warnings from public health experts. The event would have been a rare moment in the sun for Jacksonville, a city often eclipsed by Atlanta and its Florida counterparts.
“The First Coast has always been very much the last coast in Florida politics and culture,” said Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Florida political strategist who grew up in Gainesville, about 70 miles away. “They strive mightily and frequently come up short — and this would be another example of that.”
The R.N.C.’s Jacksonville experiment was painful. But at least it was short — and probably for the best, everyone agrees, in retrospect.
“They may have inadvertently dodged a bullet,” Mr. Stipanovich said.
U.S. intelligence warns of foreign interference in the election. But Democrats say it’s not enough.
American intelligence officials issued a public warning on Friday that China was “expanding its influence efforts” in the United States ahead of the presidential election, along with Russia and Iran, but Democrats briefed on the matter said the threat was far more urgent than what the administration described.
The warning came from William R. Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, in a statement 100 days before Americans go to the polls. “We’re primarily concerned with China, Russia and Iran — although other nation-states and nonstate actors could also do harm to our electoral process,” the statement said.
The intelligence warning on Friday did not accuse the Chinese of trying to hack the vote; instead it said they were using their influence “to shape the policy environment in the United States” and to pressure politicians “it views as opposed to China’s interests.”
Russia, the warning said, was continuing to “spread disinformation in the U.S. that is designed to undermine confidence in our democratic process,” and it described Iran as an emerging actor in election interference, seeking to spread disinformation and “recirculating anti-U.S. content.”
The statement was short on details, reminiscent of the vague warnings that the director of national intelligence turned out starting in October 2016 that, in retrospect, failed to seize the attention of officials and voters before the last presidential election.
In a statement issued a few hours later, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was joined by the Senate Democratic leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, and two key Democrats on intelligence oversight committees, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, in saying that the descriptions of malign activity were “so generic as to be almost meaningless.”
Mr. Evanina’s statement, said the four Democrats, who earlier called on the F.B.I. to give a briefing on disinformation campaigns to the entire Congress, “does not go nearly far enough in arming the American people with the knowledge they need about how foreign powers are seeking to influence our political process.”
Trump signed several executive orders aimed at lowering U.S. drug prices.
Mr. Trump on Friday afternoon signed three executive orders targeting the high price of prescription drugs in the United States, finalizing a proposal to tie the price that Medicare pays for some drugs to the lower prices that European countries and Canada pay. He said he would refrain from signing a fourth order, holding off until late August.
“We are going to be getting massive drug savings in Florida and other states,” said Mr. Trump, speaking at a White House event. “We’re doing something that should have been done a long time ago.”
Populist outrage over rising drug prices has been a leading campaign issue for Republicans and Democrats alike, who before the pandemic were inundated with questions about them at town hall meetings. Consumers have been increasingly exposed to rising drug prices as insurers have imposed high deductibles and required people to pay a percentage of a drug’s list price.
The orders, which alone cannot change policy, revives pledges made as far back as his 2016 campaign to tackle prescription drug costs, even if it means beating back opposition by the pharmaceutical industry and his own political party. In 2018, Democrats promised to curb drug costs, an argument that helped the party flip suburban swing districts and win control of the House.
Aware of the political dynamics, the president didn’t miss an opportunity to take a shot at his presidential rival, Mr. Biden, accusing the “Obama-Biden” administration with failing to make progress on reducing costs.
But the orders come at a delicate time. Mr. Trump has placed billions of dollars in bets that giant drugmakers like Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson will deliver coronavirus treatments and vaccines in time to save his faltering re-election campaign. He needs those companies to produce results, even as he is attacking them on the price of their other products. During his event, Mr. Trump touted the progress being made by the drugmakers.
The centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s executive orders, called an “international pricing index,” ties the price that Medicare pays for drugs administered by hospitals or in doctors’ offices to prices negotiated by European governments. Mr. Trump has called for such a system since 2018, railing against drug companies for ripping off Americans.
“Americans pay more so that other countries can pay less,” Mr. Trump said when he first proposed it.
But the proposal has sputtered in the face of resistance from the pharmaceutical industry and Republican lawmakers, and infighting among federal health officials. Conservative critics of the index have viewed it as a form of price fixing.
The orders reflect the president’s own frustrations that the United States consistently pays higher prices for drugs than the governments of peer countries. They also come with irony, just days after the Trump administration signed a $1.95 billion contract with Pfizer as part of the administration’s crash vaccine development program, called “Operation Warp Speed.”
Trump’s new campaign manager says polls are flawed and that ‘we don’t pay very much attention to them.’
The new campaign manager for Mr. Trump’s re-election effort spent much of his first briefing focused on polling — from four years ago.
Bill Stepien, who took the helm of the campaign operation last week, argued to reporters on a Friday afternoon briefing call that public polling about the race showing Mr. Trump at a steep deficit is flawed. Running through slides focused on each battleground state, Mr. Stepien displayed polls from the 2016 race showing Hillary Clinton leading in states eventually won by Mr. Trump.
He insisted the campaign still has multiple paths to 270 electoral votes, arguing Mr. Trump could expand the number of states in play for Republicans.
“We don’t pay very much attention to them,” Mr. Stepien said of several dozen public polls. He argued that some of the most respected university and media survey-takers were undercounting Republicans in their polls. He also boasted of the number of organizers Mr. Trump has had on the ground in key states for more than a year, who so far overshadow efforts for Mr. Biden.
He went on to suggest that Democrats are leaving their party because of the left-leaning bent of figures like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and that they’re coming to Mr. Trump’s side, something that public polling doesn’t reflect.
Then he went state by state, describing North Carolina as positive (“I feel pretty good about North Carolina”) and Florida as improving (“Our band is getting back together”). He said that there have been voter registration switches in states that have been unaccounted for in the public polling.
“These trends are going to go unnoticed until election night when we’re right and they’re wrong,” Mr. Stepien said.
The coronavirus pandemic has upended the presidential race, prompting a sharp downturn in a voter opinion of Mr. Trump. In recent weeks, public polling has shown Mr. Biden with a commanding advantage in the race for the White House — an edge that shows no sign of abating.
Mr. Biden has held a nearly double-digit lead in an average of polls for more than a month. The last time a candidate sustained such a large advantage for so long was nearly 25 years ago, when Bill Clinton led Bob Dole in 1996.
Mr. Biden is leading or in a dead-heat with Mr. Trump in nearly all the key battleground states. On Friday, the Cook Political Report moved their rating of Florida from toss-up to leans Democratic, a notable switch in a state that’s been fiercely contested by both parties for more than two decades.
Authorities suspect arson in a fire that tore through the Arizona State Democratic Party headquarters.
Arizona authorities are investigating a fire at the State Democratic Party headquarters in Phoenix that they believe was intentionally set.
Heavy smoke and fire billowed from the building around 1 a.m. as firefighters arrived on the scene early Friday morning after the security smoke alarms went off, according to Democratic officials. There were no injuries and no one was inside the building at the time.
In a media advisory, the Phoenix Fire Investigation Task Force said the fire is being investigated as arson, based on evidence discovered at the scene.
Steven Slugocki, the chairman of the Maricopa County Democratic Party, which also had offices in the building, said he had been told that the fire was started after a person threw an object through a window and it exploded. The act was caught on video and the authorities have begun to search for a suspect.
The county party lost nearly everything, Mr. Slugocki said, including computers, phones, tablets, campaign signs and hard copies of their voter files.
“It’s pretty devastating, with a hundred days to go,” he said. “We’re going to have to rebuild, buy all new stuff and find office space. It’s tough.
Biden steps up warnings that Trump may try to ‘steal’ the election.
Mr. Biden, who for months has argued that President Trump may seek to interfere in the presidential election results, issued one of his sharpest warnings yet this week.
“This president is going to try to indirectly steal the election by arguing that mail-in ballots don’t work,” the presumptive Democratic nominee said at a fund-raiser Thursday night, according to a pool report. “‘They’re not real,’” he said Mr. Trump would argue. “‘They’re not fair.’”
The remark capped an extraordinary week in which both presidential candidates sought to lay down markers on critical questions around election legitimacy, taking two sharply divergent approaches.
Mr. Biden and his campaign issued stark warnings about foreign interference in the election and lambasted Mr. Trump’s approach to foreign meddling.
“He knew full well of Russian involvement in the election in ’16,” he said at another fund-raiser. “He’s done nothing. He sought help.”
Representatives for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Mr. Trump, for his part, repeatedly decried voting by mail — a view that stands in contrast to many Republicans who embrace the practice — and he refused to commit to accepting the election results during an interview Sunday with Fox News’s Chris Wallace, an approach that may be aimed at sowing doubts about the outcome of the election should he lose.
Taken together, the statements reflect a dark phase of the presidential campaign in which there is no shared agreement on even the most fundamental tenets of American democracy.
Kimberly Guilfoyle’s fund-raising for Trump draws scrutiny.
Kimberly Guilfoyle’s popularity with major donors caught the attention of President Trump last year, as she traveled the country appearing at fund-raisers for his re-election campaign with her boyfriend, Donald Trump Jr.
Ms. Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host, had been hired by the campaign as a senior adviser, but in December, the president personally asked her to lead the fund-raising effort of Trump Victory, his campaign’s main committee for major donors.
She accepted, and was tasked with developing a network of mid-tier supporters who are seen as pivotal to Mr. Trump’s chances of winning a second term, and with whom he never formed a deep bond in 2016.
Ms. Guilfoyle made inroads with some of the donors who had rejected calls from others on Mr. Trump’s team. Yet Trump supporters inside and outside the campaign now say the operation she has built hasn’t lived up to the expectations of some Trump fund-raisers, and that her management style and that of some of her aides have alienated others.
Some of the problems have been attributed to the inability to conduct in-person fund-raising since the coronavirus pandemic began shutting down Mr. Trump’s donor events in March. Midlevel donors tend to give more when they can see and speak with the president.
But in interviews with The New York Times, Ms. Guilfoyle’s critics said that she had devoted a disproportionate amount of attention to glitzier, high-dollar fund-raising, and that they believed she used her position — and the fact that she’s seen as a de facto member of the Trump family — to support her public image and lifestyle. Most of those interviewed insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.
Suppose Biden wins big in November. What would the effects be?
Recent national polls show that Mr. Biden’s commanding lead has eroded longstanding demographic divisions that have favored Republicans, Nate Cohn writes for The Upshot.
This development has endangered the G.O.P.’s hold on states where Democrats usually have little chance to prevail in federal elections, even Republican strongholds like Kansas or Alaska.
Remarkably, Mr. Trump’s lead among white voters has all but vanished. On average, he holds just a three-point lead among white voters, 48 percent to 45 percent, across an average of high-quality telephone surveys since June 1. His lead among white voters has steadily diminished since April.
Over the last two decades, Republican strength among white voters has given the party structural advantages in the House, the Senate and the Electoral College. A competitive race among white voters would deprive Republicans of those advantages, threatening carefully devised gerrymanders in House races and raising the specter of previously unimagined losses in the Senate.
Mr. Trump still has plenty of time to close the gap with Mr. Biden. But with Mr. Biden’s lead enduring well into a second month amid a worsening coronavirus pandemic, it’s worth considering the potential consequences of a decisive Biden victory.
To illustrate, we took the results of the 2016 election by demographic group and calculated what would happen if those groups backed Mr. Trump at the levels shown in recent polls. Mr. Biden would fight to within single digits in traditional red states like Alaska, Utah, South Carolina, Indiana, Montana, Missouri and Kansas. And notably, he would win by nine to 10 points in the three Northern battleground states that decided the last election: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Fact Check: Trump’s claims in battleground states.
While many of Mr. Trump’s more incendiary falsehoods — his many misleading remarks about the coronavirus and his baseless attacks on election integrity — have received widespread attention, some of his more localized claims also require scrutiny.
During a town hall event in Scranton, Pa., in March, Mr. Trump said that the city and the state “ had the lowest and best unemployment numbers ” ever, and he told attendees at a rally in Phoenix, “Arizona, you’ve had the best year, the most successful year you’ve ever had in the history of the country.”
Exaggerated. Mr. Trump overreached with these claims. The unemployment rate in Pennsylvania reached 4.1 percent in 2018, higher than the 4.0 percent rate in the first few months of 2000. In the Scranton area, it reached 4.4 percent in 2018, also higher than the 4.1 percent in September 2000. Arizona’s unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent January, while the recorded low was 3.6 percent in June and July 2007.
“I love saying it because we are funding, for New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Army National Guard readiness centers just a few miles from here, in Pembroke and in Concord,” Mr. Trump said during a campaign rally in the state in February.
Omits context. Those facilities were funded by annual appropriations bills that passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities.
In addition, Mr. Trump devoted 10 tweets in May to various transit projects that had received funding from the Transportation Department, five of which were in the swing states of Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But he failed to note that the projects were part of the Capital Investment Grant program, which is authorized and structured by Congress.
Why Wall Street might be wrong to worry about a Biden presidency.
The stock market chatter this summer has often been dominated by worries about the prospects of a Biden presidency.
The logic was simple: Corporate taxes might rise, and that would hamper profits. But that’s perhaps too simple, as a new report from BofA Global Research argued.
The report said that once the market had gotten over its reflexive distaste for a Democratic victory, a Biden win could be a boon for both stocks and the economy.
For example, a Biden administration would likely mean a steadier and more vigorous handling of the coronavirus crisis and a more open approach to international trade, the report said.
Those conclusions run counter to the narrative promoted by Mr. Trump, who has frequently boasted that the stock market and the economy have flourished under his stewardship and has warned of serious trouble if he were to lose in November.
This isn’t the first time the stock market has shuddered at the thought of a Democratic presidency. Yet the historical record shows that since 1900 the stock market has fared far better under Democratic presidents, with a 6.7 percent annualized return for the Dow Jones industrial average compared with just 3.5 percent under Republicans.
And despite all the hoopla about Mr. Trump’s undoubtedly pro-business policies, the stock market performance under Mr. Trump doesn’t match up well against the presidencies of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. It is possible that the same would be true if Mr. Biden became president.
Trump details his love for Twitter, saying that he enjoys it ‘too much sometimes.’
Mr. Trump expressed his love for Twitter in a new interview, admitting that perhaps sometimes he enjoys the social media platform a little bit too much.
The president discussed his social media habits on Thursday in a one-on-one conversation with Dave Portnoy, the founder of the sports and culture blog Barstool Sports, both bragging about his massive Twitter following and wistfully reminiscing about a time before online communication.
When asked whether he enjoys using Twitter, Mr. Trump responded: “There are times when I love it. Too much sometimes.”
“We put it out instantaneously, we feel great, and then you start getting phone calls: ‘Did you really say this?’” he said, noting that “it’s the retweets that get you in trouble.”
Mr. Trump also commented on the “vicious business” of American politics, saying he finds the United States tougher to deal with than rival powers including China, Russia and North Korea.
“The best day in my life, in terms of business and life and everything, was the day before I announced I was running for president,” he said.
With his company under fire for allegations of racism and sexism, Mr. Portnoy has attracted his own share of controversy. He has also attracted the favorable attention of right-wing media, with several of his tweets being amplified by Trump supporters and even the president himself.
The N.R.A., making its first advertising buy of the election, focuses on four key battleground states.
The National Rifle Association has made its first advertising buy of the 2020 election, spending more than $3.5 million across four states for the final two weeks of August, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm.
The group is focusing on Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina, with the biggest reservations in Pennsylvania at $1.4 million.
Though it has been quiet on the airwaves this election, the National Rifle Association was one of the staunchest backers of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. As the two super PACs supporting Mr. Trump spent less than $25 million each in the election, the N.R.A. spent more than $30 million backing the president.
The N.R.A.’s wading into election spending also comes as the group has struggled financially and has had layoffs and furloughs this year.
And as the N.R.A. has struggled, gun control groups have surged. The 2018 midterms marked the first time they outspent the N.R.A.
The trend could continue in 2020. Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group backed by Michael R. Bloomberg, has pledged to spend at least $60 million in the 2020 election. On Thursday, it announced a $15 million digital advertising effort, targeting both vulnerable Republican senators and state legislatures, as well as ads that will support Mr. Biden.
The National Rifle Association declined to comment on its advertising buy.
In Washington, at least, Senate Republicans have started distancing themselves from Trump.
As Senate Republicans’ grip on their majority teeters while the president’s political standing plummets, their fate could well be determined by their ability to produce a sweeping pandemic recovery package before the election.
But their frantic attempts to do so have so far produced little more than deep division in their ranks and with Mr. Trump — not the place they wanted to be 100 days out from a decisive race.
Their uncertain fortunes appear to have stiffened Republicans’ resolve to do something they rarely try: distance themselves, however gingerly, from Mr. Trump. They have jettisoned the president’s call for a payroll tax cut, drawing a resentful response from him on Twitter.
They rejected the administration’s plan to omit money for coronavirus testing — an effort many senior Republicans see as crucial to reopening the country and stabilizing the economy — and to defund schools that fail to resume in-person classes in the fall.
Republicans said they were nearing agreement on a $1 trillion package that would be introduced on Monday, but the tortured process that they went through to get there has weakened their negotiating hand relative to Democrats, who are pressing for a $3 trillion plan. And it has dramatized the growing divergence between their interests and Mr. Trump’s instincts.
Even as they privately haggled over the aid bill on Thursday, Republicans publicly defied Mr. Trump on another matter, voting for the annual military policy bill that he has threatened to veto over its requirement that the Pentagon rename bases named for Confederate figures. Many Republicans believed his stance was out of step with public opinion amid a nationwide conversation about racism in the United States.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez leads Democratic women in denouncing sexism in Washington.
Ever since Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came to Congress as the youngest woman elected to the House, she has upended traditions, harnessing the power of social media and challenging leaders, including Mr. Trump, who are many decades her senior.
On Thursday, she took to the House floor to read into the Congressional Record a sexist vulgarity that Representative Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, had used to refer to her.
“In front of reporters, Representative Yoho called me, and I quote: ‘A fucking bitch,’” she said. “These are the words Representative Yoho levied against a congresswoman.”
Then Ms. Ocasio-Cortez invited a group of Democratic women in the House to come forward to express solidarity with her. One by one, they shared their own stories of harassment and mistreatment by men, including in Congress. More even than the profanity uttered on the House floor, where language is carefully regulated, what unfolded over the next hour was a remarkable moment of cultural upheaval on Capitol Hill.
“It happens every day in this country,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “It happened here on the steps of our nation’s Capitol.” And then, in an unmistakable shot at Mr. Trump, she added, “It happens when individuals who hold the highest office in this land admit to hurting women and using this language against all of us.”
John Lewis will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda, one of the highest American honors.
Congressional leaders announced Thursday that Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a civil rights icon, would lie in state next week in the Capitol Rotunda, one of the highest American honors, before a viewing for the public to be held outside.
With the Capitol closed to the public because of the pandemic, Mr. Lewis will spend only a few hours lying in state under the Capitol dome after an invitation-only ceremony on Monday afternoon, according to plans released by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.
Afterward, his coffin will be moved outside to the top of the Capitol steps, and members of the public will be able to line up — with masks required and social distancing enforced — to view it from the plaza below on Monday evening and all day Tuesday, the leaders said in a joint statement.
Mr. Lewis, a 17-term congressman from Georgia and the senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, died last week after battling pancreatic cancer. He was known as the “conscience of the Congress” for his moral authority acquired through years of protest for racial equality — including when he was brutally beaten during voting rights demonstrations in Selma, Ala., in 1965 and across the Jim Crow South.
Last year, Representative Elijah E. Cummings became the first Black lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol. It is an honor that has been afforded to more than 40 individuals, most recently including Mr. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, President George H.W. Bush and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
A Nashville surgeon running for Senate gets a boost from Ted Cruz at a rally, but a mask mandate is not followed.
He’s a doctor who is holding public campaign rallies, eschewing masks, and running as a pro-Trump candidate, but without the president’s endorsement.
Manny Sethi, the conservative Nashville trauma surgeon vying in a crowded G.O.P. primary to replace the retiring Senator Lamar Alexander, got a boost Friday when Senator Ted Cruz arrived in Tennessee to join campaign rallies in several cities for him.
Mr. Cruz appeared at a campaign rally Friday morning in Jonesborough wearing a mask upon arrival, according to a video posted on Facebook by the local TV station WJHL, but Mr. Sethi’s face was fully exposed as he shook hands with those in attendance, many of whom were flouting a local Washington County mandate requiring masks in public.
A day earlier, Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths had reached new highs in Tennessee, where citizens were generally noncompliant with admonitions by health officials to wear face coverings, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
Running as a conservative who will roll back Obamacare, Mr. Sethi also has the endorsement of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.
In an era of self-funded candidates, Mr. Sethi, the son of physicians who immigrated to the United States from India, has joined those relying partly on a personal fortune, loaning his campaign $1.9 million.
But he’s just one of the candidates in the Tennessee Senate race who have tapped millions from their own accounts.
The biggest spender, the businessman and former ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty, who is endorsed by Trump, took out a $2.5 million bank loan to help promote his campaign.
And yet another doctor, the Memphis radiologist George Flinn, also dug into his own piggy bank. Mr. Flinn is running as an un-Trump candidate, pledging to challenge the president when he makes bad decisions.
In all, 12 Republicans, five Democrats and nine independents are running for the Senate seat, with primary voting Aug. 6.

Full text: Armed with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, C-SPAN testimonies and a former Lincoln-Douglas debater's penchant for arguing, Phil Cochetti has spent months wading into Facebook groups created to oppose covid-19 shutdowns and mask mandates.
To many, he's a "troll" with too much free time. He posts links and keeps comment chains going until others peel off — or until he gets kicked out by admins, which tends to happen swiftly. He pleads: "Do me the honor of hearing me out, and I will listen to you all day."
He's a 36-year-old research coordinator for the department of biostatistics, epidemiology and informatics at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine who's made a stay-at-home hobby out of defending states' pandemic-era restrictions and combating coronavirus misinformation on social media. Posting resources for his friends and diving into the online communities where misinformation thrives, he's part of an everyday line of defense against the deluge that's overwhelmed even professional fact-checkers — comments from family, friends or total strangers on the lookout.
The efforts can feel futile, even as research suggests that average citizens of the Internet are a real force in correcting misperceptions. One person's trusted source in the crisis is another's political hack.
" My biggest thing is, there is this outright rejection of science and what our best scientific knowledge is able to impart," Cochetti said in an interview.
‘No politics’
Lots of people have been using social media during the pandemic to provide "observational correction," where others are watching and potentially benefiting, said Emily Vraga, an associate professor in health communication at the University of Minnesota. She co-led a March survey in which more than 1 in 5 Americans reported having told someone during the previous week that they shared misinformation on the coronavirus.
That's slightly higher than other research has found for corrections in general, according to Vraga — maybe because there's simply so much to debunk with covid-19, or maybe because "any decision you make is inherently about your community."
"Any choice you make has implications for everyone you might come into contact with," Vraga said. "And so that could be motivating people to engage in more correction than they might on other issues or topics."
Those kinds of fact checks have an impact, she said — along with social media platforms' efforts to debunk and remove falsehoods — and are usually most effective when people point to a credible expert.
However, she notes her latest data is from early on in the pandemic. The politicization of the country's main tools against the virus, from face masks to mass testing, was just getting started.
" I don't know how well the CDC, for example — which has long been that gold standard, trusted-across-party-lines organization — I don't know if that's still the case with how political this has become," she said.
Some people are trying to create online bubbles where "NO POLITICS" is the explicit rule. Discussion in a roughly 2,700-member public Facebook group called "COVID-19: Scientific Sources and Reputable News" is filled with Nature articles, trackers and a pinned "hoax post" thread. Comments below a Sunday post promoting a "fireside chat" with infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci made no mention of the drama unfolding as the White House moved to discredit its own adviser.
Creator Elizabeth Lilly, a 56-year-old Santa Cruz-area resident, said she wanted to attract and benefit people "across the aisle," though admins say they're reevaluating whether "NO POLITICS" is possible when scientists are under political attack.
She says she made the group with two friends after watching another online group — despite a similar mission — struggle to weed out posts about unproven miracle cures. She's given up trying to convince the few anti-vaxxers on her timeline, and one of her fellow admins has had people in an environmental Facebook group dismiss news articles from a variety of countries as "corporate media" with an agenda.
"You always have to consider that you're talking to the people who are listening quietly," Lilly said.
She explains her ideal approach to a fact check: "If you can be diplomatic and reasonable — " then pauses.
She's a newly laid-off library worker with extra health concerns, a history enthusiast who's read extensively about pandemics.
"It's sometimes hard to be diplomatic when you're really frustrated, when you really feel that there is a lot riding on this."
Into unfamiliar territory
Cochetti, the medical school employee — he works on clinical trials, sometimes interacting with patients and other times analyzing the data — quickly became a member of "Scientific Sources and Reputable News" in March. The coronavirus had been on his radar early, he said, thanks to an epidemiologist friend who posted Jan. 3 on Facebook about a mysterious respiratory disease emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
In April, he ventured into a much more political online space that sprung up around covid-19.
He read about the pro-gun activist siblings behind some of the biggest Facebook groups calling for protests of stay-at-home orders in the United States, including "Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine" in his home state. Cochetti started Googling, joined the Pennsylvania group and recalls he was eventually kicked out after posting articles about rising infection rates in Kentucky and about the siblings. (Administrators did not respond to inquiries from The Washington Post.)
That was the start of a crusade to bring the quarantine-critical crowd around to his views — maybe an exercise in "self-flagellation," as he admits, all while he worried: about his mom, his dad, his stepmom whose elementary school-age niece told her she valued her life too much to come visit.
It was "a way to vent my own anxiety about what's going on and hopefully to change some minds about the root of what we need to do next," Cochetti said as he worked from home.
Next came Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland, where he has family, friends or work connections. In "Marylanders Against Excessive Quarantine," instead of being barred, he found members willing to engage.
Much of Cochetti's disagreement with members came down to policy and the right course of action. How much risk justified shutting down society? How serious was this?
" I feel like we have, you know, no voice, no advocacy, no lobbying," Mike Stewart Jr., a 36-year-old martial arts teacher who co-founded the Facebook group, said in an interview when his academies were still suffering under closure orders. " I think some of the shutdown protocols have been pretty heavy-handed and unfair to small businesses while allowing the bigger businesses to stay operational."
But Stewart's group was also, like many of its counterparts in other states, a freewheeling forum containing falsehoods and distortions: conspiracy theories about vaccines; a video about "murder" at a hospital that YouTube took down; accusations that a federal health official's statements are just meant to distract from the woman behind a viral debunked film called "Plandemic."
"This is chock-full of half truths, fraud, bad medical advice, and just poor quality," Cochetti wrote below the hospital "murder" post.
It was the start of a four-paragraph response, but if it swayed anyone, it's not clear. Victory, to Cochetti, looked like someone saying they watched the video he posted, or having a polite back-and-forth in the comments ("I agree to a point … ") or messaging privately and eventually agreeing they'd be fine to one day "have a beer" together.
Stewart affirmed that virtually no content would be removed, saying he's not there to police viewpoints or determine accuracy: If you're an adult on the Internet who drinks Lysol because someone told you to, he said, "I don't have a terrible amount of sympathy for you ."
Asked about Cochetti, Stewart said he was unimpressed with someone "reposting any article you have" and "just repeating everything that you've been hearing." He's not sure he'd trust even a scientific study, though he'd listen to an infectious-disease specialist friend of his at Johns Hopkins.
" I do not trust the police. I don't trust the media. I don't trust doctors. And I don't trust the government," Stewart said. " I trust my friends and my family."
It's a common sentiment in "Marylanders Against Excessive Quarantine" — no longer publicly visible because it was archived a few weeks ago, after restrictions lifted — and in other groups that have persisted as states with spiking cases tighten back up, in some cases swelling to more than 100,000 members. It's also an outlook that's stymied Cochetti again and again.
Once, in the Maryland group, Cochetti shared a link to a report about a "superspreader" choir practice in Washington state. One person went with coronavirus symptoms; 87 percent of the other 60 people in attendance ended up as confirmed or "probable" covid-19 patients, the report stated. Two died.
"Median age was 69," someone commented, directing some profanity at Cochetti.
"This was in Washington state what exactly does it have to do with Maryland?" said another further down. "Also i don't believe this is a true article more propaganda BS by the snowflakes."
"Trump's CDC released it … " Cochetti wrote below.
There was no reply.

Full text: Note to readers: James Hohmann is on vacation until July 20. We have an all-star lineup of guest hosts from The Post to ensure you stay informed during his absence. 
Last week, when a little girl crashed her mom's BBC interview, the world laughed, excusing the mischief as part of our new stay-at-home reality. In response to the video, parents shared similar experiences of their young children joining their work calls, photobombing the background of their Zoom meetings or simply being kids as the adults in the room try to push through an hour of work during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The video, however, also highlights a pressing reality for parents trying to balance caring for their children and the pressures of their full-time jobs while staying at home: It feels nearly impossible to juggle both. And that's the case even if you're lucky enough to be healthy, have a full-time job and a partner to help manage the parenting.
It's not too soon to say the pandemic has sparked a child-care crisis in America, as schools and child-care   centers nationwide closed and the burden of managing kids has fallen disproportionately on women, leading some to quit their jobs.
Part of the problem for families juggling everything during the pandemic is the lack of options: some people have none. Others rely on nannies or members of their extended family like grandparents who are more vulnerable to infection and thus not allowed inside their childrens' homes. A nd many child-care centers across the nation have shut down.
Child-care providers across the nation are experiencing outbreaks that forced them to close.  At least 1,335 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Texas child-care facilities. Of those, 441 were children, CNN reports. There have been 13 coronavirus outbreaks at child-care facilities across Utah, per the Salt Lake Tribune, leading to 61 infections. Closures occurred after cases were connected to three day-care centers in Indiana and Kentucky. And in Arizona, a preschool made headlines after a former employee said the school failed to notify staff and parents of three coronavirus cases.
A quarter of child-care workers – 258,000 people – have lost their jobs amid the pandemic, my colleague Heather Long reported. According to the   liberal think tank Center for American Progress, the coronavirus could lead to the permanent loss of nearly 4.5 million child-care slots in day cares if Congress doesn't take action to ensure that these facilities have the resources they need to safely open and offer their services to overworked parents.
Still, the federal government hasn't met calls for increased child-care funding.   So far, Congress has allotted just $3.5 billion in child-care aid as part of its coronavirus relief packages. That isn't enough, said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who, along with Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.),   introduced a measure that would create a $50 billion fund to help stabilize the child-care sector. The National Women's Law Center estimates that it would cost at least $9.6 billion a month to keep current child-care providers in business. 
The legislation would support the safe reopening of child-care centers across the nation, a sector of the economy DeLauro said deserves as much attention as the airline industry, which received billions more in relief aid. The pandemic, DeLauro said, has exposed "how backwards" the United States is in terms of prioritizing affordable, accessible child care for families "who cannot afford to be at work if their kids are not in a safe environment."
"What is the plan for getting people back to work? Part of that plan has to do with how you deal with how they take care of their children," she said, dismissing the notion that accessibility to child care is a "women's issue." "They're family issues and, above all, they're economic survival issues not just for families but for our economy going forward."
DeLauro's bill would provide grants to help child-care businesses pay for staff, sanitation, personal protective equipment and training related to health and safety practices, as well as other costs associated with reopening a child-care facility amid a pandemic. Other members of Congress, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have joined the calls to bail out child-care businesses across the country. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) is sponsoring the Senate's version of DeLauro's bill.
Economists agree a $50 billion boost could be enough to save child-care businesses and prevent a greater shortage of care. And while Congress is also debating whether it should extend supplemental unemployment benefits beyond July 31, many economists argue that child care is a more pressing issue.
And because women are often the primary caregivers at home, a relief package for child-care facilities could also avoid setting back American women's job prospects for years . 
Eliza Navarro, a Texas nurse, told Heather that she had to quit her job in April when she couldn't find child care for her two children. That same month, women accounted for 55 percent of job losses in the nation, per the National Women's Law Center. Navarro, a single mom, was forced to choose between her job and her children. "I had no choice but to quit. I want to work, but because of everything that happened with schools and day cares closed, I wasn't able to," Navarro, 33, said.
Navarro is part of the 13 percent of U.S. parents who've had to quit their job or reduce their hours due to a lack of child care, according to a Northeastern University survey. An analysis by the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute found that 50 million Americans   are having to think about how to care for their kids before returning to their workplaces. 
About 11 percent of the U.S. workforce – 17.5 million workers –   is   taking care of young kids on their own and will be unlikely to return to work full-time until schools and day cares fully reopen, the institute found. And because many people of color have jobs that are deemed essential, the lack of child-care access becomes yet another side effect of the pandemic that has disproportionately affected   American minorities. 
Murray, the lead sponsor behind the Senate's child-care aid bill, told me that if the country were to lose the millions of child-care slots, "parents — especially women and in particular women of color — are going to struggle even more to handle both work and family care."
"Sometimes I hear people discussing a vaccine like it's some guaranteed silver bullet that should be ready to arrive on demand. We're all starved for hope. I get it. But this isn't magic. It's science, which means protocols and phases and data to collect. There has to be room for trial and error," said Ian Haydon, who was one of the first people in the clinical trial for a Moderna covid-19 vaccine. (Eli Saslow) 
States are mandating masks and have begun shutting down again as cases soar and hospitalizations rise.  "The pandemic map of the United States burned bright red Monday, with the number of new coronavirus infections during the first six days of July nearing 300,000 as more states and cities moved to reimpose shutdown orders," Joshua Partlow and Nick Miroff report. "The United States is 'still knee deep in the first wave' of the pandemic, Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said… Fauci noted that while Europe managed to drive infections down — and now is dealing with little blips as it reopens — U.S. communities 'never came down to baseline and now are surging back up.' … The country's rolling seven-day average of daily new cases hit a record high Monday — the 28th record-setting day in a row. 
"In Arizona, 89 percent of the state's intensive care unit beds were full Monday morning, the state's Department of Health announced, as the recently hard-hit state surpassed 100,000 cases. In Miami-Dade County, authorities reversed course on a reopening plan, issuing an emergency order that shut down gyms, party venues and restaurants, with exceptions for takeout and delivery. … Despite the steep new rise in infections, the House and Senate have adjourned for a two-week recess, setting up a potential battle when they return over another pandemic relief package. And more politicians continue to contract the virus . In Mississippi, where cases are rising, several lawmakers have tested positive, including the speaker of the State House of Representatives. Gov. Tate Reeves (R) wrote on Twitter he was 'briefly in contact' with one of them, so he plans to isolate himself until he gets his own test results back. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) tweeted Monday evening that 'COVID-19 has literally hit home. I have had NO symptoms and have tested positive.'  
"The United States has reported 2.9 million coronavirus cases to date, and at least 127,000 people have died of the virus nationwide. … Some states imposed fresh restrictions on Monday in an attempt to tamp down rising case numbers and preserve hospital capacity. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) announced that face coverings will be mandatory inside buildings, and he asked residents to comply voluntarily. … Trump has played down the rise in cases, attributing it to expanded testing, and has recently emphasized that U.S. deaths have not spiked with new cases. … Other Republicans have struck a more serious tone. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday said: 'This is not over.'"
Businesses tied to members of Congress got emergency loans from the Small Business Administration.  "Data released Monday by the SBA shows that businesses owned by members of Congress and the law practice that represented Trump were among the hundreds of thousands of firms that received aid from the agency," Jonathan O'Connell, Aaron Gregg, Steven Rich, Anu Narayanswamy and Peter Whoriskey report. "While it buttressed a swath of industries and entities, including restaurants, medical offices, car dealerships, law firms and nonprofits, the agency did not filter out companies that have potential conflicts of interest among influential Washington figures … 
"Among some of those receiving relief were Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao's family's shipping business. In addition, at least seven members of Congress or their spouses received loans, including lawmakers who were directly involved in shaping regulations and also benefited from a blanket waiver of ethics concerns. … Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) benefited when three of his car dealerships, located outside of Pittsburgh, received a combined total of between $450,000 and $1.05 million to retain 97 jobs, according to the data. … Several plumbing businesses affiliated with Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), all based in Broken Arrow, Okla., each received between $350,000 and $1 million. … 
"The lawyer who represented Trump in the Mueller investigation, as well as dozens of tenants of Trump's real estate company, also received money … At 40 Wall Street, an office building Trump owns in Lower Manhattan, 22 companies received loans, for a combined total of at least $16.6 million … Triomphe Restaurant Corp, which operates the Jean-Georges restaurant at the Trump International Hotel on Central Park West, got between $2 million and $5 million. … Another politically connected loan recipient was New York law firm Kasowitz, Benson & Torres, headed by longtime Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz, which received between $5 million and $10 million in PPP funds to support about 400 employees. … 
"As part of its $660 billion small-business relief program, the SBA also handed out loans to private schools catering to elite clientele, firms owned by foreign companies and large chains backed by well-heeled Wall Street firms. Nearly 90,000 companies in the program took the aid without promising on their applications they would rehire workers or create jobs…
"The data shows the government issued $521 billion in loans in all, with an average loan size of $107,000. … Among the loan recipients, 48,922 reported zero as the number of jobs they would retain with the money, and 40,506 applicants appeared to leave that section blank. … About half of the money went to five industries . The health-care and social assistance industry received 12.9 percent of the money; 12.7 percent went to professional and technical services; 12.4 percent went to construction; 10.3 percent went to manufacturing; and 8.1 percent went to hotels, restaurants and other food service employers."
Other SBA beneficiaries include:

Albright Stonebridge Group, a consulting firm run by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, received between $2 million and $5 million. (Daily Beast)
A wing of Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform also received a loan. The firm is known for its work to not raise taxes and has decried the fiscal scale of the government's coronavirus response. (Daily Beast)

Mitch McConnell called for a possible round of stimulus checks in the next coronavirus relief bill. The new round of checks would be aimed at workers making $40,000 a year and less. "McConnell said he intends to release a new bill as the starting point for talks that will take place with coronavirus cases surging anew and economic pain still racking the nation," Erica Werner, Jeff Stein and Rachael Bade report. "McConnell has consistently said the next bill will include liability protections for businesses, health-care providers, universities and schools. He offered a time period for these protections on Monday, saying he envisioned a 'narrowly crafted liability protection' for activities related to the novel coronavirus that would kick in December 2019 and last through 2024. … 
"With some Republican senators resistant to spending any more money at all, McConnell will face a challenge finding consensus among Senate Republicans and with a Trump administration that is itself divided, even before starting negotiations with Democrats, who are pushing for much more new spending than Republicans support. He said that in addition to liability protections, the new bill will focus on getting kids back to school, restoring jobs and boosting the health-care system, but he did not offer details on those issues. … Already, thorny disputes are shaping over what to do about enhanced unemployment benefits that expire July 31, additional aid that Democrats are demanding for state and local governments, and the possible new round of stimulus checks." 
Meanwhile, evictions are likely to skyrocket as jobs remain scarce.  "A backlog of eviction cases is beginning to move through the court system as millions of Americans who had counted on federal aid and eviction moratoriums to stay in their homes now fear being thrown out. A crisis among renters is expected to deepen this month as the enhanced unemployment benefits that have kept many afloat run out at the end of July and the $1,200-per-adult stimulus payment that had supported households earlier in the crisis becomes a distant memory," Renae Merle reports. "Of the 110 million Americans living in rental households, 20 percent are at risk of eviction by Sept. 30, according to an analysis by the Covid-19 Eviction Defense Project, a Colorado-based community group. African American and Hispanic renters are expected to be hardest hit."
International students must take classes in person to stay in the country legally, ICE said.  "University officials scrambled Monday to adapt to new federal guidance that does not allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking classes online only. It also left some students expressing fears on social media that they risked being suddenly deported," Susan Svrluga reports. "On Monday, the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program announced, 'The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States. … Active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status.' … Monday's announcement requires universities to certify by July 15 whether they will be fully open, operate on a hybrid model or offer online-only classes."
Top colleges started announcing their fall plans. All involve remote learning.  "Princeton University announced Monday it will cut tuition 10 percent in the coming school year and bring no more than half its undergraduates to the campus in New Jersey," Nick Anderson reports. "Harvard University said it will bring about 40 percent of its undergraduates to its campus in Massachusetts, most of them freshmen. All undergrad classes in the fall will be delivered remotely, no matter where the students live, but Harvard's tuition will remain the same … Georgetown University, meanwhile, will invite freshmen to its D.C. campus and bar most others from living there in an effort to protect public health."
Virginia reported no daily covid-19 deaths for the first time in three months.  "The District, Maryland and Virginia reported 659 new known coronavirus cases Monday, bringing the regional total to more than 146,000 since the start of the pandemic. The daily increase is the smallest number in the three jurisdictions since April 3," Dana Hedpgeth and Fenit Nirappil report. "The region recorded five new fatalities Monday, with no daily deaths reported in Virginia for the first time since March 28. It is also the lowest regional number of deaths since that date. … The District on Monday reported 33 new cases and two deaths. In Maryland, 272 new cases and three fatalities were reported. Virginia had 354 new cases. Several key measures of the virus have been improving in the Washington region, experts say, and the daily average caseload has plateaued after weeks of decline. … Officials also cautioned that the region could have an increase in cases after celebrations tied to the Fourth of July holiday."

Breonna Taylor's family claims that she was alive after being shot but was not given aid.  "For up to six minutes after she was shot by police officers during a drug raid, Breonna Taylor, an emergency room technician, lay dying in her apartment but received no medical aid, her family claims in a new court filing. The document also contends that the post-midnight raid on March 13 was motivated by the mayor's desire to clear a block in one of Louisville's most blighted neighborhoods for redevelopment," the Times reports. "City officials called the claims a 'gross mischaracterization,' while the coroner who performed the autopsy said the young woman's injuries would have been lethal even with intervention. … The shooting had taken place in near darkness, and officials say they didn't know initially that Ms. Taylor was injured." 
A spike in gun violence has alarmed New York City.  "A young father crossing a Bronx street, holding hands with his 6-year-old daughter. A 15-year-old who refused to talk to the police in Manhattan. A man in a Staten Island public housing complex, found prone in his apartment. They were among 64 people shot in a surge of shootings over the weekend in New York City, the police said," the Times reports. "The city surpassed 400 shootings in the first half of the year for the first time since 2016, with 528 by the end of last month; the 205 shootings in June were the highest for that month since 1996, the police said. Other cities have seen similar spikes in shootings, most notably Chicago, where the current pace of homicides has the city poised to near its record high of 778 set in 2016." 
The Pentagon is considering a base-wide ban on Confederate flags.  "[An] official said the draft policy being considered at the Pentagon's highest levels would build on recent moves by military services to bar Confederate symbols on facilities they control and, if approved, would represent the first Defense Department-wide prohibition of such iconography," Missy Ryan and Alex Horton report. "Military bases generally are not swathed in Confederate flags. Many barracks and homes on post carry the U.S. flag, service-specific banners, the colors of service academies or sports teams and college teams. The Confederate flag can more often be found on T-shirts, service members' tattoos, bumper stickers or banners hanging inside a barracks."  
Trump said the noose found in NASCAR racer Bubba Wallace's garage was a "hoax." Trump said "Wallace should apologize to those who stood beside him after his racing team discovered a noose in his garage stall at Talladega Superspeedway on June 21, describing the incident as a 'hoax.' Trump added an assertion that the Wallace incident and NASCAR's ban on the Confederate flag at its races have led to historically low television ratings for the stock-car circuit," Matt Bonesteel and John Wagner report. Many, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Wallace had nothing to apologize for. And NASCAR's viewership on Fox's networks is up more than 8 percent since the sport returned from a hiatus. 
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump's view on the flag by claiming he doesn't have one.  "The president has made clear he was not taking a position one way or the other in that tweet," McEnany said when asked for an unequivocal stance on the Confederate flag. In his tweet about Wallace, she said, he was trying to make a point about the importance of letting "facts come out." 
Virginia schools are dropping their Confederate names, ignoring calls to preserve "history." "Prince William County is renaming Stonewall Middle School, named after Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson, for a local black couple," Hannah Natanson reports. "Loudoun County voted last month to remove the mascot for Loudoun County High School: the Raiders, named for Confederate Col. John S. Mosby's troops."  
Amy Cooper, the white woman who called the police on a black birdwatcher, was charged with filing a false report.  The misdemeanor carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail or three years' probation and a fine of up to $1,000, Michael Brice-Saddler reports. Robert Barnes, a California-based attorney who said he's representing Cooper, told NBC that "the rush to judgment by some in the public, in this cancel culture epidemic, will be proven as wrong as cancel culture itself."
The Trump White House finally invoked the Armenian genocide, if by accident. "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, may not be happy about this one. After decades of the United States government declining to acknowledge the Armenian genocide because it would alienate Turkey, the White House on Monday invoked the term — albeit indirectly," Aaron Blake reports. "In the course of decrying protesters desecrating memorials across the country, [McEnany] referred to a memorial to the genocide by its proper name. 'There seems to be a lack of understanding and historical knowledge when the Armenian Genocide Memorial, remembering victims of all crimes against humanity, including slavery, is vandalized,' McEnany said. … The inclusion by McEnany was meant to reinforce the haphazard nature of the protesters' alleged disregard for history. But it also trod into uneasy waters for an administration that, like its predecessors, has conspicuously avoided using the g-word." 
A federal judge, in a surprise decision, ruled that the Dakota Access pipeline — which Trump approved within a month of taking office — must be shut down by Aug. 5, saying federal officials failed to carry out a complete analysis of its environmental impacts.

The Supreme Court said a state may require presidential electors to support the winner of its popular vote and may punish or replace those who don't. The case – which was a unanimous decision – is the first time the issue of "faithless electors" is considered by the court, as well as the issue of whether the constitution sees members of the electoral college as representatives of the intent of their state's voters or as independent thinkers. (Robert Barnes)
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López-Obrador is traveling to Washington this week to meet Trump to celebrate the new North American trade agreement. The visit has angered politicians in both countries. In the U.S., Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus said the meeting is "a blatant attempt to politicize the important U.S.-Mexico relationship," while Mexican leaders said they're worried that the presidents' first face-to-face meeting will imply support for Trump's reelection bid.

While the publisher last week was released from a temporary restraining order, Mary Trump is still under the order and is contesting it. A news release about the book says it deals with how Trump "acquired twisted behaviors and values" such as that "cheating is a way of life." (Michael Kranish)

Full text: WILMINGTON, Del. – Joe Biden doesn't just want to ensure that every person in this country gets free testing for the novel coronavirus. He wants their treatment covered, too, no matter whether or how they are insured.
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also calls for adding $200 per month to the checks of everyone who collects Social Security, temporarily increasing Medicaid funding by 12 percent and expanding food stamp benefits by 15 percent.
Biden, who has mostly stayed in his house here for nearly four months, will venture out Tuesday afternoon to deliver a speech at a local school on his vision for fighting the coronavirus crisis.
As infections and hospitalizations surge, and with the United States poised to surpass 125,000 confirmed covid-19 deaths as soon as today, Biden will recall how President Trump described himself as a "wartime" leader at the start of the pandemic and then accuse him of "surrendering to the virus."
"Americans social distanced and did their part to bend the curve, but Trump didn't lead," Biden plans to say, according to a preview shared by aides.
Biden will argue that the need for federal outlays to contain the worst public health crisis since 1918 and the worst economic crisis since 1933 is only growing – and he wants to guarantee emergency paid leave not just for everyone who gets covid-19 but also those who care for them – "for as long as they need to recover."
Biden's address, on this final day of June, comes amid the looming expiration of emergency relief programs enacted early in the spring. Enhanced unemployment benefits will expire on July 31. The Paycheck Protection Program will stop accepting new loan applications today. Mortgage payment holidays and eviction freezes are due to lapse in many states over the coming weeks.
But both White House officials and congressional Republican leaders have said they do not feel any particular urgency to pass another round of stimulus spending, offering to begin negotiations in the latter half of July after Congress returns from a two-week holiday recess.
Pointing to growing evidence of the economy's shakiness, Biden says more must be done "to make Americans who lose their jobs financially whole by ensuring they get their unemployment insurance on time and in full." He wants every essential worker who qualifies to receive federal child-care assistance and other emergency support, along with an unspecified boost in pay.
Several of Biden's proposals focus on getting workers back on the job and children back in schools. He calls for increasing federal funding to K-12 schools to help them reopen, scaling up National Institutes of Health funding to support pediatric research and building what he calls a Safer Schools Best Practices Clearinghouse so local districts can easily communicate and share about what's working – and what is not.
Biden wants to make clear that he is willing to use the full weight of the federal government to help get people back to work safely. For example, he will reiterate today that he would direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to set tougher workplace safety standards and pursue large fines on corporations that either do not abide by these stricter standards or "recklessly expose" their workers to the coronavirus. This is a very different approach from Republicans, who want to limit liability for companies in the event their employees get sick to give them the confidence to reopen.
Testing and contact tracing will be major focuses of Biden's remarks this afternoon. The Democratic candidate will emphasize that he wants to "guarantee regular, reliable, free access to testing for every worker called back on the job." He vows to hire "at least" 100,000 workers to build a national case-tracking system. Biden remains willing to invoke the Defense Production Act to require manufacturers to produce more personal protective equipment. And he calls for appointing a "commander" to oversee national supply chains before an expected second wave hits.
Biden has not outlined in detail either how much how all this would cost nor how exactly he would pay for it. But he suggested during a virtual fundraiser on Monday afternoon that he would "get rid of the bulk" of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, close several other "loopholes," raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, change how capital gains are taxed and crack down on tax avoidance schemes.
One reason Trump has taken his foot off the gas on coronavirus relief spending is growing concern among some conservatives inside the White House and on Capitol Hill about the skyrocketing debt. The federal budget deficit has exploded into 10-figures partly because Trump's 2017 tax cuts have failed to generate the promised growth in revenue. 
Vincent Mai, the founder and chairman of private equity firm Cranemere, asked Biden during the fundraiser how he would balance the short-term requirements to address the crisis with the long-term investments that the nation needs to make. Biden answered that "relief and recovery" are "intertwined," and that the recovery can be used as "an opportunity" to build a "stronger, more inclusive middle class."
"Folks, this is going to be really hard work and Donald Trump has made it much harder to foot the bill," Biden said. "We have to think as big as the challenges we face. … I think people are ready to do things that they weren't before, and I think we can significantly grow the economy, grow the GDP, but also do it in a way that we provide dignity for people."
In his speech, Biden will attack Trump for turning his public focus away from the virus. The president has stopped holding regular briefings. Last Friday's coronavirus task force update was relegated to the offices of the Health and Human Services Department, instead of the White House. And Trump skipped it.
"He has refused to wear a mask in public and has held two large rallies — both circumstances that run counter to the advice of health officials, including those in his administration," Annie Linskey reports. "The president also has offered unproven and at times dangerous ideas on how to address the coronavirus, including promoting a drug now believed to be ineffective and suggesting that the virus could be treated via 'an injection inside' the body with a disinfectant. 
"Trump also said at a rally that he had instructed officials to 'slow the testing down' as a way to keep the country's official data on infections lower. In March the president said, 'I don't take responsibility at all' for lagging coronavirus testing in the United States. Biden last week hit Trump for his administration's decision to ask the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act, saying the action risked the lives of Americans who rely on the insurance."
Biden's approach is also designed to establish a contrast with Senate Republicans. The former senator, leading in nationwide and battleground state polling, feels increasingly hopeful that Democrats could win control of the upper chamber if he has long enough coattails. This would make governing much easier if he wins, something he surely remembers well from his first two years as vice president.
"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday to immediately start negotiations on a new coronavirus relief bill," Erica Werner reports. "Senate Republicans and the White House have been eyeing late July as the time frame for putting together another coronavirus bill, after passing four bills in March and April pumping about $3 trillion into the economy. The Democratic-led House passed another massive relief bill 45 days ago, but Republicans declared it dead on arrival in the Senate and Trump threatened to veto it. Congress is in session this week, but lawmakers then plan to leave Washington for a two-week recess for the Fourth of July. There are no plans to pass coronavirus legislation before the recess."
McConnell said Friday in Kentucky that, "if there's a final rescue package," it will be developed by his office later next month. "So we will sit down in July and figure out what seems to fit the way forward based on the conditions a few weeks from now," the majority leader said. "One thing I can tell you will certainly be in the bill — it's not negotiable — [is] liability protection for hospitals, doctors, nurses, businesses, universities [and] K-12 related to the coronavirus."
On a party line vote, House Democrats advanced a bill to spend more than $100 billion in emergency rental assistance and homeowner assistance. It would include a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, plus billions for fighting coronavirus outbreaks among homeless people. But the Senate has no plans to take it up. 
Some veteran lawmakers are worried that the two sides will not be able to bridge their differences to pass something, even later this summer. "Every day we're closer to the election, every day bipartisan legislation gets harder," Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a longtime member of the Appropriations Committee, told Erica. "But the reality is we need another coronavirus bipartisan package to put the funds we need for vaccines and research, more money in public health, assistance to businesses, encouragement for people to go back to work with appropriate protections. All those things are going to require, again, us to work together. And right now, since we've passed that fourth package, we've been pulling apart rather than pulling together."
Scientists are still trying to understand why a more dangerous coronavirus mutation has taken over the world. "Of the approximately 50,000 genomes of the new virus that researchers worldwide have uploaded to a shared database, about 70 percent carry the mutation, officially designated D614G but known more familiarly to scientists as 'G,'" Sarah Kaplan and Joel Achenbach report. "At least four laboratory experiments suggest that the mutation makes the virus more infectious, although none of that work has been peer-reviewed. Another unpublished study led by scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory asserts that patients with the G variant actually have more virus in their bodies, making them more likely to spread it to others. The mutation doesn't appear to make people sicker, but a growing number of scientists worry that it has made the virus more contagious."
As outbreaks worsen in the South and West, Trump's press secretary says they're just "embers." "U.S. deaths are approaching 125,000, and the total number of coronavirus cases reported topped 2.5 million amid worsening outbreaks in Florida, Texas and Arizona," Anne Gearan, Brittany Shammas and Lateshia Beachum report. "Jacksonville, the largest city in Florida and host of the Republican National Convention in late August, announced Monday that masks will be mandatory in public and indoor locations. ... It is not clear whether the requirement will remain in force at the time of the convention or whether Trump and attendees would abide by it. … Jacksonville city spokeswoman Nikki Kimbleton told The Post that whether the mandate applies to the convention will be addressed 'as we get closer to the event,' noting that it is still two months away. … [Vice President] Pence conferred with governors and others out of sight of news cameras Monday and plans to travel to Florida and Arizona, two of the states with spiking cases, for meetings this week with governors and health teams. … 
"Arizona saw another record high in hospitalizations days after Trump visited the state for a raucous indoor rally where almost no one wore a mask. … Florida's rolling seven-day average has risen by 102 percent since a week ago, an increase second only to Louisiana, where the seven-day average is 123 percent higher than that of a week ago. … The surging number of cases could result in nearly half the country infected with the virus by the end of this year, and overall deaths are likely to return to more than 1,000 a day, according to former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb."
A top doctor at the CDC said the U.S. has "way too much virus" to control it. "We're not in the situation of New Zealand or Singapore or Korea where a new case is rapidly identified and all the contacts are traced and people are isolated who are sick and people who are exposed are quarantined and they can keep things under control," Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association's Howard Bauchner. "We have way too much virus across the country for that right now, so it's very discouraging. … This is really the beginning." (CNBC )
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) refuses to order a statewide mask mandate despite the surge on his watch, leaving that decision up to local leaders. (Local 10) Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) pushed back plans to reopen public schools and banned gatherings of more than 50 people. He also closed down bars, nightclubs, movie theaters and water parks, warning residents "we can't be under any illusion that this virus is going to go away on its own." Other hard-hit states, such as Tennessee and Georgia , opted to extend their stay-at-home orders.

Meanwhile, city and county leaders asked Abbott for authority to implement local stay-at-home orders, stressing concerns abut hospital capacity.

Millions track the spread on John Hopkins's dashboard. But those who built it say some miss the real story.  "Since launching in January, the university's Coronavirus Resource Center has exploded in scope and popularity, garnering millions of page views and popping up in news coverage and daily conversation. Through numbers, the tracker has told the story of what the virus is doing while the story is still unfolding, offering a nearly real-time picture of its silent march across the globe," Kyle Swenson reports. "But even as data has jumped to the forefront of international discussions about the virus, the Johns Hopkins team wrestles with doubts about whether the numbers can truly capture the scope of the pandemic, and whether the public and policymakers are failing to absorb the big picture. They know what they are producing is not a high-resolution snapshot of the pandemic but a constantly shifting Etch a Sketch of the trail of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Case counts are consistently inconsistent. Reporting practices differ from country to country, state to state, even county to county. If authorities fail to contextualize the virus with other factors — such as Zip codes, race or Medicaid usage — the hardest-hit communities can go unseen."
Despite his denials, Trump received information about the suspected Russian effort to kill U.S. troops. He did nothing.  "Leading Republican lawmakers on Monday confirmed that U.S. intelligence agencies have developed information about a Russian military operation targeting U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan. But they said that any U.S. response should wait until intelligence agencies fully review the material, some of which was shared with members of Congress in a classified briefing at the White House. Current and former intelligence officials familiar with the intelligence said it was less ambiguous than White House officials and some lawmakers have portrayed and indicated that Russian military intelligence had offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants who killed U.S. military personnel," Ellen Nakashima, Shane Harris, Karen DeYoung and Greg Miller report. "In a statement Monday evening, CIA Director Gina Haspel did not address the intelligence directly, nor did she dispute reports that it showed the Russians targeting U.S. forces. … Without mentioning Russia or Afghan militants by name, Haspel said, 'Hostile states' use of proxies in war zones to inflict damage on U.S. interests and troops is a constant, longstanding concern.' … 
" The intelligence was considered significant and credible enough that it was included in the President's Daily Brief , according to two individuals familiar with the matter … Some officials think the Russian operation led to the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from captured militants in recent months. … Within the intelligence agencies, there remains some disagreement about the credibility of all the sources … It's not unusual for agencies to disagree about some pieces of information and even question the accuracy of a source but still agree that the intelligence points toward a particular conclusion. Trump dismissed the intelligence reports and said he was never told … 
" Former intelligence officials said it was unusual not to inform the president about threats to U.S. forces, even if the information was still being assessed. They also noted reports that the United States shared the intelligence with British officials, given that their forces also were thought to have been targeted. Trump should have been briefed in case the issue came up in conversation with the British prime minister … Britain has nearly 1,000 troops in Afghanistan and has a close intelligence relationship with the United States. Officials there are said to be particularly interested in whether the Russian intelligence unit said to have spearheaded the bounty program is the same one that orchestrated the 2018 poisoning in the English city of Salisbury of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military officer and double agent for British intelligence, and his daughter."
The New York Times specifies that an item on the Russian operation appeared in the PDB on Feb. 27 : "Moreover, a description of the intelligence assessment that the Russian unit had carried out the bounties plot was also seen as serious and solid enough to disseminate more broadly across the intelligence community in a May 4 article in the C.I.A.'s World Intelligence Review, a classified compendium commonly referred to as The Wire, two officials said. … Late Monday, John Ratcliffe, the recently confirmed director of national intelligence, issued a statement warning that leaks about the matter were a crime." (Feb. 27 was also the day Trump met with right-wing Internet personalities Diamond & Silk at the White House.)
The Associated Press reports the White House has been aware that Russia was secretly offering bounties to the Taliban to kill Americans since early 2019. The intelligence assessment was included in at least one of Trump's written briefings at the time, officials said. Then-national security adviser John Bolton also told colleagues he briefed Trump on the issue back in March 2019. 
The Daily Beast reports that, when intelligence about the Russian bounties emerged earlier this year, intelligence and national security leaders didn't brief the president orally and in person because officials are generally reluctant to push information they know he'll resist. Felicia Arculeo, the mother of a Marine killed in action last year in Afghanistan, wants an investigation into reports that her son, Cpl. Robert Hendriks, and two other Marines may have been the targets of Taliban-linked fighters who collected Russian bounties. (CNBC) "Ignorance isn't exculpatory," said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who lost her legs while flying a combat mission over Iraq, on Trump's failure to retaliate against Russia for allegedly offering bounties to kill U.S. troops. (HuffPost)
Trump's phone calls with Vladimir Putin and other autocrats have deeply alarmed many top U.S. officials. If you read just one story today, make it Watergate legend Carl Bernstein's deep dive for CNN: "In hundreds of highly classified phone calls with foreign heads of state, [Trump] was so consistently unprepared for discussion of serious issues, so often outplayed in his conversations with powerful leaders like [Putin] and Turkish President Recep Erdogan, and so abusive to leaders of America's principal allies, that the calls helped convince some senior US officials – including his former secretaries of state and defense, two national security advisers and his longest-serving chief of staff -- that the President himself posed a danger to the national security of the United States, according to White House and intelligence officials intimately familiar with the contents of the conversations. … The sources said there was little evidence that the President became more skillful or competent in his telephone conversations with most heads of state over time. … 
" Putin 'just outplays' him, said a high-level administration official -- comparing the Russian leader to a chess grandmaster and Trump to an occasional player of checkers. While Putin 'destabilizes the West,' said this source, the President of the United States 'sits there and thinks he can build himself up enough as a businessman and tough guy that Putin will respect him.' (At times, the Putin-Trump conversations sounded like 'two guys in a steam bath,' a source added.) … In separate interviews, two high-level administration officials familiar with most of the Trump-Putin calls said the President naively elevated Russia – a second-rate totalitarian state with less than 4% of the world's GDP."
Republicans once again were asked why they've allowed Trump to be so feckless in the face of Russian bellicosity.  "Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) called the reports 'deeply troubling' and said he wanted the Senate to pass his legislation that would require the State Department to consider naming Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who like Gardner is in a tough reelection race this fall, similarly called for the U.S. government to treat Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism," Seung Min Kim reports. "Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.), a former intelligence officer in the Marines, said the Russia-financed bounty effort, if confirmed, 'deserves a strong and immediate response from our government.' … The reaction from congressional Republicans on Monday was markedly different than the comments from Trump, who dismissed the reports as 'possibly another fabricated Russia Hoax' … Left largely unaddressed in many GOP senators' public comments, however, was Trump's role in the matter and what he should do now, with few questions from Senate Republicans on Monday about the White House's contention that the president was left in the dark about an intelligence issue that had prompted a restricted high-level White House meeting in late March. … 'Well, I think the president can't single-handedly remember everything, I'm sure, that he's briefed on, but the intelligence officials are familiar with it and briefed him,' said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.)."
GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee have skipped all but one of the panel's public and private proceedings since before Congress went into lockdown in early March. (Politico) China enacted its Hong Kong security law stripping the territory of autonomy. "China on Tuesday adopted a contentious national security law that will allow Beijing to override Hong Kong's judicial system and target political opponents in the city, stripping the territory of autonomy promised under the handover agreement with Britain and raising the prospect of further retaliation from Washington," Eva Dou and Shibani Mahtani report. "The move has strained China's relations with the United States and other Western nations, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying on Friday that Washington would place visa restrictions on Chinese officials responsible for curtailing freedoms in Hong Kong. On Monday, China said it would impose reciprocal measures on unspecified American officials, while the Commerce Department suspended some of Hong Kong's preferential trade treatment under U.S. law."
As opioids flooded tribal lands, overdose deaths skyrocketed.  "At the height of the opioid epidemic, Native Americans overdosed and died at a rate that rivaled some of the hardest-hit regions in Appalachia. Nationwide, from 2006 to 2014, Native Americans were nearly 50 percent more likely to die of an opioid overdose than non-natives," Sari Horwitz, Debbie Cenziper and Steven Rich report from Ada, Okla. "As more than 3,000 cities and counties — along with most states — pursue billions in settlement dollars from opioid manufacturers and distributors, tribal leaders are fighting for a fair share of the proceeds through a series of lawsuits filed by Indian tribes. Several of the tribes that have sued are in Oklahoma, home to more than 482,000 Native Americans in 38 federally recognized tribes, including the Cherokee, Choctaw and Chickasaw nations. The patchwork of tribal lands is spread across most of the state's 77 counties. Here, the opioid death rate for Native Americans from 2006 to 2014 was more than three times higher than the nationwide rate for non-natives, the analysis of federal health data shows. And within the state, Native Americans were about 50 percent more likely to die than non-natives."
Chief Justice John Roberts's reasserted himself in Monday's Supreme Court decision on abortion.  "Monday's ruling on abortion showed that restrictions on a woman's right to the procedure for now will go only as far as the chief justice allows," Robert Barnes reports. "In Monday's decision, he said the court's allegiance to honoring its past decisions meant striking down a Louisiana law almost identical to one from Texas that the court said in 2016 was unconstitutional. The twist is that Roberts was a dissenter then. The votes do not mean that Roberts, nominated by President George W. Bush, has had an ideological conversion. But they do serve as a reminder of his 2018 rejoinder to Trump that 'we do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.' Roberts's admirers speculate he was turned off by the attempt to have the court's 2016 decision overturned because the court's membership had changed with Trump's two appointments. … 'I find it hard to explain his body of work without some theory that he's playing a long political game,' said Daniel Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. 'He wants to push the law to the right, but is extremely careful not to do things that will make the court too much of a political focal point, and thus hurt its ability to shape the law longer-term.'"
A divided court on Tuesday endorsed a Montana tax incentive program that indirectly helps private religious schools , a major victory for those who want to see more public funding of religious institutions. Roberts, writing for a conservative 5 to 4 majority, said the Montana Supreme Court was wrong to strike down the program because of a provision in the state constitution that forbids public funds from going to religious institutions. The U.S. Constitution's protection of religious freedom prevails, he said. (Barnes)
Trump's 'white power' tweet set off a White House scramble. But the president has not condemned the comment. "The president shared a video on Twitter that included a Trump supporter shouting 'white power' at counterprotesters during a demonstration," Ashley Parker and Toluse Olorunnipa report. "Senior staffers quickly conferred over the phone and then began trying to reach the president to convey their concerns about the tweet. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, son-in-law Jared Kushner and other senior advisers spoke with president … Roughly three hours later, the president gave the go-ahead to delete his incendiary tweet … But neither the president nor his team publicly condemned the racist phrase, setting off another controversial news cycle … Speaking on 'Fox & Friends' Monday morning, McEnany said Trump hadn't heard the 'white power' shout but never condemned the language, saying, 'His point in tweeting out that video was to stand with his supporters, who are oftentimes demonized.'" 
Congress launched a probe into federal officers' use of force on Lafayette Square protesters.  "The hearings before the House Natural Resources Committee were the first of several, with lawmakers signaling they have more questions about the types of weapons used and whether federal police officers issued verbal warnings before launching stun grenades and chemical irritants into the crowd," Marissa Lang reports. "No members of the Trump administration were called to testify. Park Police officials, who led the charge against protesters on June 1, declined to attend, lawmakers said."

Full text: At least 13,000 have been hospitalized
Communities of color are especially hit hard On Friday, 85 days after the novel coronavirus appeared in the Washington region, the number of known infections in D.C., Maryland and Virginia surpassed 100,000. That means six in every 1,000 residents have tested positive for the virus. At least 13,000 patients have been hospitalized, according to state data, and 4,284 have died.
This milestone comes as several of the region's hardest-hit localities lift months-old restrictions, taking tentative steps toward resuming social and commercial life. The vigorous debate over reopening is a reminder that the virus has affected virtually everyone in the region. But these 102,059 patients have been touched by the virus in the most direct way.
"It's surreal," said Titou Phommachanh, 44, one of Northern Virginia's first critically ill covid-19 patients. The father of two was admitted to Inova Fairfax Hospital, where his condition rapidly declined, in early March. After spending nearly three weeks in a coma, Phommachanh woke up to a different world, he said - "a covid world," where what happened to him was no longer a freak incident but a familiar story unfolding across the region to hundreds of people.
"The shocking part of it all," said Phommachanh, now recovered and at home with his family, "is how quickly it's been able to spread."
As case numbers mounted over the past 11 weeks, so did pressure on government agencies to release more data on infections and deaths. Health departments started publishing demographic information, then added Zip codes and localities, providing a partial portrait of who these patients are, where they live, and how they contracted the disease.
Slightly more women have tested positive than men, but ⁠ - as is the case nationally - more men have died. In Maryland and Virginia, residents above the age of 40 make up about 60 percent of cases. In the District, 72 percent of infections were found in residents 35 and older. But that does not mean children have been spared: Across the three jurisdictions, at least 7,000 patients have been younger than 19.
Communities of color have been disproportionately affected by the virus, mirroring national trends.
Of 931 Zip codes in Maryland and Virginia analyzed by The Washington Post, the highest infection rates per capita were found in communities that are predominantly African American and Latino. In the District, about 58 percent of known infections were in communities where African Americans are the majority. The three neighborhoods with the highest rates per capita - Stadium-Armory, Brightwood Park and Saint Elizabeths - are predominantly African American.
In the Stadium-Armory neighborhood east of Capitol Hill, which is 83 percent African American, 356 of every 5,000 residents have tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the highest rate in the District. This is partially because the neighborhood is home to the D.C. jail, where more than 200 people have tested positive.
Patients cluster around densely populated areas. Of the known infections, 79 percent were diagnosed in urban and populous suburban areas, including the District, Baltimore, Northern Virginia, Virginia Beach and Richmond. The Washington metro area makes up 60 percent of infections in the District, Maryland and Virginia.
The virus first appeared in the region on March 5, with three Montgomery County residents who were infected while traveling overseas. Within days, cases emerged in Virginia and in the District, including the city's patient zero, the Rev. Timothy Cole of Christ Church Georgetown. Health officials urged calm, pointing out that all the early cases were linked to travel or known contact with an existing patient. But by the second week of March, the evidence of community spread was clear. Schools were shuttered and large gatherings banned.
The number of known infections spiked most sharply in April, increasing from 4,000 to 40,000 in 30 days. The region went from adding roughly 500 new patients a day to 2,000 before the figure started to plateau.
The pandemic's spread was fueled in large part by outbreaks in nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and jails - what government officials call congregate settings. Despite early lockdowns at these facilities, the virus was passed along by asymptomatic carriers, infecting more than 17,500 staff and residents and accounting for nearly a fifth of the total caseload in the three jurisdictions.
In Montgomery County, 6 of 10 covid-19 deaths are linked to long-term care facilities. In neighboring Prince George's County, such fatalities represent 40 percent of deaths. Prince George's officials say a bigger driver of infections and deaths in the suburb of 900,000 is rampant community spread, particularly among residents who are working in essential services.
In Maryland and Virginia, the most prominent jobs in communities with the highest cases per resident are tied to educational services, health care, waste management and social assistance, census data shows. That was followed by communities with high percentages of residents in construction and manufacturing.
In Montgomery County, at least 18 firefighters and trainees and approximately eight sworn police officers have contracted the virus. One of the earliest was Capt. Larry Lofland, 56, who tested positive in mid-March, along with his wife Kristie, a kindergarten teacher. Lofland is not sure when he was exposed; it could have been as early as March 7, he said, when his paramedic duties took him inside two hospitals.
"That was so early in all this," said Lofland, who has since recovered and helped to treat other covid-19 patients. "One hundred thousand cases - that number is overwhelming to me."
In D.C., 239 firefighters and police officers have tested positive for the virus, including Assistant Fire Chief John Donnelly, 53, who learned on March 23 that he had contracted the disease that was beginning to terrorize his city.
"My initial reaction was, 'Wow, this could be it,' " Donnelly said.
For nine days, Donnelly slept from sundown to sun up, and his appetite disappeared. Since recovering, Donnelly has used his experience to inform the agency and other colleagues, donating his antibody-rich plasma to research and corralling other firefighters to do the same.
Those who survive the disease say they feel tied by a bond similar to the one that connects first responders and civilians who survive major crashes, fires or tragedies like 9/11. Donnelly said he has received well wishes from strangers in his neighborhood and from his son's Boy Scout troops. Phommachanh said he has heard from dozens of families, asking about his experience with the drug remdesivir and seeking hope for loved ones in critical care.
"Everyone I talk to, there is a connection," Donnelly said. "Even though we are isolated, I've seen our community come together."
As government officials inch toward reopening, the virus continues to spread, with 8,955 new infections announced since Memorial Day. Some scientists say it may never go away, even with a vaccine.
Models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington suggest that it may take till mid-June for new daily infections in D.C., Maryland and Virginia to drop to the levels they were in March, though experts have warned against relying too heavily on these projections. It is certain that there will be more patients, but the exact figure depends on how residents behave in the coming months.
Allison Rule, a 46-year-old lawyer from Chevy Chase and one of the first 100 Maryland residents to test positive, said she deleted the Facebook app off her phone after reading posts from people incorrectly calling the coronavirus a Democratic hoax.
"As someone who had it, I take it really personally," she said. "It's not make-believe."
Rule didn't end up on a ventilator or in the hospital but said she is still grappling with the stress that came from testing positive. She and her husband didn't realize their 10-year-old daughter understood what had happened until one recent night, when the girl told Rule, "I stay up at night to make sure you're not coughing."
Even as parts of Maryland reopen, Rule said, her family intends to continue staying at home.
The impacts of covid-19 are lasting. Some patients suffer permanent damage to their lungs, which may make them more susceptible to future respiratory illnesses. Others emerge with weakened kidneys, hearts or livers, dulled senses, or other mysterious symptoms.
Lofland, the Montgomery firefighter, said that there are entire days from the period he was battling the virus that he cannot remember. Sharrarne Morton, a Prince George's County resident, lost 25 pounds and two dress sizes during her five-week bout with the virus. Weeks after being discharged from the hospital, she still has not gotten her appetite back.
Phommachanh returned home nearly two months ago and still has some lingering nerve damage in his hand - a tingling, sometimes shooting pain from his ring finger to his pinkie finger. The sensation comes and goes, he said, a reminder of the virus's mark on his body.

Full text: On Friday, 85 days after the novel coronavirus appeared in the Washington region, the number of known infections in D.C., Maryland and Virginia surpassed 100,000. That means six in every 1,000 residents have tested positive for the virus. At least 13,000 patients have been hospitalized, according to state data, and 4,284 have died.
This milestone comes as several of the region's hardest-hit localities lift months-old restrictions, taking tentative steps toward resuming social and commercial life. The vigorous debate over reopening is a reminder that the virus has affected virtually everyone in the region. But these 102,059 patients have been touched by covid-19 in the most direct way.
"It's surreal," said Titou Phommachanh, 44, one of Northern Virginia's first critically ill covid-19 patients. The father of two was admitted to Inova Fairfax Hospital, where his condition rapidly declined, in early March. After spending nearly three weeks in a coma, Phommachanh woke up to a different world, he said — "a covid world," where what happened to him was no longer a freak incident but a familiar story unfolding across the region to hundreds of people.
"The shocking part of it all," said Phommachanh, now recovered and at home with his family, "is how quickly it's been able to spread."
As case numbers mounted over the past 11 weeks, so did pressure on government agencies to release more data on infections and deaths. Health departments started publishing demographic information, then added Zip codes and localities, providing a partial portrait of who these patients are, where they live, and how they contracted the disease.
Slightly more women have tested positive than men, but ⁠ — as is the case nationally — more men have died. In Maryland and Virginia, residents above the age of 40 make up about 60 percent of cases. In the District, 72 percent of infections were found in residents 35 and older. But that does not mean children have been spared from the disease: Across the three jurisdictions, at least 7,000 patients have been younger than 19.
Communities of color have been disproportionately affected by the virus, mirroring national trends.
Of 931 Zip codes in Maryland and Virginia analyzed by The Washington Post, the highest infection rates per capita were found in communities that are predominantly African American and Latino. In the District, about 58 percent of known infections were in communities where African Americans are the majority. The three neighborhoods with the highest rates per capita — Stadium-Armory, Brightwood Park and Saint Elizabeths — are predominantly African American.
In the Stadium-Armory neighborhood east of Capitol Hill, which is 83 percent African American, 356 of every 5,000 residents have tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the highest rate in the District. This is partially because the neighborhood is home to the D.C. jail, where more than 200 people have tested positive.
Patients cluster around densely populated areas. Of the known infections, 79 percent were diagnosed in urban and populous suburban areas, including the District, Baltimore, Northern Virginia, Virginia Beach and Richmond. The Washington metro area makes up 60 percent of infections in the District, Maryland and Virginia.
The virus first appeared in the region on March 5, with three Montgomery County residents who were infected while traveling overseas. Within days, cases emerged in Virginia and in the District, including the city's patient zero, the Rev. Timothy Cole of Christ Church Georgetown. Health officials urged calm, pointing out that all the early cases were linked to travel or known contact with an existing patient. But by the second week of March, the evidence of community spread was clear. Schools were shuttered and large gatherings banned.
The number of known infections spiked most sharply in April, increasing from 4,000 to 40,000 in 30 days. The region went from adding roughly 500 new patients a day to 2,000 before the figure started to plateau.
The pandemic's spread was fueled in large part by outbreaks in nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and jails — what government officials call congregate settings. Despite early lockdowns at these facilities, the virus was passed along by asymptomatic carriers, infecting more than 17,500 staff and residents and accounting for nearly a fifth of the total caseload in the three jurisdictions.
In Montgomery County, 6 of 10 covid-19 deaths are linked to long-term care facilities. In neighboring Prince George's County, such fatalities represent 40 percent of deaths. Prince George's officials say a bigger driver of infections and deaths in the suburb of 900,000 is rampant community spread, particularly among residents who are working in essential services.
In Maryland and Virginia, the most prominent jobs in communities with the highest cases per resident are tied to educational services, health care, waste management and social assistance, census data shows. That was followed by communities with high percentages of residents in construction and manufacturing.
In Montgomery County, at least 18 firefighters and trainees and approximately eight sworn police officers have contracted the virus. One of the earliest was Capt. Larry Lofland, 56, who tested positive in mid-March, along with his wife Kristie, a kindergarten teacher. Lofland is not sure when he was exposed; it could have been as early as March 7, he said, when his paramedic duties took him inside two hospitals.
"That was so early in all this," said Lofland, who has since recovered and helped to treat other covid-19 patients. "One hundred thousand cases — that number is overwhelming to me."
In D.C., 239 firefighters and police officers have tested positive for the virus, including Assistant Fire Chief John Donnelly, 53, who learned on March 23 that he had contracted the disease that was beginning to terrorize his city.
"My initial reaction was, 'Wow, this could be it,' " Donnelly said.
For nine days, Donnelly slept from sundown to sun up, and his appetite disappeared. Since recovering, Donnelly has used his experience to inform the agency and other colleagues, donating his antibody-rich plasma to research and corralling other firefighters to do the same.
Those who survive the disease say they feel tied by a bond similar to the one that connects first responders and civilians who survive major crashes, fires or tragedies like 9/11. Donnelly said he has received well wishes from strangers in his neighborhood and from his son's Boy Scout troops. Phommachanh said he has heard from dozens of families, asking about his experience with the drug Remdesivir and seeking hope for loved ones in critical care.
"Everyone I talk to, there is a connection," Donnelly said. "Even though we are isolated, I've seen our community come together."

Full text: Columbia University epidemiologists estimate in a new study that enacting social distancing measures a week earlier, on March 8 instead of March 15, could have saved up to 36,000 lives in the United States.   That's about 40 percent of the current reported fatalities from the novel coronavirus. The study found that imposing the social distancing measures on March 1 that would ultimately go into effect two weeks later could have saved about 54,000 American lives.
At least 92,317 deaths from the virus have been reported in the United States since Feb. 29.
The White House responded to Columbia's research with a statement that attacked the Chinese government and the World Health Organization for not being more transparent while praising President Trump for showing "bold leadership."
The Columbia study is one of several fresh data points that illustrate the cascading fallout from the contagion and the continuing challenges for the response at home and abroad.
The United States is on track to reach 113,000 deaths by mid-June.  Biostatistician Nicholas Reich from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and colleagues have developed an "ensemble" model that incorporates 20 other pandemic models. It shows a gradual decline in projected deaths, from about 9,000 this week to 4,000 in the second week of June. But Reich's team and other experts emphasize that it's really hard to model the next few weeks as states reopen because they don't know how much people will continue to socially distance, and there's lag time between infection and showing symptoms and hospitalizations.
The number of confirmed cases worldwide surpassed 5 million overnight. More than 1.5 million of them are in the United States. The WHO said Wednesday that more than 100,000 new infections were reported over the previous 24 hours, which made for the highest single-day total since the outbreak began. "We still have a long way to go in this pandemic," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.
The Labor Department announced this morning that 2.4 million Americans sought jobless benefits last week, bringing the nine-week total to 38.6 million.  The weekly report comes as Trump and congressional Republicans move to cut off enhanced unemployment benefits that will otherwise expire in July. "At issue is the enhanced unemployment aid that Congress approved in late March, which includes an extra $600 in weekly payments to out-of-work Americans. On Tuesday, President Trump articulated his reluctance to extend those benefits during a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans, many of whom share his concern that the expanded federal payments deter people from returning to work," Tony Romm and Jeff Stein report. "Top congressional Republicans signaled support for paring back these benefits during a meeting on Tuesday attended by Vice President Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) … Party leaders also agreed to delay another round of coronavirus aid for three to four weeks …
"McConnell then told House lawmakers on Wednesday that Republicans had to 'clean up the Democrats' crazy policy that is paying people more to remain unemployed than they would earn if they went back to work,' according to a person familiar with the remarks, which were first reported by Politico. McConnell added of extending the unemployment increase: 'This will not be in the next bill.'"
A research team that uses cellphone data to track social mobility and forecast the virus's trajectory is warning that Dallas, Houston, Southeast Florida's Gold Coast, the entire state of Alabama and several other Southern places that have been rapidly reopening their economies are in danger of a second wave of infections over the next month. The model developed by PolicyLab at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, updated last night, suggests that most U.S. communities should be able to avoid a second spike in the near term if residents maintain social distancing even as restrictions are eased. "But the risk for resurgence is high in some parts of the country, especially in places where cases are already rising fast, including the counties of Crawford, Iowa; Colfax, Neb.; and Texas, Okla. and the city of Richmond," Joel Achenbach, Rachel Weiner, Karin Brulliard and Isaac Stanley-Becker report:
" A presentation prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency — and reviewed by The Post — suggests new waves could be steep enough in some places to overwhelm ventilator capacity. For instance, the data indicates that only 866 ventilators are in use in Georgia, which has pursued one of the most aggressive reopening plans. But the state's supply of 2,853 ventilators could be outstripped as soon as the end of the month by the projected number required for covid-19 patients, according to the federal modeling. States from Arizona to Colorado to Tennessee could face similar shortages … 
" Alabama will probably experience a steep increase in cases in nearly every county over the next month , according to the PolicyLab model. … Gov. Kay Ivey (R), who has allowed restaurants, bars, retail businesses, churches, gyms and salons to reopen, is expected to outline further steps this week. In a news conference Wednesday, Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said the city is facing a shortage of intensive care beds and being forced to divert patients to Birmingham. 'They're at a capacity that is not sustainable,' he said. 'Our health-care system is maxed out.'"
Nearly 860,000 additional travelers flocked to parts of Maryland and Virginia over the weekend. Many from the Washington suburbs went to the parts of those states that began to reopen Friday, according to researchers tracking smartphone data at the University of Maryland. "The increase in travel, including from coronavirus hot spots, underscores concerns among public health experts that piecemeal lifting of restrictions increases the chances of the virus spreading," Katherine Shaver reports. "They say they're particularly concerned about rural areas , where there have been fewer cases, as people travel from closed areas to those that have reopened. 'It's a really bad scenario,' said Lei Zhang, lead researcher on the University of Maryland's project."

Front-line health-care workers still don't have all the critical equipment they need.  Washington Post-Ipsos polling released yesterday showed that nearly two-thirds of front-line health-care workers have insufficient supplies of the face masks that filter out most airborne particles. The poll was in the field from April 27 to May 4. "More than 4 in 10 also saw shortages of less protective surgical masks and 36 percent said their supply of hand sanitizer was running low," Lenny Bernstein and Alauna Safarpour report. "Roughly 8 in 10 reported wearing one mask for an entire shift, and more than 7 in 10 had to wear the same mask more than once. The dire shortage of personal protective equipment for health-care workers emerged in March as one of the earliest signals of the country's lack of preparation for the coronavirus pandemic." A 59 percent majority disapproved of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, while 41 percent approved.
The federal watchdog who was sidelined after she issued an early report documenting acute shortages of personal protective equipment at overwhelmed hospitals will testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Tuesday. "Christi A. Grimm, the principal deputy inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services, documented 'severe shortages' of supplies in late March and described hospitals' intense frustration with government authorities who were unequipped to address the scarcity," Mike DeBonis reports. "After Grimm issued her report on April 3, President Trump criticized her … On May 1, Trump nominated a permanent HHS inspector general to replace Grimm — one of several moves he has made to oust inspectors general who served Barack Obama and previous presidents."
The World Bank estimates that 3 billion people around the world do not have access to clean water and soap to wash their hands . The bank is working with countries and humanitarian groups to expand access to fixed and portable hand-washing facilities, soap or alcohol-based hand rubs and reliable water supplies to avert potential catastrophe in the developing world. "A simple tool to promote public health, handwashing is one of the most effective ways to prevent transmission of disease—not just the coronavirus … but also diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid," according to a recent report from the bank. "Today, 47 percent of schools lack hand-washing facilities with water and soap, affecting 900 million school-age children. And in 16 percent of health care facilities, there are no hand-washing facilities in the areas where patients receive care or near the toilets."
A national poll from the Pew Research Center finds that 16 percent of Americans say they rely more on Trump and the White House for information about covid-19 than any other source, including the local or national media.  Of this group, 72 percent say journalists have been exaggerating the risks of the virus and 73 percent said that coverage has been too negative. "And six-in-ten also have heard a lot about the unproven claim that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could be useful in treating the virus , a higher portion than any other group," according to Pew. "In addition, about half (51%) of those who rely most on Trump and the task force say the outbreak has been made a bigger deal than it really is. … In no other group do more than a third say the coronavirus outbreak has been blown out of proportion; those who rely mainly on public health organizations and officials for coronavirus news are more likely than other groups to say that the outbreak has been underplayed." 
A Carnegie Mellon University study found that nearly half of the accounts spreading messages on Twitter about the contagion are probably bots.  "Researchers culled through more than 200 million tweets since January discussing the virus and found that about 45% were sent by accounts that behave more like computerized robots than humans," NPR reports. "It is too early to say conclusively what individuals or groups are behind the bot accounts, but researchers said the tweets appeared aimed at sowing divisions in America. 'We do know that it looks like it's a propaganda machine, and it definitely matches the Russian and Chinese playbooks , but it would take a tremendous amount of resources to substantiate that,' said Kathleen Carley, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, who is conducting a study into bot-generated coronavirus activity on Twitter that has yet to be published.  
"Researchers identified more than 100 false narratives about COVID-19 that are proliferating on Twitter by accounts controlled by bots.  Among the misinformation disseminated by bot accounts: tweeted conspiracy theories about hospitals being filled with mannequins, or tweets connected the spread of the coronavirus to 5G wireless towers, a notion that is patently untrue. Such bogus ideas on the Internet have caused real-world harm. In England, dozens of wireless towers have been set on fire in acts officials believe have been fueled by false conspiracy theories linking the rollout of 5G technology to the coronavirus. 'We're seeing up to two times as much bot activity as we'd predicted based on previous natural disasters, crises and elections,' Carley said. … Twitter says its automated systems have 'challenged' 1.5 million accounts that were targeting discussions about COVID-19 with malicious or manipulative behavior."
Trump's promise of a "Warp Speed" cure is fueling the anti-vaccine movement.  "Some of the same online activists who have clamored to resume economic activity, echoing Trump's call to 'liberate' their states from sweeping restrictions, are now aligning themselves with a cause on the political fringe — preemptively forswearing a vaccine," Isaac Stanley-Becker reports. "To further their baseless claims about the dangers of vaccines and to portray the scientific process as reckless, they have seized on the brisk pace promised for the project, which the Trump administration has branded 'Operation Warp Speed.' … Both movements represent the views of a small minority of Americans. But leading medical experts fear that the ability of their adherents to spread misinformation online could plant seeds of confusion and distrust in the broader public — and undermine future efforts to distribute a vaccine. … 
" Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he has grown increasingly concerned that the name of the initiative has led to misconceptions about what is being put at risk by speeding up the effort — only financial investments, not safety or efficacy. 'People don't understand that, because when they hear 'Operation Warp Speed,' they think, 'Oh, my God, they're jumping over all these steps and they're going to put us at risk,'' Fauci said in an interview Wednesday with The Washington Post. No steps would be eliminated, he vowed. Rather, multiple steps — from collecting data to preparing to scale up the number of potential doses — would be pursued at once, creating 'risk for the investment' but not for the patient or the 'integrity of the study.'"
Reopening guidance for churches was not issued because of disagreements between the White House and CDC.  The draft guidance "was the subject of much internal debate at the White House last month," Lena Sun, Josh Dawsey and Michelle Boorstein report. "Some aides did not want any guidance for religious institutions. Others thought recommendations were too restrictive. In the end, the decision to hold back reopening guidance for religious institutions came from some White House and coronavirus task force officials who did not want to alienate the faithful and believed that some of the proposals, such as limits on hymnals, the size of choirs or the passing of collection plates, were too restrictive, according to two administration officials." 
Six CDC officials told CNN their agency's efforts to mount a coordinated response to the novel coronavirus outbreak have been hamstrung by a White House whose decisions are driven by politics not science: "The result has worsened the effects of the crisis, sources inside the CDC say. … 'We've been muzzled,' said a current CDC official. 'What's tough is that if we would have acted earlier on what we knew and recommended, we would have saved lives and money.' … A CDC employee said an overarching concern is that the agency's scientific work is taking a back seat to politics. 'The message we received in previous administrations was, you guys are the scientists,' the employee said. 'That's not the case this time. If the science that we are offering up contradicts a specific policy goal, then we are the problem.'"
The CDC has launched a study of the prevalence of virus antibodies in 25 metro areas. The government plans to test 325,000 people by the fall of 2021. By determining who has antibodies, epidemiologists can figure out who has been infected with the virus, even if someone never reported a positive test or even experienced symptoms. (Chelsea Janes)
Testing in the U.S. is "a mess," infectious-disease experts warn. The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota lays out in a new report how testing is not accurate enough to use alone to make most decisions, including who should go back to work or to school. "The data is really kind of screwed up," said Mike Osterholm, head of the institute. "It's not clear if antibody tests are useful for testing of health care workers to determine immune status," CNN notes. "Osterholm noted that some states are combining data from diagnostic tests and antibody tests to make estimates about how many people have been infected. The FDA advises against using tests in this way and so does Osterholm."
Trump has blamed his intelligence briefer for his slow early response. But he hardly pays attention.  "Trump has insisted that the intelligence agencies gave him inadequate warnings about the threat of the virus, describing it as 'not a big deal.' Intelligence officials have publicly backed him, acknowledging that Beth Sanner, the analyst who regularly briefs the president, underplayed the dangers when she first mentioned the virus to him on Jan. 23," the Times reports. "But in blaming Ms. Sanner, a C.I.A. analyst with three decades of experience, Mr. Trump ignored a host of warnings he received around that time from higher-ranking officials, epidemiologists, scientists, biodefense officials, other national security aides and the news media about the virus's growing threat. … [Trump] is particularly difficult to brief on critical national security matters, according to interviews with 10 current and former intelligence officials familiar with his intelligence briefings … He has a short attention span and rarely, if ever, reads intelligence reports... He is unashamed to interrupt intelligence officers … 
"Trump rarely absorbs information that he disagrees with or that runs counter to his worldview, the officials said. Briefing him has been so great a challenge compared with his predecessors that the intelligence agencies have hired outside consultants to study how better to present information to him. Working to keep Mr. Trump's interest exhausted and burned out his first briefer, Ted Gistaro, two former officials said.  … [Joseph Maguire, the former acting director of national intelligence] has told briefers they need to know their audience and understand that Mr. Trump honed his style on reality television, said a former senior intelligence official. … [Sanner] relies on humor and sarcasm to get her point across and will subtly challenge the president."
Government isolation centers helped lower infections in some countries, but they're anathema to the American way of life. "Even as centralized, out-of-home quarantine and isolation appeared helpful in breaking the chain of transmission in other countries, the United States has remained largely resistant to isolating people in government-run centers away from their homes. And in places where voluntary isolation facilities are available, local officials are finding fewer people taking advantage of them than expected. It's a reflection, experts said, of cost and conflicting priorities, of cultural norms and mistrust of government," Chelsea Janes reports. "Americans' suspicions about government intervention also mean large swaths of the population — especially immigrants and people of color who have been subject to government restrictions in the past — are wary of placing their lives in the hands of local officials."
A town in Michigan is battling racial disparities in its coronavirus deaths.  Trump is scheduled to visit a Ford plant today near Ypsilanti, which is in Washtenaw County, where there have been 1,261 confirmed cases and 90 deaths. "Black residents make up 12 percent of the county population, but 34 percent of the confirmed cases. The state is dealing with cataclysms on multiple fronts. Wednesday, it passed a grim milestone, tallying more than 5,000 coronavirus deaths," Moriah Balingit reports. "Though protesters who oppose the state's lockdown rules continue rallying in Lansing — on Wednesday cutting hair on the capitol lawn to protest the restrictions on barbershops — few here are eager to reopen until the virus is contained. Instead, leaders are beginning to look inward, examining the cruel realities and the fault lines that have led to the lopsided death toll. Ypsilanti Mayor Beth Bashert has been frank: 'environmental, systemic and economic racism.'" 
Trump threatened to block federal funds from going to Michigan and Nevada.  Both states have announced plans to increase voting by mail to reduce the public's exposure to the coronavirus. "Without evidence, Trump called the two states' plans 'illegal,' and he incorrectly claimed that Michigan's 'rogue' secretary of state is planning to mail ballots to all voters. The state is planning to send applications for mail-in ballots to all voters — not ballots themselves," Amy Gardner, Josh Dawsey, Jeff Stein and John Wagner report. "Trump later corrected the error and suggested he would not need to withhold federal money, but he did not retreat from his claim that both states are taking steps that will encourage voter fraud. … The president's aggressive and unfounded rhetoric drew immediate rebukes from Democrats and voting rights activists, who accused Trump of intentionally sowing mistrust in U.S. elections. And his claims that absentee voting will encourage cheating are at odds with the activity of state and national GOP leaders, who are mounting aggressive field operations, including mass mailings of ballot applications, to encourage their voters to cast ballots by mail. GOP officeholders in various states — including Nevada — are also backing expansions of absentee voting because of the pandemic." 
The administration is considering extending the deployment of 40,000 National Guard members.  An extension would mean thousands of Guard members could qualify for federal retirement and education benefits, which they would be one day short of getting if their deployment ends in June. Some lawmakers criticized the decision to dismiss the Guard a day short of the 90 days required for federal benefits. "You think they just pulled 89 out of a hat?" said Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), a National Guard captain who was deployed to help set up hospitals in Staten Island. "No. This isn't a coincidence. We're not idiots. This is spitting at our soldiers who have done the right thing." (Politico) 
Congress is reworking the Paycheck Protection Program so businesses have more flexibility.  "House and Senate lawmakers are preparing new legislation that would make it easier for the government to forgive emergency loans to small businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic after a lobbying blitz by firms who argued they needed more assistance," Erica Werner reports. "The bills would give companies more time to use funding under the Paycheck Protection Program, allowing them additional flexibility to rehire workers later this year rather than rush to bring people back by June. It's unclear, though, whether a political compromise to rework the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program is near, even as many businesses argue they are on the verge of shuttering for good."

Trump is considering a Brazil travel ban. "São Paulo, the largest city in the Western Hemisphere, is emerging as the coronavirus pandemic's latest global hot spot. Confirmed cases in the city have soared 34 percent and at least 510 people have died in the past week as the public health infrastructure buckles and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro continues to shrug off the crisis," Marina Lopes reports. "Across Brazil, more than 1,000 people died of the coronavirus on Tuesday alone. The country now ranks third worldwide with 255,000 confirmed cases, trailing only the United States and Russia. … Trump, who has maintained friendly ties with Bolsonaro, a fellow populist, said he was considering banning travel from the country.

As U.S.-China rhetoric grows hotter, new risks emerge – and Taiwan is drawn into the mix.  "In the span of several hours, the feud swung from Taipei to Beijing to the Internet, where an animated 'credibility test' on Chinese state TV's Twitter feed mocked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump then lashed out at China for a 'worldwide killing' from covid-19," Gerry Shih, Eva Dou and Anne Gearan report. "In Taiwan — for decades one of the most sensitive issues between Washington and Beijing — the start of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's second term on Wednesday was overshadowed by the war of words. China issued angry warnings after senior U.S. officials, including Pompeo and deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, sent rare, high-level messages to congratulate Tsai."
Chinese Communist Party officials are also signaling that they plan to take full control of Hong Kong. "The National People's Congress is always an important piece of political pageantry for China's ruling Communist Party. But this year's meeting, which begins Friday after a two-month delay due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, will be more pivotal than usual," Anna Fifield reports. "With the country emerging from the devastating pandemic that began in the city of Wuhan, leader Xi Jinping will seek to show that China is getting back on track and to present the party in the best possible international light — while highlighting the West's coronavirus failures."
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) said Michigan will pursue legal recourse over a failed dam. "As 10,000 residents evacuated the city of Midland, a central Michigan community of about 40,000 people, the river reached a level more than a foot higher than the previous record," Jacob Carah, Frances Stead Sellers, Andrew Freedman and Steven Mufson report. Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy "attributed the disaster to historic rainfall and deferred maintenance at the Edenville Dam, which is owned by Boyce Hydro Power LLC. … Residents of the inundated area, meanwhile, were trying to reach safety Wednesday even as they worried about the coronavirus … 'I've got my mask, I got my gloves, I got my cat and finally got some socks,' said Susan Smith, a retired dance instructor … Like other evacuees, she was trying to heed the governor's advice to prevent the spread of the virus 'to the best of your ability' by wearing masks and following social distancing guidelines." 
A shooter at a recently reopened mall in Arizona wounded at least three.  "A suspect has been taken into custody after police say he opened fire Wednesday night at a shopping center in Glendale, Ariz.," Meagan Flynn reports.

One victim is in critical condition while two others have non-life-threatening injuries, a spokeswoman for the Glendale Police Department said."
The Supreme Court stopped House Democrats from seeing Bob Mueller's grand jury materials – for now. "The court, without noted dissent, agreed to a request from the Justice Department to put on hold a lower court's decision granting the House Judiciary Committee some previously undisclosed material from Mueller's probe," Robert Barnes and Ann Marimow report. "The action could mean that Congress will not receive the full Mueller report — without redactions of certain grand jury material — until after the November election, or perhaps not even during lawmakers' current term, which ends Jan. 3." 
Michael Flynn's name was never masked in an FBI report on his communications with Russia's ambassador, a former senior U.S. official told Ellen Nakashima.

Nine percent of Trump's 2016 voters say they plan to vote for Joe Biden. Analysis by John Halpin and Ruy Teixeira from the Center for American Progress found that the bloc of Trump-Biden voters is twice as large as the percentage of Hillary Clinton voters from 2016 who this year say they plan to vote for Trump. That would give Biden a net advantage that could help decide the 2020 election. 
Bernie Sanders's campaign, seeking to make peace with Biden, asked his delegates to sign agreements "barring attacks on other candidates or party leaders, combative confrontations on social media or talking to reporters without approval," Sean Sullivan scoops.

Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is once again in the U.S. political fray over leaked Biden recordings.   Zelensky called on his law enforcement agencies to investigate leaked audio of private phone calls several years ago between the then-vice president and Ukraine's then-president, Petro Poroshenko, saying the conversations might be "qualified as high treason." "The recordings showed Biden, as he has previously said publicly, linked loan guarantees for Ukraine in 2015 to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, then the country's prosecutor general," David Stern and Isabelle Khurshudyan report. Ukrainian parliament member Andriy Derkach, who has past links to Russian intelligence, claimed the tapes point to Biden's influence on Poroshenko. At no point in the clips does Biden mention his son Hunter or the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. 
On a party-line vote, Senate Republicans on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved a subpoena for documents related to Hunter Biden's work for Burisma. The request generated fierce opposition from Democrats, with some suggesting Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is serving as an unwitting pawn of a Russian disinformation campaign. (Mike DeBonis)

Full text: Three children have died of a mysterious syndrome linked to the virus. Trump’s support among seniors slips as the pandemic becomes more political.
This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic .
Top health officials are quarantining after being exposed.
In the latest sign of worry that the coronavirus could be spreading through the senior ranks of the Trump administration, three top public health officials have begun partial or full self-quarantine for two weeks after coming into contact with someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus.
Representatives for Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, confirmed the precautions on Saturday. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, confirmed a CNN report that he had begun a “modified quarantine” given what he called a “low risk” contact.
The actions come after the disclosure on Friday that Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for the virus. Ms. Miller has attended numerous meetings of the White House’s coronavirus task force, which also includes Dr. Redfield, Dr. Hahn and Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Fauci will telework from home and wear a mask for 14 days, he told CNN, possibly visiting his office at the National Institutes of Health when he will be the only person present. He tested negative for the virus on Friday and plans to be tested daily from now on.
Dr. Redfield also had a “low-risk exposure” with a person at the White House, on May 6, and will be teleworking for the next two weeks, Benjamin Haynes, a C.D.C. spokesman, said in a statement. Dr. Redfield “is feeling fine, and has no symptoms,” he said, adding that if Dr. Redfield needed to visit the White House for official business he would follow C.D.C. safety guidelines for essential workers who may have been exposed to the virus. Those guidelines call for temperature checks, screening for symptoms, masks as well as social distancing.
A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said that Dr. Hahn had sent a note to his staff on Friday disclosing his contact with a person who had tested positive for Covid-19 and that, in accordance with C.D.C. guidelines, “is now in self-quarantine for the next two weeks.”
“Dr. Hahn immediately took a diagnostic test and tested negative for the virus,” added the spokeswoman, Stephanie Caccomo.
She and Mr. Haynes did not identify the person or people to whom Dr. Redfield and Dr. Hahn had been exposed, although the C.D.C. statement indicated that it was a person “at the White House.” The CNN report confirmed by Dr. Fauci said that his contact of concern was with a White House staff member.
The White House said this week that a military valet to President Trump had also tested positive for the virus.
Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who oversees the Senate’s health committee, said in a statement Saturday that the White House had agreed to give Dr. Hahn and Dr. Redfield a “one-time exception” and allow them to testify by videoconference at a scheduled hearing on Tuesday about how to return safely to work and school.
Tracking the high coronavirus toll in U.S. nursing homes.
At least 25,600 residents and workers have died from the coronavirus at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for older adults in the United States, according to a New York Times database.
While just about 10 percent of the country’s cases have occurred in long-term care facilities, deaths related to Covid-19 in these facilities account for a third of the country’s pandemic fatalities. And in about a dozen states, including Maryland, Oregon and Colorado, such facilities account for an even larger segment — more than half — of deaths.
In the absence of comprehensive data from some states and the federal government, The Times has been assembling its own database of coronavirus cases and deaths at these facilities.
The findings are laid out, and explained, in a series of charts and graphics. The data can also be searched for locations of named facilities with at least 50 recorded cases.
Nursing home populations are at a high risk of being infected by — and dying from — the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is known to be particularly lethal to older adults with underlying health conditions, and can spread more easily through congregate facilities, where many people live in a confined environment and workers move from room to room.
Information from the states themselves about such facilities has been a mix: About a dozen states report very little or nothing at all. Some states, including Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey and South Carolina, regularly release cumulative data on cases and deaths at specific facilities. California, Massachusetts, Michigan and Ohio, among others, provide some details on the number of cases — but not on deaths. Others report aggregate totals for their state but provide no information on where the infections or deaths have occurred.
Trump is losing ground with seniors when it comes to his handling of the virus.
The coronavirus and the Trump administration’s response to it have cost President Trump support from one of his most crucial constituencies: America’s seniors.
For years, Republicans and Mr. Trump have relied on older Americans, the United States’ largest voting bloc, to offset Democrats’ advantage with younger voters. But seniors are also the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, and the Trump campaign’s internal polls show his support among voters over age 65 softening to a concerning degree, people familiar with the numbers said.
A recent Morning Consult poll found that Mr. Trump’s approval rating on the handling of the coronavirus was lower with seniors than with any other group other than young voters. And Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, in recent polls held a 10-point advantage among voters who are 65 and older. A poll commissioned by the campaign showed a similar double-digit gap.
As that has taken shape, the president has all but moved on from a focus on controlling the pandemic and is pushing his agenda to restore the country to a place that will lift his campaign. That has included making clear that despite the pandemic, he wants a traditional political convention in Charlotte, N.C., in late August, with thousands of sign-waving Republican delegates from out of state filling an arena.
But in North Carolina, state officials are not so sure. Even the Republicans.
“I think it’s very clear it may not be possible to host a convention as planned,” said Edmund H. Driggs, a Republican member of the Charlotte City Council.
And the debate is taking place as elements of the pandemic — including its death toll in the United States — have become heated campaign flash points as some voters turn scientific questions into political issues.
“It’s, ‘I don’t like what this implies; therefore I’m going to deny the evidence, and I’m going to question the models, and I’m going to question the motivations of the people who do it,”’ said Naomi Oreskes, a science historian at Harvard.
A virus ‘conspiracy’ video has gone viral.
In a video posted to YouTube on Monday, a woman animatedly described an unsubstantiated secret plot by global elites like Bill Gates and Dr. Anthony Fauci to use the coronavirus pandemic to profit and grab political power.
In the 26-minute video, the woman asserted how Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading voice on the coronavirus, had buried her research about how vaccines can damage people’s immune systems. It is those weakened immune systems, she declared, that have made people susceptible to illnesses like Covid-19.
The video, a scene from a longer dubious documentary called “Plandemic,” was quickly seized upon by anti-vaccinators, the conspiracy group QAnon and activists from the Reopen America movement, generating more than eight million views. And it has turned the woman — Dr. Judy Mikovits, 62, a discredited scientist — into a new star of virus disinformation.
Her ascent was powered not only by the YouTube video but also by a book that she published in April, “Plague of Corruption,” which frames Dr. Mikovits as a truth-teller fighting deception in science. In recent weeks, she has become a darling of far-right publications like The Epoch Times and The Gateway Pundit. Mentions of her on social media and television have spiked to as high as 14,000 a day, according to the media insights company Zignal Labs.
The F.D.A. approves the first antigen test for detecting the virus.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first antigen test that can rapidly detect whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus, a significant advancement that promises to greatly expand the nation’s testing capacity.
The test, by the Quidel Corporation of San Diego, was given emergency use authorization late Friday by the F.D.A., according to a notice on the agency’s website.
Unlike commonly available coronavirus tests that use polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, antigen diagnostics work by quickly detecting fragments of virus in a sample. The newly approved Quidel test will rely on specimens collected from nasal swabs, according to the F.D.A., and they can only be processed by the company’s lab instruments.
“Diagnostic testing is one of the pillars of our nation’s response to Covid-19, and the F.D.A. continues to take actions to help make these critical products available,” the agency said in a statement on Saturday. “One of the main advantages of an antigen test is the speed of the test, which can provide results in minutes.” The F.D.A. said it expected to grant emergency clearance for other antigen tests in the near future.
Experts said the approval of an antigen test for Covid-19 would bolster testing efforts by giving medical workers and health authorities an inexpensive tool for mass rapid testing. Further developed, antigen tests also hold potential for use at home, in the manner of a home pregnancy kit.
“I am very enthusiastic about antigen testing because of its ability to be scaled up to millions of tests a day, and because it has a much more rapid turnaround,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “A lot of us have been looking forward to this moment.”
A California prison has one of the nation’s largest clusters of cases.
At least 850 inmates and 11 staff members at a federal prison in California have tested positive for the coronavirus, the largest outbreak in the federal prison system, according to federal data.
More than 70 percent of the 1,162 inmates at Federal Correctional Institution Lompoc in Santa Barbara County have contracted the virus, according to data from the Bureau of Prisons, underscoring how the pandemic continues to sweep through prisons and jails, where social distancing is nearly impossible and conditions are often unsanitary.
In an effort to control the spread of the virus, F.C.I. Lompoc has suspended all prison visits and has barred inmates from using telephones and email stations until May 18. The restrictions have prompted protests from the families of some inmates.
“People are dying, and we don’t know how our family is in there,” Alexandria Estrada of Tucson, Ariz., whose relative is incarcerated at Lompoc, told The Lompoc Record last month. “They won’t tell us.”
The Bureau of Prisons said that it recently began testing the entire inmate population at F.C.I. Lompoc and had turned the gym, chapel, visiting room and other areas into inmate housing to increase social distancing.
Prison officials said they had also converted a former factory inside the prison into a hospital unit for virus patients, and were encouraging family members to stay in touch with inmates by mail.
“The institution recognizes how important it is to maintain family contact during these uncertain times,” the bureau said in a statement on Saturday.
F.C.I. Lompoc has the ninth-largest known cluster of coronavirus cases in the United States, and the sixth-largest cluster inside a correctional facility, according to a New York Times analysis. State prisons in Ohio, Tennessee and Arkansas have more known cases, as does the county jail in Chicago.
As the U.S. eyes reopening, South Korea provides a cautionary tale.
With more than half of the states moving to ease restrictions that allow people to return to work and some parts of public life, leaders across the United States are cautiously hoping that the pace of the virus’s spread has slowed enough to make a limited reopening manageable.
But a recent cluster of cases in South Korea that led the mayor of Seoul to indefinitely close down bars and nightclubs on Saturday demonstrated how precarious that process can be, even as new infection rates are declining.
South Korea’s early and aggressive response to the arrival of the virus in March helped turn the country’s experience into a success story, significantly flattening the curve of new infections and preventing a full-blown outbreak in one of the world’s more densely populated countries. Experts attributed the success to early widespread testing, contact tracing, isolation measures and public will. The progress was so encouraging that the country moved ahead with reopening businesses and schools and approving sporting events.
Yet even as South Korea has come close to stamping out the virus, bringing infections down to around 10 cases per day in recent weeks, its capital now has at least 27 new cases connected to a single patient who may have spread the virus around several nightclubs.
In the United States, which records nearly 25,000 new cases a day, many experts have warned that reopening while the country is near the peak of the outbreak’s curve could have dire consequences, with new clusters popping up in far-flung and unexpected corners.
Ultimate Fighting becomes the first major U.S. sport to emerge from a shutdown.
On Saturday night, in a nearly empty arena in Jacksonville, Fla., an event by the world’s biggest mixed martial arts organization became the first major North American sport to return from an industrywide shutdown amid the pandemic.
The organization, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, also plans to stage two more cards in Jacksonville next week. And with no competition from Major League Baseball or from hockey and basketball playoffs, U.F.C. is positioned for a big viewership win.
Yet its success will also be measured by whether it proves harmful to public health. On Friday night, U.F.C. officials said that one of their fighters, Ronaldo Souza, a Brazilian middleweight nicknamed Jacare, had been pulled from Saturday’s event because he had tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in the day. The U.F.C. said in a statement that two of Souza’s cornermen had also tested positive for the virus.
States reopen in different stages, in an economic and public health experiment.
States that are taking steps to reopen in the next week will serve as laboratories for the hoped-for economic recovery in the face of a pandemic that has touched nearly every aspect of American life.
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced on Friday that a range of retailers like bookstores and florists could resume selling via curbside pickup. But in an acknowledgment by state officials that the outbreak is unlikely to subside by the fall, the governor ordered mail-in ballots to be sent to the state’s 20.6 million voters for the November election.
Michigan cautiously enacted plans to allow construction and factory workers to return to work sites. Pennsylvania and North Carolina on Friday also allowed some retailers to open, though with certain restrictions like limits on the number of customers allowed inside shops.
Gov. Steve Sisolak of Nevada said that restaurants and personal care businesses could start to reopen on Saturday, but residents were encouraged to stay home, and bars and casinos remained closed. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine’s reopening plan, which he outlined last month, began with certain industries in early May and is set to accelerate with retail stores starting on Tuesday. But Mr. DeWine said other businesses — including restaurants and salons — would have to wait. “We are not quite there yet,” he said.
Job losses have encompassed the entire economy, affecting every major industry. Areas like leisure and hospitality had the biggest losses in April, but even health care shed more than a million jobs. Low-wage workers, including many women and members of racial and ethnic minorities, have been hit especially hard.
“It’s literally off the charts,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. “What would typically take months or quarters to play out in a recession happened in a matter of weeks this time.”
Three children have died of a mysterious syndrome linked to the virus.
Three young children have died in New York of a mysterious toxic-shock inflammation syndrome with links to the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Saturday.
As of Saturday, more than 73 children in New York have been sickened by the rare illness, which has some similarities similar to Kawasaki disease. Mr. Cuomo said many of these children did not show respiratory symptoms commonly associated with the coronavirus when they were brought to area hospitals, but all of them tested positive either for Covid-19 or for its antibodies.
When the coronavirus pandemic began ravaging the New York area two months ago, the state found solace in the initial evidence that children would be largely unaffected, Mr. Cuomo said. That sense of relief was shattered this week when a 5-year-old died in New York City of the newly discovered disease, which doctors described as a “pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.”
Mr. Cuomo did not elaborate on the death of the two additional children, but has asked parents to be vigilant in looking for symptoms such as prolonged fever, severe abdominal pain, change in skin color, racing heart and chest pain.
Before the announcement of the deaths attributed to the new illness, only three children had died of the virus in New York, according to the most recent breakdown from the state.
Mr. Cuomo said the state was working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine whether the confounding illness had been affecting children infected with the virus before this week.
“It is very possible that this has been going on for several weeks and it hasn’t been diagnosed as related to Covid,” Mr. Cuomo said.
Sioux tribal leaders rebuff governor’s request to remove checkpoints.
Sioux tribal leaders have rejected a request from Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota to remove travel checkpoints they established on state and federal highways, saying they were necessary to stop the spread of the virus on tribal land.
In letters on Friday to the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Ms. Noem threatened legal action if they did not remove the checkpoints in 48 hours.
The episode underscores the particular challenges facing hard-hit tribal nations as they seek to respond to the pandemic. Already, tribes across the country struggle with inadequate federal resources and are among the most vulnerable to the virus. Last month, a group of tribes sued the Treasury Department over who was eligible for stimulus relief money, and the agency said this week that it would begin distributing $8 billion in aid to tribal governments.
As the coronavirus took hold in South Dakota, Ms. Noem did not issue a stay-at-home order for the state, and announced guidelines for businesses to reopen if there had been a downward trend in known cases in the surrounding area for 14 days.
In a tweet on Friday, she wrote that the tribes should work with the state in the fight against the virus, “not against their fellow South Dakotans.”
The chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Harold Fraizer, said that while he agreed South Dakotans needed to work together, the governor was interfering “in our efforts to do what science and facts dictate.”
“The virus does not differentiate between members and nonmembers,” he said in a statement. “It obligates us to protect everyone on the reservation regardless of political distinctions.”
Federal officials ship remdesivir to hard-hit states after an outcry from doctors.
The federal government said on Saturday that it was distributing thousands of vials of the antiviral drug remdesivir to state health departments after an outcry from doctors across the country who said they had been denied access to the only approved therapy for hospitalized coronavirus patients.
The announcement was prompted by a backlash from doctors who questioned an opaque distribution system that appeared to favor some hospitals that had few coronavirus patients while skipping over the most besieged. For example, Massachusetts General, a Harvard University teaching hospital, received cases of the drug though officials there said they had not asked for it. Yet other major hospitals were left out, including Boston Medical Center, which has many vulnerable African-American patients.
In response, the Department of Health and Human Services said that it had begun to ship 360 cases of the drug to six states that have been hard hit by the pandemic: Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey. Each case contains 40 vials.
The agency said that Gilead Sciences, the maker of remdesivir, had donated the experimental drug, which earlier this month was given emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients severely ill with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Clinical trials have found that individuals who received remdesivir recovered faster than those who were given a placebo, in 11 days, versus 15 days. But the drug did not significantly reduce fatality rates, the studies found.
“State health departments will distribute the doses to appropriate hospitals in their states because state and local health departments have the greatest insight into community-level needs in the Covid-19 response,” the agency said in a statement.
The drug had previously been dispensed by a wholesale distributor, AmerisourceBergen, according to a list drawn by the federal government.
Friends got back together to buy a tulip farm — but then the virus arrived.
Five friends who had gone to high school in Mount Vernon, Wash., together decades ago thought they had a great plan to get the gang together again.
“We went out to a happy hour and ended up buying a farm,” said Angela Speer, one of the friends who decided to buy Tulip Town, the 30-acre site, last summer.
Their timing was terrible.
The stay-at-home orders in Washington State this spring meant that their expected small window for making profits was slammed shut. The annual tulip festival that draws crowds north of Seattle to Skagit County, where three-quarters of the nation’s commercial tulip crop is grown, was canceled.
The five newcomers on their small farm realized something: Coming in new meant that everything about the way the tulip business was supposed to work was also new, to be tried and tested — and possibly reinvented.
America must decide which spending to emphasize: federal or personal.
As the United States confronts unemployment levels not seen since the Great Depression, Congress and the Trump administration face a pivotal choice: Continue spending trillions trying to shore up businesses and workers, or bet that state reopenings will jump-start the U.S. economy.
At least 20 million people in America are unemployed, and a large share of the nation’s small businesses are shut and facing possible insolvency. Policy misjudgments in the coming weeks could turn the 18 million temporary layoffs recorded in April into permanent job losses that could plunge the United States into a deep and protracted recession unrivaled in recent history.
Yet the federal government is lurching away from the strategy that has thus far helped slow the spread of the coronavirus and sustain people and companies struggling during the economic shutdown.
Over the past two months, as consumers and workers retreated and state officials imposed limits on economic activity, President Trump and bipartisan coalitions in the House and Senate have approved $3 trillion in federal spending to help companies, workers and the unemployed. The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps to keep the financial system functioning, buying up government-backed securities and embarking on plans to purchase corporate and municipal debt to keep credit flowing. Governors have embraced stay-at-home orders in an effort to slow the virus’s spread.
But as the virus threatens to haunt the nation and its economy longer than some officials had anticipated, Mr. Trump and many Republicans in Congress have grown weary of federal spending to support workers and businesses and have begun urging states to get back to what was considered normal.
Economists, including liberals and many conservatives, warn that ending efforts to aid businesses and workers without first enacting a new strategy could force the economy into a summer of partial recoveries, rising infection rates and insufficient support for struggling businesses and those out of work.
The pandemic has widened longstanding educational gaps.
A close look at two very different first-grade classes in two of America’s largest cities, Chicago and Philadelphia, shows how the crisis has laid bare the discrepancies between some private schools, which can provide luxury learning online, and many public schools, which are struggling to adjust.
The pandemic has made it clear that online education requires a mix of elements that not all schools can provide: enthusiastic leadership, teacher expertise and homes equipped with everything children need to learn effectively.
At Chicago Jewish Day School, Rachel Warach helps give her first-grade students four hours and 15 minutes of daily live instruction, including yoga, art and music. Students who need extra help can be assisted remotely with a tutor or a social worker. The school has sent home supplies, and parents have provided internet access, computers and quiet study areas.
At Spruance Elementary in Philadelphia, in one first-grade class, only about 11 of 26 students attend daily.
Dolores Morris, a first-grade teacher there, meets with her students each morning for just an hour. Despite being near retirement, she has thrown herself into learning the technology to teach remotely. Often, she exchanges messages with parents while interacting with her students via Google Classroom.
“I’m thanking God that I can at least see their faces,” she said.
Doctors and patients alike suffer as elective procedures are put on hold.
The shutdown of elective surgeries and other “nonessential” medical care by federal and state officials during the pandemic has left the nation’s 5,200 hospitals, particularly in places where there have been relatively few infections, with idle clinics, vacant operating rooms and a dearth of patients.
“Our hospitals, like every other hospital in the country, are half empty,” said Marvin O’Quinn, the president and chief operating officer for CommonSpirit Health, a Catholic system that operates 137 hospitals across 21 states.
A report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday revealed a huge decline in standard childhood vaccinations during March and April as pediatric offices canceled orders for millions of doses of vaccine for diseases such as measles. Other routine visits for dental checkups and physical therapy have seen similar declines.
More alarmingly, even hospital visits for much more serious conditions like heart attacks and appendicitis appear to be down drastically as patients weigh the risks of entering emergency rooms.
As restrictions ease around the country, some states have begun allowing procedures unrelated to the coronavirus, like knee replacements, colonoscopies and mammogram screenings. But after nearly two months of national action to slow the virus’s spread, the interruption of many medical procedures generally has affected patients with a variety of conditions who suddenly have no choice but to delay nonemergency procedures and preventive care.
Doctors and other medical experts join the front-lines on ballots, too.
In 2018, the United States experienced a “STEM wave” of scientists running for office, and Congress welcomed nine new members with degrees in science, technology, engineering and medicine — two Republicans and seven Democrats. Five were women.
Some candidates said they had decided to enter a new arena because they viewed the Trump administration as hostile to their old one: scientific expertise. A president who said there are “scientists on both sides of the issue” on climate change was cause for alarm.
For some, that alarm has grown in light of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. The coronavirus has given front-line physicians a clear view of the life-or-death stakes of government decision making, whether on social distancing or contact tracing.
And as the pandemic turns a spotlight on health care workers, many doctors-turned-candidates say it’s time to try to convert those cheers into votes.
“Part of what people are looking for is not the status quo,” said Shaughnessy Naughton, a chemist who is president of 314 Action, a political action committee that aims to see more scientists in politics. “Women and physicians represent change.”

Full text: Jared Kushner tried to address a looming supply shortage with volunteers from the private sector. More than 1,000 people have died each day for over a month. Meat is growing scarcer.
This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic .
The White House will wind down the coronavirus task force in coming weeks.
Despite growing evidence that the pandemic is still raging, President Trump and other administration officials said on Tuesday that they had made so much progress in bringing it under control that they planned to wind down the coronavirus task force in the coming weeks and focus the White House on restarting the economy.
Mr. Trump said the task force would be shut down and replaced with an unspecified new advisory body as the country moved into what he called Phase 2 of a response to a pandemic that has killed more than 71,000 Americans.
“We will have something in a different form,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he toured a Honeywell mask manufacturing plant in Arizona, where he wore safety goggles but no mask. The president praised the work of the task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, but said it was time to focus on safety and reopening the country.
Mr. Pence said the group would probably wrap up its work around the end of the May, and shift management of the public health response back to the federal agencies whose work it was created to coordinate.
The news of the winding down of the task force came as the rate of new infections and deaths was falling in New York but was continuing to rise in much of the rest of the country. A number of projections suggest that deaths will remain at elevated levels for months and are likely to increase as states ease their stay-at-home orders.
Still, Mr. Trump seemed eager to move past the pandemic on Tuesday. Venturing beyond the Mid-Atlantic for the first time in more than two months, he used an official appearance at the Arizona factory as his latest show of support for returning to normal life.
In heavily political remarks after a tour of the facility, the president said “that our country is now in the next stage of the battle” against the virus and “now we are reopening our country.” Mr. Trump also boasted of his 2016 electoral victory in the state, called for “the full truth about the China situation” and gave the microphone to two local campaign supporters.
Kushner’s volunteer force prioritized medical supplies from Trump’s allies.
As the federal government’s warehouses were running bare and medical workers were improvising their own safety gear, the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, placed a team of young volunteers with no procurement experience on the front line of the administration’s supply-chain task force. The volunteers were told to prioritize tips from political allies and associates of President Trump, tracked on a spreadsheet called “V.I.P. Update,” according to documents and emails obtained by The New York Times.
Among them were leads from Republican members of Congress, the Trump youth activist Charlie Kirk and a former “Apprentice” contestant who serves as the campaign chair of Women for Trump. Few of the leads, V.I.P. or otherwise, panned out, according to a whistle-blower memo written by one volunteer and sent to the House Oversight Committee.
Federal officials who had spent years devising emergency plans were layered over by Kushner allies, who believed their private-sector experience could solve the country’s looming supply shortage. The young volunteers — who came from venture capital and private equity firms — had the know-how to quickly weed out good leads from the mountain of bad ones, administration officials said in an interview. FEMA and other agencies, they said, were not equipped for the unprecedented task.
But at least one tip the volunteers forwarded turned into an expensive debacle. In late March, according to emails obtained by The Times, two of the volunteers passed along procurement forms submitted by Yaron Oren-Pines, a Silicon Valley engineer who said he could provide more than 1,000 ventilators. Federal officials then sent the tip to senior officials in New York, who assumed Mr. Oren-Pines had been vetted and awarded him an eye-popping $69 million contract. Not a single ventilator was delivered.
“The nature and scale of the response seemed grossly inadequate,” said a volunteer, who like the others signed a nondisclosure agreement and spoke only on the condition of anonymity. “It was bureaucratic cycles of chaos.”
Comparing recent deaths to historical figures hints at real toll in each state.
As the coronavirus pandemic cuts through the country, it is leaving behind large numbers of deaths that surpasses those of recent history. A New York Times analysis of state data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention begins to offer a picture of just how many lives have been lost, both as a result of the coronavirus and fears about using an overwhelmed health care system.
A handful of states account for the bulk of the death surge across the United States, the analysis found. In New York City, for example, since mid-March there have been 23,000 more deaths than normal. Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey have also seen more than 1,000 deaths more than the usual figure between March 15 and April 11.
In a larger group of states, including California, Florida and Texas, the increases in deaths were more modest during the early phase of the pandemic, but death rates are still higher than normal.
In other states, including Iowa, Kentucky and Missouri, deaths are actually below the expected trend. That may be because of lags in data reporting. But it could also be that stay-at-home orders have lowered death rates from those caused by car crashes or the flu.
A federal scientist said he was pressured to steer contracts to certain clients.
A federal scientist who says he was ousted from his job amid a dispute over an unproven coronavirus treatment pushed by President Trump said on Tuesday that top administration officials repeatedly pressured him to steer millions of dollars in contracts to the clients of a well-connected consultant.
The scientist, Rick Bright, was director of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority until his removal in April. He said in a formal whistle-blower complaint that he had been protesting “cronyism” and contract abuse since 2017.
Questionable contracts have gone to “companies with political connections to the administration,” the complaint said, including a drug company tied to a friend of Jared Kushner’s, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser. It said Dr. Bright was retaliated against by his superiors.
The 89-page complaint, filed with the Office of Special Counsel, which protects federal whistle-blowers, also said Dr. Bright “encountered opposition” from department superiors — including Alex M. Azar II, the Health and Human Services secretary — when he pushed as early as January for the necessary resources to develop drugs and vaccines to counter the emerging pandemic.
The report provides a window into the inner workings of BARDA, a tiny agency created in 2006 as a response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It partners with industry in developing “medical countermeasures” that can be stockpiled by the federal government to combat biological or chemical attacks and pandemic threats.
BARDA has spent billions of dollars on contracts with dozens of different suppliers, including major pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology firms.
An Amazon worker on Staten Island dies of virus complications.
An employee at an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island died after contracting the virus, the company said on Tuesday, weeks after the building was the scene of a protest over what workers said were inadequate safety precautions.
The unidentified employee, who was in his late 60s, was last at work at the warehouse on April 5, the company said. He was confirmed to have the virus six days later and had been in quarantine since then.
“We are deeply saddened by the loss of an associate at our site in Staten Island, N.Y.,” Kristen Kish, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in a statement. “His family and loved ones are in our thoughts, and we are supporting his fellow colleagues.”
The Staten Island worker is at least the third Amazon employee who the company has confirmed died of complications of the virus. The others worked in Hawthorne, Calif., and Tracy, Calif. Amazon said that an unspecified number of other workers at the Staten Island warehouse had tested positive for the virus.
The Verge, which earlier reported the death of the Staten Island employee, said that at least 29 workers at the warehouse had become sick.
Amazon has faced pressure over whether it has done enough to protect its hundreds of thousands of workers from being exposed to the virus as they continue to pack and ship products to millions of Americans during the pandemic.
New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, informed Amazon last month that her office was investigating whether the company had violated federal worker-safety laws and New York’s whistle-blower protections by firing an employee at the Staten Island warehouse who challenged the company over its response to the outbreak.
As outbreaks shutter plants, meat is scarcer in groceries and drive-throughs.
Hundreds of Wendy’s restaurants have run out of hamburgers. Kroger, the largest supermarket chain in the United States, is limiting the amount of ground beef and pork that customers can buy at some stores. And Costco, where shoppers typically buy in bulk, has placed a three-product cap on purchases of fresh beef, poultry and pork.
Over the past month, dozens of meatpacking plants across the country have shut down because of outbreaks, raising concerns about the U.S. meat supply. Now, the effects of those disruptions are reaching customers at grocery stores and fast-food drive-throughs, where certain types of meat are becoming harder to find.
On Monday, nearly one in five Wendy’s restaurants — a total of 1,043 locations — were completely sold out of beef products, including burgers, according to an analysis by the financial firm Stephens, which examined every Wendy’s online menu in the United States.
“Some of our menu items may be temporarily limited at some restaurants in this current environment,” a Wendy’s spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday. “It is widely known that beef suppliers across North America are currently facing production challenges.”
At the same time, some grocery stores have announced limits on meat purchases. In addition to Costco and Kroger, Hy-Vee said on Tuesday that it would restrict customers to four packages of fresh beef, ground beef, pork and chicken.
Still waiting on your stimulus payment? Here’s what to do.
It’s been weeks since people started receiving coronavirus relief payments. You’ve checked and rechecked your eligibility, just to be sure. But still, no $1,200 stimulus payment — or anything else — has arrived in your bank account or your mailbox.
Tens of millions of people have already received their payments, but many other Americans are still waiting or wondering where their checks are. There are a lot of reasons you could be among those still waiting, even if the government has removed some of the hurdles it initially set up.
So what do you do if your money hasn’t arrived? Ron Lieber of The Times has some tips, from updating your banking information to searching in old accounts to, yes, concerns about fraud. You can run through his checklist here.
Wisconsin’s top court sounds skeptical of the state’s stay-at-home order.
Members of Wisconsin’s top court on Tuesday sounded skeptical of the state health secretary’s authority to issue a stay-at-home order, a possible sign that the court may strike down sweeping restrictions at the request of the Republican-controlled Legislature.
At a 90-minute hearing conducted over video chat, members of the seven-person court’s conservative majority asked tough questions of the lawyer defending Andrea Palm, the state’s top health official. She had issued the order last month that forbade most travel, closed schools and ordered Wisconsin residents to largely stay in their homes.
Colin Roth, an assistant attorney general, finished just one sentence in defense of the order before a justice stepped in.
“Isn’t it the very definition of tyranny for one person to order people to be imprisoned for going to work, among other ordinarily lawful activities?” asked Justice Rebecca Bradley, who was appointed by Scott Walker, the Republican former governor, before she was elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Later, Justice Daniel Kelly, who is serving out the end of his term after losing an election to a liberal challenger last month, got Mr. Roth to concede that he was arguing for Ms. Palm, the state’s acting health secretary, to have broad authority.
“Your position is: The secretary can identify behavior that is not otherwise criminal, and she can — all by herself — sit down at her computer keyboard, write up a description of behavior, and make it criminal, correct?” Mr. Kelly asked. Mr. Roth said this was indeed true, though he argued that the Legislature had given her that power.
Mr. Roth also argued that “people will die” if the justices strike down the order and nothing replaces it. The case is being closely watched, as it could be the first statewide stay-at-home order to be struck down by a court.
The governor of Texas told lawmakers he expected the virus to spread as businesses reopened.
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas told lawmakers in a phone call last week that he expected the virus to continue spreading after the state reopened, and that the goal had never been to get infections down to zero, according to a recording of the call released by progressive activists on Tuesday. The remarks outraged Democrats, who said the comments were a sign that the governor knew he was putting Texans at risk as he pushed to reopen.
Mr. Abbott, a Republican, had the call with state legislators and members of Congress on Friday, the same day he ended the state’s stay-at-home order and allowed shopping malls, restaurants and other businesses to reopen at a limited capacity.
In a portion of the leaked audio, Mr. Abbott says, “How do we know reopening businesses won’t result in faster spread or more cases of Covid-19?”
He continues: “Listen, the fact of the matter is, pretty much every scientific and medical report shows that whenever you have a reopening, whether you want to call it a reopening of business or just a reopening of society in the aftermath of something like this, it actually will lead to an increase in spread. It’s almost ipso facto. The more that you have people out there, the greater the possibility there is for transmission. And so the goal never has been to get transmission of Covid-19 down to zero.”
The governor’s remarks echo statements he has made about containing the virus. They are also in line with comments from public health experts, who have repeatedly said that as the state reopens and as social distancing eases, the number of cases will go up. Some experts say that can be managed through testing and case monitoring; others say Texas is reopening too soon.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Abbott defended his approach.
“I think everybody recognizes — it’s been said frequently — that as a society does begin to open up again, it could lead to increased infections,” the governor said. “And that’s exactly why we have this surge team in place.”
The governor on Tuesday expanded the list of businesses allowed to reopen, saying that hair and nail salons, barbershops and tanning salons could resume operations with restrictions on Friday, and gyms on May 18.
The expansion represented a shift by the governor, who had previously said he wanted to see two weeks of data to ensure there were no flare-ups before reopening any of those businesses.
As social restrictions begin to ease, hear from the health care workers who are still on the front lines.
Health care workers continue to risk their lives to care for virus patients. The Times has collected stories from nurses, doctors and E.M.T.s from around the world about what keeps them up at night and what inspires them to keep fighting.
More than 1,600 previously undisclosed deaths were reported at nursing homes in New York.
New York State’s Health Department statistics released on Monday included the previously undisclosed deaths of more than 1,600 people who were presumed to have died of the virus at nursing homes but who had not received a confirmed diagnosis.
By May 3, according to the new data, 4,813 people had died of the virus at nursing homes. The data did not include nursing home residents who died in hospitals.
The number of deaths of nursing home residents, either at homes or in hospitals, was 3,025 on April 28, and approximately 100 more people died at nursing homes from April 29 to May 2, according to state figures.
A spokesman for the department said officials had revised the state’s system for gathering and evaluating data from homes, and figures would probably continue to be revised.
David C. Grabowski, a Harvard University researcher who studies nursing homes, said that when the final data was in, nursing homes would probably account for about half of the Covid-19 deaths in every state, as they already do in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, among others.
Nursing homes long fought against the release of death counts for individual facilities, arguing that a high death count might not indicate poor infection control and might scare families unnecessarily.
As schools weigh reopening, new research suggests children can transmit the virus to adults.
Fewer children get infected than adults, and most of those who do have mild symptoms, if any. But answering the question of whether they transmit the virus to adults is key to deciding whether and when to reopen schools, a step that President Trump has urged states to consider before the summer.
Two new studies offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. Neither proved it, but the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said.
Reopening schools may nudge the epidemic’s reproduction number — the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case — to dangerous levels in many U.S. communities, epidemiologists warned after reviewing the results from the new studies.
In one study, published in the journal Science, a team analyzed data from two cities in China — Wuhan and Shanghai — and found that children were about a third as susceptible to infection as adults were. But when schools were open, they found, children had about three times as many contacts as adults, and three times as many opportunities to become infected, essentially evening out their risk.
Based on their data, the researchers estimated that closing schools is not enough on its own to stop an outbreak, but it can reduce the surge by about 40 to 60 percent and slow the epidemic’s course.
The second study, by a group of German researchers, was more straightforward. The team tested children and adults and found that children who test positive harbor just as much virus as adults do — sometimes more — and so, presumably, are just as infectious.
In New York City, 15 children, many of whom had fallen ill with the virus, have recently been hospitalized with a mysterious syndrome that doctors do not yet fully understand but that has also been reported in several European countries, health officials announced on Monday. Many of the children, ages 2 to 15, have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease, a rare illness in children that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries, the city’s health department said.
Pfizer and BioNTech said their experimental vaccine began human trials on Monday.
Two of the many projects underway to develop a vaccine announced that they had taken significant steps forward, with both using a nontraditional approach based on genetic technology. They aim to use the patient’s own cells as factories to churn out a protein that will stimulate the immune system.
Pfizer and the German pharmaceutical company BioNTech said their experimental vaccine began human trials in the United States on Monday. If the tests succeed, the vaccine could be ready for emergency use as early as September.
Researchers at two Harvard-affiliated hospitals reported that, based on promising results in mice, they have two vaccine candidates being manufactured for use in human trials that may begin later this year.
Unlike traditional vaccines that use killed or weakened viruses to provoke an immune response, these methods use genetic material that directs the patient’s cells to make a protein found on the virus. That protein should set off alarms in the immune system and train it to fight.

A virus protest at Michigan’s Capitol prompted an effort to ban guns.
The Michigan State Capitol Commission searched for a way to ban guns from the statehouse after armed protesters gathered inside last week to protest the governor’s stay-at-home order, but the commission determined on Tuesday that it could not supersede state law.
“We do not like seeing guns brought into the building — loaded guns — and I’m a Second Amendment advocate,” John Truscott, a Republican and the vice chairman of the commission, said in a radio interview.
Mr. Truscott told WWJ NewsRadio that a decision to ban guns would have to come from the Legislature or by voter initiative. It is legal to openly carry a firearm in public in Michigan. The six-member commission believes that a 1931 state law allows people to carry concealed weapons inside the building with a license, Mr. Truscott told The Detroit News.
The debate comes after hundreds of people gathered outside the Capitol on Thursday, demanding an end to Michigan’s state of emergency and stay-at-home order. A state senator shared a photo of protesters carrying guns in the Senate public gallery.
“Directly above me, men with rifles yelling at us,” State Senator Dayna Polehanki wrote on Twitter. “Some of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them.”
The Trump administration is considering tax-cut proposals for the next response bill.
The Trump administration is considering a wide range of tax-cut proposals for businesses and investors in the next response bill as it tries to shift from government spending programs to support the economy toward measures that aim to reinvigorate growth.
The list of ideas under discussion includes a reduction in the capital gains tax rate and measures that would allow companies to deduct the full costs of any investments they make now or in the future, according to administration officials and several outside experts who have discussed plans with the White House.
Those proposals, which are still being debated and are not final, could accompany Mr. Trump’s top two priorities for the next package: the suspension of payroll taxes for workers and an expanded deduction for corporate spending on meals and entertainment.
The nominee for a watchdog position vowed to quit, or be fired, rather than bow to political pressure.
Brian D. Miller, Mr. Trump’s nominee for the role of a special inspector general, told lawmakers that he would remain independent and vowed to resign or be fired if he faced political pressure from the president.
Mr. Miller, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, tried to defuse fears that he was not independent enough for the prominent watchdog role amid concerns that his current position as a White House lawyer meant he would be putting Mr. Trump’s interests before those of American taxpayers.
Lawmakers created the inspector general role to oversee funds that are part of the $2 trillion economic relief package that Congress passed in March, including money that is being used to support the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending facilities, along with money for loans and grants to airlines and other companies that are deemed critical for national security.
The nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, has not been received well by Democrats, who insisted on strict oversight as a condition of passage.
In an unusual signing statement, Mr. Trump suggested he had the power to decide what information a newly created inspector general intended to monitor the fund could share with Congress. That prompted concern among lawmakers and watchdog groups, which said Mr. Trump’s statement went further than previous presidents in limiting the inspector general’s authority.
For more than two hours, Mr. Miller was grilled by senators about the president’s statement and his willingness to defy the White House if necessary. He said that the law governing inspectors general would require him to report wrongdoing to Congress, suggesting that he would not comply with that statement, and he insisted that he would resign or accept being fired if he faced political pressure from Mr. Trump.
“I will be independent,” Mr. Miller said. “If the president removes me, he removes me. If I am unable to do my job, I will resign.”
Mr. Trump has not been shy about his resistance to independent oversight and has removed several inspectors general in recent weeks, including a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services who angered him with a report last month highlighting supply shortages and testing delays at hospitals during the pandemic.
Mr. Miller, a former federal prosecutor, also served as the inspector general of the General Services Administration from 2005 to 2014, overseeing a sprawling agency in charge of the federal government’s real estate.
In 2018, Mr. Miller joined the White House Counsel’s Office and worked on the team defending Mr. Trump during his impeachment proceedings.
Two New England men face the first federal fraud charges related to small business loan program.
Two businessmen were arrested Tuesday on charges of trying to defraud the government’s small business lending program. They were the first federal fraud charges related to the $660 billion program that was aimed at helping businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic but has been riddled with problems.
The men, David Staveley of Andover, Mass., and David Butziger of Warwick, R.I., were accused of conspiring to file false bank loan applications falsely claiming that Mr. Staveley needed government assistance for three struggling restaurants that employed dozens of people, the U.S. attorney’s office in Rhode Island said.
The men sought about half-million dollars in loans through the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program, which is intended to help businesses pay employees; the loans would be forgiven if Mr. Staveley met certain requirements.
But the employees did not exist, two of the three restaurants had closed weeks before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered restaurants nationwide and Mr. Staveley had no relationship with the third restaurant on the application, prosecutors said. Lawyers for the men could not be immediately found.
A lawsuit filed by immigration rights activists challenges a relief act.
Immigration rights activists on Tuesday filed a federal lawsuit challenging a provision in the $2 trillion relief act that denies $500 payments to United States citizen children if one or both of their parents are undocumented immigrants, Michael D. Shear reports.
In addition to relief payments for adults, the act sends payments of $500 per child under 17 to the parents of families making $150,000 or less. But the adults are required to have social security numbers. Many undocumented immigrants, who are unable to get a social security number, file tax returns using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number instead. Those families are unable to receive the relief payments.
The lawsuit, filed by CASA, an immigrant rights group, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University, says the provision amounts to unconstitutional discrimination against the children, who are American citizens.
“The refusal to distribute this benefit to U.S. citizen children undermines the CARES Act’s goals of providing assistance to Americans in need, frustrates the Act’s efforts to jump-start the economy, and punishes citizen children for their parents’ status,” the groups argue in the lawsuit, which was filed in United States District Court in Maryland.
The suit, which claims discrimination on behalf of several children, adds that the provision amounts to “punishment that is particularly nonsensical given that undocumented immigrants, collectively, pay billions of dollars each year in taxes. More fundamentally, this discrimination violates the equal protection principles embodied in the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.”
Lawsuits have already been filed on behalf of American citizens who are married to undocumented adults and file their taxes jointly are also unable to apply for their $1,200 relief payments. Tuesday’s suit focuses on the payments intended to benefit children who are American citizens.
The lawsuit notes that other means-tested federal benefits programs — like food stamps, child tax credits, and child nutrition programs — are not restricted in the same way.
Defenders of the provision note that children with so-called “mixed-status” parent — an undocumented parent married to a United States citizen — can receive the payments if their parents file their taxes separately rather than jointly. But the lawsuit points out that doing so often increases other tax obligations, effectively wiping out the relief payments.
“Thus, U.S. citizen children who have mixed-status parents are denied benefits equal to those available to similarly situated U.S. citizen children who have no undocumented parents,” the groups say in the lawsuit.
Trump arrives in Arizona on his first cross-country trip since the virus restrictions.
Mr. Trump traveled to Phoenix on Tuesday, where he toured a Honeywell International Inc. plant that is manufacturing medical masks and held a round table on Native American issues.
The trip was an opportunity for the president, who has been criticized for not doing more to prepare for the virus, to demonstrate that vital supplies were being manufactured on a mass scale. It also brougt him to a potential battleground state for his re-election campaign. Mr. Trump held one of his last campaign rallies in Phoenix on Feb. 19, before social distancing practices were put into effect. His last rally was in Charlotte, N.C., on March 2.
Mr. Trump briefly spoke with reporters before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn, responding to questions about an internal federal report that projected a steep rise in cases over the next month even as states began reopening.
Mr. Trump downplayed the document, first reported by The Times, saying: “That’s a report with no mitigation. We’re doing a lot of mitigation.”
While travel could put Mr. Trump and his staff at greater risk of exposure to the virus, he insisted that his trip would be safe. “Everybody traveling has been tested. Literally, they have been tested in the last hour,” he said, adding that White House test kits return results within five minutes.
Mr. Trump said that he would don a mask for his visit to the Honeywell plant “if it’s a mask facility.” It was unclear whether he meant the plant’s guidelines for mask usage or the nature of its production; Honeywell manufactures medical masks.
As Mr. Trump prepared to leave for Arizona, the Treasury Department announced Tuesday that it would begin distributing $4.8 billion in aid allocated for Native American tribes in the stimulus package, releasing a stalled tranche of funds that the tribes had sued to obtain.
A group of tribes had sued Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and the department after the administration failed to provide any of the $8 billion set aside for tribal governments, or to announce its criteria for disbursing it, before a statutory deadline in late April. The delay dealt another blow to some of the most vulnerable and hardest-hit communities in the country.
Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, has been relatively cautious about reopening the state’s economy compared with other Republican governors. Official figures show that the state has had 8,919 cases and 362 deaths, though infectious disease specialists say Arizona is probably undercounting deaths.
N.Y. doctors warn about a mysterious illness affecting children that might be related.
Fifteen children, many of whom had fallen ill the virus, have recently been hospitalized in New York City with a mysterious syndrome that doctors do not yet fully understand but that has also been reported in several European countries, health officials announced on Monday night.
Many of the children, ages 2 to 15, have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease, a rare illness in children that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries, the city’s health department said.
According to a bulletin from the city’s Health Department, none of the patients have died, describing the illness as a “multisystem inflammatory syndrome potentially associated with Covid-19,” the disease caused by the virus. The state health commissioner said late Monday night that state officials were also investigating.
“The clinical nature of this virus is such that we are asking all providers to contact us immediately if they see patients who meet the criteria we’ve outlined,” the New York City health commissioner said in a statement.
“And to parents,” the commissioner added, “if your child has symptoms like fever, rash, abdominal pain or vomiting, call your doctor right away.”
The syndrome has received growing attention in recent weeks as cases have begun appearing in European countries hit hard by the virus. Last week, an alert was sent to general practitioners in London warning that “there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multisystem inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the U.K.” The chief medical officer for England told reporters that a link with the virus was “certainly plausible.”
Asked about the British reports, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, a World Health Organization scientist, told reporters last week that the inflammatory syndrome “seems to be rare.”
Pediatricians in France, Italy and Spain have also reported dozens of cases of children presenting symptoms of the syndrome, but doctors have said that it is too early to link them.
A study by the Fed suggests that sickness helped drive extremism in the 20th century.
A jump in flu deaths early in the 20th century may have helped to drive the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany, Federal Reserve Bank of New York research showed, in a stark warning that pandemics can drive societal change.
“Influenza deaths of 1918 are correlated with an increase in the share of votes won by right-wing extremists,” the Fed economist Kristian Blickle wrote. The finding holds even counting for a city’s ethnic and religious makeup, regional unemployment, past right-wing voting, and other local characteristics.
He points out that local public spending dropped in the wake of the deadly flu, especially on services that benefited young people, like school. That spending decline itself does not seem to drive the right-wing political extremism that followed, the paper found.
On the other hand, “the correlation between influenza mortality and the vote share won by right-wing extremists is stronger in regions that had historically blamed minorities, particularly Jews, for medieval plagues,” Mr. Blickle wrote. He adds that “the disease may have fostered a hatred of ‘others’, as it was perceived to come from abroad.”
Mr. Blickle notes that the study has limitations. Data on the period is somewhat sporadic, so the conclusions are based on a small sample. Disentangling disease repercussions and the after-effects of World War I are difficult.
Still, the “results are striking in part because they are robust to a large battery of alternate specifications despite being based on a relatively small sample,” he writes, and they suggest that influenza mortality “profoundly shaped German society going forward.”
In the months since the virus spread around the world, The Times’s Neil MacFarquhar reported, America’s extremists have attempted to turn the coronavirus pandemic into a potent recruiting tool in the deep corners of the internet and on the streets of state capitals by twisting the public health crisis to bolster their white supremacist, anti-government agenda.
Embellishing developments to fit their usual agenda, extremists have spread disinformation on the transmission of the virus and disparaged stay-at-home orders as “medical martial law” — the long-anticipated advent of a totalitarian state.
An internal Trump administration report expects about 200,000 daily cases by June.
Even as New York reported on Tuesday a daily death toll of 230, among the lowest in weeks, and as Gov. Andrew Cuomo outlined on Monday a soft blueprint for how New York State’s economy might begin to restart, there was growing concern that the scattered and often chaotic approach to mitigating the spread of the virus on a national level was failing.
While Mr. Trump pressed states to reopen their economies, his administration was privately projecting a steady rise in infections and deaths over the next several weeks, reaching about 3,000 daily deaths on June 1 — nearly double the current level.
The more dire assessments reflect the decisions of governors across the country to ease social-distancing measures even as the number of new cases holds steady and, in some cases, is even rising.
The projections, based on data collected by various agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and laid out in an internal document obtained Monday by The New York Times, forecast about 200,000 new cases each day by the end of May, up from about 30,000 cases now. There are currently about 1,750 deaths per day, the data show.
That was not the only forecast of more carnage. Another model, closely watched by White House officials, raised its fatality projections on Monday to more than 134,000 American deaths by early August. The model, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, more than doubled its previous projection of about 60,000 total deaths, an increase that it said partly reflects “changes in mobility and social-distancing policies.”
This morgue worker is placing flowers on every new body bag.
A few days a week, a woman arrives at the Metropolitan Plant and Flower Exchange — a bunker along Route 17 North in Paramus, N.J. They know her by her hospital scrubs.
She picks up her standing order — yellow daffodils — and brings them with her to work at Hackensack University Medical Center.
They are not for her office or for co-workers. She carries them out back and walks into a parking garage. There are now three long trailers there, with loud motors powering their refrigerators. Inside each trailer are bodies in bags, stacked on shelves three high — coronavirus victims awaiting pickup.
The woman’s name is Tanisha Brunson-Malone, and she is a forensic technician at the hospital’s morgue who performs autopsies and oversees funeral home pickups of patients who have died. And she has been entering each trailer, walking the aisles between rows and placing a flower on each new body bag.
Ms. Brunson-Malone’s gesture is all but invisible, seen by only some colleagues and the funeral home workers who arrive to claim bodies. Her flowers are for the dead alone, a fleeting brush with dignity and decorum on the way from one sad place to another.
Before, she would open up the trailers each day and see how many people were dying alone. So she decided to give them a more dignified send-off. She said she spends $100 a week on flowers.
“I was kind of like their voice,” she said, “because they were voiceless.”
Are there more symptoms to be aware of?
Dermatologists say that painful red or purple lesions on your toes should prompt testing for the virus, even though many patients have no other symptoms. Here’s what you need to know about chilblains and other symptoms.
The virus reached France in December, doctors say, rewriting the epidemic’s timeline. Read more from our global team.

Full text: European plans for reopening have prompted protests and sown confusion, and the band U2 has helped get protective gear to Ireland.
This briefing has ended. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic here.
Nations confront the possibility that reopening may be harder than locking down.
Experts across Europe had warned that closing down countries to contain the coronavirus pandemic would be far easier than opening them up again. More and more, that is looking to be true.
In countries hit hardest by the virus, protests have broken out and frustration has mounted over the way governments have handled, or mishandled, the easing of lockdowns.
In Italy, which has had the deadliest outbreak in Europe, vibrant and vocal protests from politicians, business leaders, mayors and others confused about the government’s plans have created a sense of impending chaos as the country prepares to enter a reopening phase on Monday.
Italy will allow restaurants to provide takeout service starting Monday, but trattorias, bars and coffee shops will not be allowed to seat customers for some weeks. Many entrepreneurs complain that they are going broke and that the state requirements will essentially make business impossible.
To draw attention to their plight, thousands of small-business owners have given their mayors the keys to their restaurants and cafes.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has defended the plan and the government’s performance. “We did a well-articulated and well-structured plan,” he said last week.
In France, teachers say plans to gradually reopen schools starting May 11 have created a climate of confusion. They were not sure which classes would open, how many students would be allowed in and whether any measures would ensure their safety. As of Sunday, France has registered 131,287 cases and 24,895 deaths, and the numbers appeared to be stabilizing at a high plateau.
And as Spain prepares to relax some lockdown rules this month, public pressure has forced the government to retreat on key steps. The government initially barred children from going outside, then allowed them to accompany their parents to go on errands. When the political opposition and parent groups protested, it allowed them to go for walks, too. On Saturday, adults and teenagers were allowed outside for exercise for the first time in seven weeks.
On Sunday, Spain reported 164 deaths and 838 confirmed infections overnight, its lowest daily numbers since the week in mid-March when the nation went into lockdown.
Even as Spain’s numbers continue to improve, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is hoping Parliament will extend the state of emergency beyond May 10, but he leads a minority government and the main opposition Popular Party has been increasingly critical of the government’s handling of the crisis.
Teodoro García Egea, the Popular Party secretary general, said on Sunday that the party was not committed to supporting a longer state of emergency.
Doctors at the heart of the outbreak in Italy warn that antibody testing is not a panacea.
Many people around the world have seized on antibodies and their promise of potential immunity to the coronavirus as the golden ticket to reopen societies and economies.
Politicians in Italy, the epicenter of Europe’s contagion, have even proposed issuing licenses to those who had beaten the virus and developed the right antibodies to get back to work.
But that talk, always ahead of the science, has grown more muted in recent weeks. With the research refusing to cooperate, experts in Italy say the promise of antibodies may not be what people have imagined. At least for now.
“We don’t know if everyone who has had the disease has developed an acceptable protective immunity,” said Dr. Alessandro Venturi, the president of the San Matteo hospital in the Lombardy town of Pavia. The hospital validated the antibody screening test used for mapping the virus in Lombardy, Italy’s hardest hit region.
Infected people develop different quantities of antibodies, and researchers are still studying the level that offers protection, and for how long.
“We don’t know how long they last,” Dr. Venturi said. ‘‘This is the central point.”
Many regions, including Lombardy and Veneto, are still doing such screenings. But whereas last month the presidents of those regions promoted the idea of issuing licenses to members of an immune work force, now they have downgraded the tests from panacea to a research tool.
“Immunity licenses are just rubbish,” said Mario Plebani, the coordinator of the antibody tests for the Veneto region.
U.S. roundup: Pompeo asserts ‘enormous evidence’ ties the virus to a Wuhan lab, a claim not backed yet by U.S. intelligence.
The U.S. secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, doubled down on President Trump’s assertions about the origins of the virus, saying on Sunday that “there’s enormous evidence” the coronavirus originated in a research laboratory in Wuhan, China, even while American intelligence agencies say they have reached no conclusion on the issue.
Mr. Pompeo was one of a number of administration officials and other public figures who appeared on Sunday morning news shows to discuss the coronavirus. A former C.I.A. chief and one of the administration’s most hawkish officials on China, he has repeatedly blamed China’s Communist Party for covering up evidence and denying American experts access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
The Chinese government has vigorously denied that the virus leaked from the laboratory, and at one point suggested the American military created it.
The Times reported on Thursday that senior Trump administration officials were pushing spy agencies to hunt for evidence to support the theory that the outbreak emerged from a Wuhan lab, and that some intelligence analysts feared the pressure would distort assessments, and that they could be used as a political weapon in an intensifying battle with China.
The same day, President Trump said he had a high degree of confidence that the laboratory was the source of the outbreak but when pressed for evidence said, “I’m not allowed to tell you that.”
.
Speaking during a virtual town hall meeting Sunday on Fox News, the president elaborated.
“Personally I think they made a horrible mistake,” he said. “They didn’t want to admit it. We wanted to go in but they didn’t want us there. World Health wanted to go in. They tried to cover it, they tried to put it out. It’s like trying to put out a fire.”
Mr. Trump also confirmed reports that his intelligence briefings cited the virus even as he argued that it had not been presented in an alarming way that demanded immediate action.
“On Jan. 23 I was told that there could be a virus coming in but it was of no real import,” Mr. Trump said. “In other words, it wasn’t, ‘Oh, we’ve got to do something, we’ve got to do something.’ It was a brief conversation and it was only on Jan. 23. Shortly thereafter, I closed the country to China. We had 23 people in the room and I was the only one in the room who wanted to close it down.”
Mr. Trump was referring to his decision on Jan. 30 to limit travel from China, where the outbreak had started, a move that in fact was recommended by some of his advisers and came only after major U.S. airlines had already canceled flights. Some public health advisers have said the travel limits helped slow the spread to the United States but complained that the Trump administration did not use the extra time to adequately prepare by ramping up testing and medical equipment.
The president predicted on Sunday night that the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the country may reach as high as 100,000 in the United States, far higher than he had forecast just weeks ago, even as he pressed states to begin reopening the shuttered economy.
Mr. Trump also said during the town hall that a vaccine for Covid-19 would be available by the end of this year, but experts have said that it would take a year to 18 months.
The virus is still spreading in the United States, because efforts to contain it have been incomplete at best, public health experts warned on Sunday, saying that there were signs that the country may face a steady flow of new cases and deaths for many months to come.
Coronavirus case counts continue to rise in 20 states, including Illinois, Texas and Maryland, even as some states are beginning to relax restrictions, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said on the CBS program “Face the Nation.”
A global blowback builds against China over the coronavirus outbreak.
Australia has called for an inquiry into the origin of the virus. Britain and Germany are hesitating anew about inviting in the Chinese tech giant Huawei. President Trump has blamed China for the contagion and is seeking to punish it. Some governments want to sue Beijing for damages and reparations.
Across the globe, a backlash is building against China for its initial mishandling of the crisis that helped loose the coronavirus on the world, creating a deeply polarizing battle of narratives and setting back China’s ambition to fill the leadership vacuum left by the United States.
China, never receptive to outside criticism and wary of damage to its domestic control and long economic reach, has responded aggressively, combining medical aid to other countries with harsh nationalist rhetoric, and mixing demands for gratitude with economic threats.
The result has only added momentum to the blowback and the growing mistrust of China in Europe and Africa, undermining Beijing’s desired image as a generous global actor.
With clear encouragement from President Xi Jinping and the powerful Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party, a younger generation of Chinese diplomats has been proving loyalty with defiantly nationalist and sometimes threatening messages in the countries where they are based.
“You have a new brand of Chinese diplomats who seem to compete with each other to be more radical and eventually insulting to the country where they happen to be posted,” said François Godement, a senior adviser for Asia at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne. “They’ve gotten into fights with every northern European country with whom they should have an interest, and they’ve alienated every one of them.”
Beirut’s nightlife survived a civil war. Can it withstand a pandemic?
In Beirut, it is both a cliché and a point of pride to say that the Lebanese partied straight through a civil war from 1975 to 1990, Times correspondent Vivian Yee writes. She shared some observations from the Lebanese capital.
The barhopping neighborhood of Mar Mikhaël in Beirut used to vibrate with the clip-clop of high heels and the car-stereo beat of Western and Arabic music almost every night.
But the bars and nightclubs have been shut down since early March; many had closed before that as the city was engulfed in an epochal economic crisis. The coronavirus could only conquer what remained, putting thousands more out of work.
Nightclub appearances by D.J.s who had flown in from Europe, hyped for weeks on social media and street posters, were abruptly canceled. Soon it was just restaurants and cafes, and then not even those.
Though Lebanon appears to have dodged a mass outbreak, allowing the government to announce a staggered reopening for businesses in the coming weeks, not all will come back. Now that the Lebanese pound buys less than half what it used to, imports and drinks alike cost more.
The government has proposed allowing clubs to reopen in early June, but Joe Mourani, the owner of Ballroom Blitz, a popular alternative electronic-music nightclub, doubts he will do so.
“Clubbing, it’s really all about proximity,” Mr. Mourani said. “It’s the opposite of social distancing.”
A local D.J., Priscilla Bakalian had a different view. She believes clubbers will return, if in smaller numbers.
“People are dying to go party,” she said. “It’s in our DNA.”
Boris Johnson said he received ‘liters and liters of oxygen’ while hospitalized with the virus.
Doctors had a plan to announce the death of Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain while he was hospitalized with the coronavirus last month, Mr. Johnson said in an interview with the tabloid The Sun on Sunday.
Mr. Johnson, who was discharged from St. Thomas’ Hospital in London in mid-April after spending three days in intensive care, spoke of his ordeal just days after he and his fiancée, Carrie Symonds, announced the birth of their son and as he prepared to lay out the government’s road map for easing the nation’s lockdown.
Mr. Johnson said that he had never before experienced anything as serious as the virus, which has killed at least 28,131 people in Britain.
Even after receiving “liters and liters of oxygen,” he said, he was not getting better and he could not understand why. “I was just incredibly frustrated,” he said, “because the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction and I thought, ‘There’s no medicine for this thing and there’s no cure.’”
Mr. Johnson and Ms. Symonds named their son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas, partly as a tribute to the two doctors, Nick Price and Nick Hart, whom they have praised as saving Mr. Johnson’s life. Ms. Symonds announced the name on Instagram, with a photograph of her and the infant.
Mr. Johnson plans to take a short paternity leave later in the year, but has put it off to deal with the epidemic, officials said. He is expected to set out a plan next week for winding down the country’s lockdown.
With Britain said to be past the peak of its outbreak, the Nightingale Hospital in London, an emergency center that was pulled together in about 10 days, is effectively being “wound down,” according to local news reports. It has taken in no new cases in the past week.
British news outlets have suggested that visitors coming from abroad may have to undergo a two-week quarantine. Eurostar passengers will be required to wear masks or face fines in France or Belgium, the rail company said.
At the same time, the pandemic is also widening inequality, especially in education, said the headmaster of Eton, the elite private school where several of the country’s prime ministers and royals were educated.
“The unfairness will become transparent, as it was in the Blitz when it was noted that houses in Belgravia were empty while the East End suffered,” the headmaster, Simon Henderson, told The Times of London. “Coronavirus hasn’t been a great leveler. It’s much harder if you are poor.”
Why does the virus hit some nations hard but deal a glancing blow to others?
Our correspondents Hannah Beech, Alissa J. Rubin, Anatoly Kurmanaev and Ruth Maclean examine a coronavirus puzzle .
The coronavirus has killed so many people in Iran that the country has resorted to mass burials, but in neighboring Iraq, the body count is fewer than 100.
The Dominican Republic has reported nearly 7,600 cases of the virus. Just across the border, Haiti has recorded about 85.
In Indonesia, thousands are believed to have died of the coronavirus. In nearby Malaysia, a strict lockdown has kept fatalities to about 100.
The coronavirus has touched almost every country on earth, but its impact has seemed capricious. Global metropolises like New York, Paris and London have been devastated, while teeming cities like Bangkok, Baghdad, New Delhi and Lagos have, so far, largely been spared.
The question of why the virus has overwhelmed some places and left others relatively untouched is a puzzle that has spawned numerous theories and speculations but no definitive answers. That knowledge could have profound implications for how countries respond to the virus, for determining who is at risk and for knowing when it’s safe to go out again.
Doctors in Saudi Arabia are studying whether genetic differences may help explain varying levels of severity in Covid-19 cases among Saudi Arabs, while scientists in Brazil are looking into the relationship between genetics and Covid-19 complications. Teams in multiple countries are studying if common hypertension medications might worsen the disease’s severity and whether a particular tuberculosis vaccine might do the opposite.
One theory that is unproven but impossible to refute: maybe the virus just hasn’t gotten to those countries yet. Russia and Turkey appeared to be fine until, suddenly, they were not.
U2, the Irish public health service and hundreds of ordinary people got together to fly in P.P.E. from China.
The four members of the Irish rock supergroup U2 contributed $10 million of their own cash toward a freelance operation to source desperately needed medical protection equipment in China and fly it to Ireland.
In a spontaneous collaboration involving the rock band, an Irish businessman living in China, an aircraft leasing company, hundreds of ordinary donors, and Ireland’s public health service, millions of items of equipment were purchased in China and flown back to Dublin on three chartered aircraft, the last of which landed on Sunday.
Dómhnal Slattery, chief executive of Avolon aircraft leasing, said that he was originally contacted last month by a China-based Irish businessman, Liam Casey of PCH International, who said he was looking for a way to move a planeload of personal protective equipment on behalf of an anonymous donor, which turned out to be the members of U2. Avolon subsequently set up a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for the air charters.
“The four members of U2 basically wrote a check for $2.5 million each,” Mr. Slattery said. “They put up the money for the P.P.E., Liam went and found it, and we brought it home.”
Mr. Slattery said that the last plane brought two million face masks, 32,000 surgical gowns and 40 ventilators.
“When the chips are down, Irish people come together,” Mr. Slattery said. “Hundreds of people around the country contributed fivers, tenners, fifty quid, towards the cost of the aircraft.”
And then there are those with even more to give. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter and Square, announced that he would donate $1 billion, or just under a third of his total wealth, to relief programs. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, said he would donate $100 million to American food banks through a nonprofit.
Oprah Winfrey has donated more than $10 million. And the “Harry Potter” creator J.K. Rowling has announced a donation of about $1.25 million to be split between groups helping the homeless and victims of domestic violence during the pandemic.
An Oxford researcher working on a vaccine says a new shot will likely be needed each year.
People will likely need annual vaccinations to protect against the coronavirus, just as is recommended for the flu, an Oxford University professor working on a vaccine predicted on Sunday.
Sir John Bell, the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, said on a U.S. Sunday news show, NBC’s “Meet the Press,” that while the coronavirus “doesn’t mutate at the pace of flu as far as we can see, it’s also quite a tricky virus in terms of generating longstanding immune responses to it.”
“As a result,” he said, “I suspect we may need to have relatively regular vaccinations against coronaviruses going into the future. That of course remains to be seen, but that’s my bet at the moment — that this is likely to be a seasonal coronavirus vaccine.”
Dr. Bell is involved in the development at Oxford of a potential vaccine for which the first few million doses could be available by September — at least several months ahead of any other announced efforts — if it proves to be effective.
“We are pretty sure we’ll get a signal by June about whether this works or not,” he said on the show.
Thousands of Palestinian workers have crossed into Israel, and there’s fear they could bring the virus home with them.
Throngs of Palestinian laborers traveled to their workplaces in Israel on Sunday even though Palestinian officials have repeatedly expressed concerns about them contracting the coronavirus there and carrying it back to the West Bank.
Ibrahim Milhim, a government spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, said that thousands of workers crossed into Israel on Sunday and that thousands more would do so later in the week.
Last week, an Israeli Defense Ministry body charged with liaising with the P.A. said Palestinians with permits to work in construction, agriculture and other sectors in Israel would be allowed to cross into the country. It also said their employers would be asked to provide them with accommodations until Eid al-Fitr, the festival at the conclusion of Ramadan in about three weeks.
Rami Mehdawi, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority Labor Ministry, said Palestinian officials remained concerned that infected workers could return to their homes and spread the virus, but he said the Palestinian authorities had worked with their Israeli counterparts to prevent such a scenario. Israel and the P.A. would closely coordinate the workers’ return to the West Bank, he said.
After Palestinian laborers were last permitted to travel to their jobs in Israel in late March, Palestinian officials accused Israeli authorities of abandoning some of them at checkpoints and allowing others to cross back to the West Bank through areas they don’t control.
The P.A. has said that more than 70 percent of the 336 known cases of the virus in the West Bank are linked to Palestinians employed in Israel.
Separately, for the first time since mid-March, schools opened for some grades in Israel on Sunday, but local authorities in several cities, including Tel Aviv, kept them closed, citing concerns about safety and preparedness.
On World Press Freedom Day, a new report warns of threats to journalists during the pandemic.
The pandemic is accelerating a decline in press freedoms around the world, with dozens of journalists being arrested and threatened for their coverage of the outbreak and governments abusing laws meant to target disinformation about the virus, a media watchdog group warned in a new report.
The report from the International Press Institute was released ahead of World Press Freedom Day, which is Sunday.
The group noted that press freedoms were being threatened even before the pandemic. But it said over the last two and a half months, it had found more than 50 cases in which journalists had been verbally or physically attacked for their coverage of the virus, mostly in Europe and Africa.
The group also found 16 cases in which countries — including Russia, Hungary and Azerbaijan — have used laws targeting disinformation to remove coverage about the virus or stifle criticism of officials’ response. In Vietnam and Algeria, officials have passed broader laws criminalizing disinformation, often with heavy penalties, the report found.
“It is crucial that extraordinary restrictions on media imposed during the crisis do not become normalized and outlive the immediate health crisis, especially when it comes to lack of transparency by governments, lack of access by media to decision makers and any form of surveillance hindering the press,” Barbara Trionfi, the executive director of the institute, said in a statement.
The group also noted that news outlets face renewed economic pressure because of declining advertising revenue.
A report published in April from the media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders arrived at similar conclusions, finding that the United States and Brazil were becoming models of hostility toward the news media and that China, Iran and Iraq were censoring coverage of the outbreak.
Pope Francis calls for ‘universal access’ to treatments and vaccines.
Pope Francis on Sunday called for everyone in the world to have access to vaccines and medical treatment for the coronavirus, urging nations to work together even as a global arms race for a vaccine intensifies.
Speaking from the Vatican library, where he has delivered his weekly messages to the faithful since Italy went into lockdown in March, Francis said he wished to “support and encourage the international collaboration” underway among researchers.
It was important, he said, to “unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and disinterested way, to find vaccines and treatments, and to guarantee universal access to essential technologies that allow every infected person, in every part of the world, to receive the necessary medical treatment.”
Scientists from around the globe have been working together and sharing their research on the virus for months. Last month, world leaders and global health experts pledged to accelerate the development of vaccines and treatments and ensure they would be universally available.
“Countries, health partners, manufacturers, and the private sector must act together and ensure that the fruits of science and research can benefit everybody,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the leader of the World Health Organization.
But in an era of increasing nationalism, the race to find a vaccine has revealed complex geopolitics. Whichever country gets a vaccine first has a chance to favor its own population and potentially gain the upper hand in dealing with the economic and geostrategic fallout from the crisis. There are also concerns that safety is being compromised in the rush to find a vaccine.
‘We are dying’: Russia’s small businesses, shut because of the virus, are withering away.
Russia has a “rainy day fund” of more than $550 billion, accumulated from oil sales when prices were high, so it is likely to weather the economic storm created by the coronavirus better than many countries, even as it recorded its worst one-day rise in cases since the outbreak began.
But it risks losing much of a sector that President Vladimir V. Putin has for years promoted as key to Russia’s long-term economic success: small and midsize businesses. Unlike many Western governments, the Kremlin has provided little support to business.
The overall relief package in Russia has amounted to less than a quarter of what is being injected in Germany, and most of the support has been aimed at helping large corporations, many of them owned or closely entwined with the state. Only around $10 billion has been pledged to small businesses so far.
As the coronavirus pandemic began to advance through Russian cities at the end of March, Mr. Putin ordered businesses to both shut down and continue paying salaries. But he did not specify where owners were supposed to get the money. Entrepreneurs have largely been left to fend for themselves, and the mass failure of small and medium businesses would leave Russia’s economy even more dependent on the Kremlin.
In defiance of Mr. Putin’s orders, Aleksandr B. Zatulivetrov announced that he would reopen one of his two restaurants in the center of St. Petersburg unless the Kremlin declared a state of emergency, a legal provision that would allow him to stop payments to banks and landlords and force the government to offer compensation.
“Where are your voices? We all have tens of workers who need jobs!” Mr. Zatulivetrov, 48, wrote in a plea to other restaurant owners to join him. ‘We are dying!”
Russia on Sunday reported 10,633 new confirmed cases — the highest single-day total so far and almost double the daily number just four days earlier. The government also reported 58 new deaths, for an overall total of 1,280.
More than half the new cases were in Moscow, which also has about half of Russia’s total: 134,687 cases. The city government said the higher one-day case total was in part a result of increased testing. The number of new coronavirus patients admitted to the hospital has remained steady at 1,700 per day, the Moscow government said, suggesting that the authorities were increasingly identifying cases at early stages of the illness.
The Philippines joins the list of countries suspending incoming commercial air travel.
The Philippines will suspend all commercial flights into the country beginning Sunday, joining several countries that have suspended most air travel in response to the pandemic.
The Manila International Airport Authority announced the move on its Facebook page. It did not give an end date for the suspension of commercial passenger flights, which began at 8 a.m. Sunday. Other air traffic, including cargo flights and those transporting medical supplies, will be allowed to continue, it said.
A handful of countries have similarly blocked almost all air travel in an effort to control the spread of the coronavirus, moves that coincide with new restrictions on migration that have been imposed around the world.
India suspended international and domestic passenger flights in late March. On Saturday the country’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation said the restrictions will be extended until May 17. Thailand will continue to bar most flights to the country until May 31.
Last month, Myanmar extended its suspension of all flights to the country until May 15. And Nepal said it would extend a suspension of all domestic and international flights until May 15.
The United Arab Emirates has suspended flights until further notice, and Argentina has banned commercial flights until Sept. 1, one of the longest such restrictions.
The International Civil Aviation Organization says international air travel could drop between 44 percent and 80 percent over the course of 2020, compared with the previous year. The overall reduction in the number of passengers could reach 1.5 billion, it said.
Can dogs sniff out the virus? Researchers in several countries are working to find out.
They can sniff out illegal drugs, dangerous explosives and even some diseases in humans. Could dogs help detect the coronavirus, too?
Researchers in countries like Britain, France and the United States are trying to answer the intriguing question as the authorities look for ways to quickly identify and isolate new cases to quash a possible second wave of infections once lockdowns are lifted.
The hope is that dogs will be able to supplement widespread testing, for instance by helping to screen airport passengers and detect any unwitting carriers of the coronavirus, in a quick, noninvasive way.
Dogs have already shown that they can detect cancer in blood, urine or breath samples, sniff out malaria, and warn owners with diabetes when their blood sugar has dropped too low.
“We know that diseases have got these unique odors,” Claire Guest, head of the Medical Detection Dogs charity in Britain, told the BBC last month, adding that training detection dogs usually takes six to eight weeks.
Ms. Guest’s charity, along with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Durham University, began training dogs in March to see if they would be able to single out samples. It is still unclear what the research will yield.
“It’s early days for Covid-19 odor detection,” Prof. James Logan, head of the Department of Disease Control at the London school, said in March. “We do not know if Covid-19 has a specific odor yet, but we know that other respiratory diseases change our body odor, so there is a chance that it does.”
Similar efforts are underway at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Medicine, where eight dogs are being exposed to samples of saliva and urine from coronavirus patients to see if the animals can identify positive samples in a laboratory setting and, ultimately, positive patients.
And in France, firefighters in Corsica are helping veterinarians conduct a trial using swabs from the armpits of coronavirus patients to see if dogs can detect the smell of the virus.
Curators around the world reimagine how, and if, we will gather for art.
The Prospect New Orleans art triennial in October has been postponed to next year. So has the Liverpool Biennial. São Paulo’s Bienal is delayed by at least a month. The Dakar Biennale has yet to set new dates. Front International, in Cleveland, has decided to skip 2021 altogether and return in 2022.
The coronavirus crisis has thrown into question the post-pandemic future of contemporary art biennials (and their cousins, triennials and quadrennials). Of an estimated such 43 exhibitions in 2020, some 20 have been postponed so far, according to a tally by the Biennial Foundation, with further changes near certain. The Biennale of Sydney opened in March for a three-month run — and had to close after 10 days.
The idea of the international art exhibition has flourished at least since the Venice Biennale was founded in 1895, but they have proliferated in the last two decades as the contemporary art field has gone global. Now their fate is linked to the big question of how culture industries, and cultural habits, will emerge from the pandemic. The crisis also threatens art fairs, which are driven by the market, itself facing great uncertainty, and the global ecosystem of workshops and residencies that have become vital to the careers of artists.
But the premise of a biennial is distinctly cosmopolitan and civic. The bet is that mingling artists, out-of-town visitors, and the local public — big biennials often draw a half-million attendees — around a theme that seeks to interpret the world, will benefit everyone involved, while helping cities boost their cultural profiles.
The lurking question is whether the biennial model still makes sense in a post-pandemic world.

Full text: The pandemic threatens to plunge half a billion people into poverty. The U.N. says it has raised just $1 billion of the $90 billion needed to aid poor regions.
This briefing has ended. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic here.
新冠病毒疫情最新消息
Millions who had risen out of poverty are pulled back in by the pandemic.
The gains the world was making in fighting poverty are at grave risk as the coronavirus brings countries to a grinding halt, forcing workers out of jobs they desperately need.
The World Bank says that for the first time since 1998, global poverty rates will rise. By the end of the year, 8 percent of the world’s population — half a billion people — could be pushed into destitution, largely because of the wave of unemployment brought by virus lockdowns, the United Nations estimates.
The developing world will be hardest hit. The World Bank estimates that sub-Saharan Africa will see its first recession in 25 years, with nearly half of all jobs lost across the continent. South Asia will probably experience its worst economic performance in 40 years.
Most at risk are people working in the informal sector, which employs two billion people who have no access to benefits like unemployment assistance or health care. In Bangladesh, one million garment workers — who make up 7 percent of the country’s work force — lost their jobs because of the global lockdowns.
One of them, Shahida Khatun, was laid off along with her husband in March as Bangladesh went under lockdown. Jobs at a factory had been their path out of poverty, but the loss of income has now thrust them back in, said Ms. Khatun, 22.
“My only dream was to ensure a proper education for my son,” she said. “That dream is now going to disappear.”
Russia’s prime minister says he is sick with Covid-19.
Russia’s prime minister, Mikhail V. Mishustin, said on Thursday that he was sick with Covid-19.
A fatigued-looking Mr. Mishustin, who is 54 and became prime minister in January, broke the news in a brief video conference with President Vladimir V. Putin that was broadcast on national television. He is the highest-ranking Russian official known to have been infected with the coronavirus.
“It just became known that my coronavirus tests had a positive result,” Mr. Mishustin told Mr. Putin in the televised meeting.
Later in the meeting, Mr. Mishustin addressed the general public: “I want to turn again to all the citizens of our country with the request that you take the coronavirus infection and its spread as seriously as possible.”
He told Mr. Putin he would self-isolate in accordance with the health authorities’ regulations.
Mr. Putin wished Mr. Mishustin good health and said he would accept the prime minister’s recommendation that Andrei R. Belousov, the first deputy prime minister, fill in for Mr. Mishustin temporarily.
“What is happening to you could happen to anyone,” Mr. Putin told Mr. Mishustin.
Mr. Mishustin is technically the second-most senior Russian official, but he is widely considered to be outside Mr. Putin’s inner circle. Before his surprise appointment by Mr. Putin as prime minister, Mr. Mishustin was the low-profile but technocratically proficient head of the Russian tax service.
Mr. Putin downplayed the pandemic in its early stages, but he has been forced to address it more seriously as the virus has spread fast through Russia.
As its neighbors cautiously step back from lockdowns, Britain signals that it needs more time.
While much of western Europe took steps toward lifting lockdown restrictions, Britain stood apart on Thursday, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson warning against allowing a pandemic resurgence, and making no promises about when the country might reopen.
“It is vital that we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain,” said Mr. Johnson, who recently recovered from his own, life-threatening bout of Covid-19.
He said the government would soon encourage people to wear face masks, saying they could help curb the contagion and give people confidence to return to work after the lockdown is lifted.
British officials offered some good news, saying that the country had passed a crucial threshold, with the reproductive rate of the infection falling below one. That means an infected person is spreading the virus to, on average, less than one other person, allowing the number of active infections to decline.
Mr. Johnson promised to lay out a road map next week for reopening the British economy, schools and offices, but he offered no timetable for putting it into effect. He listed a set of conditions that must be met, including solving problems in obtaining enough protective equipment.
With almost 27,000 coronavirus fatalities, Britain has nearly overtaken Italy as the country with the second-most confirmed deaths behind the United States.
Germany began easing its restrictions last week, allowing small shops to reopen, with social distancing rules still in place. Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday that houses of worship, playgrounds, museums, zoos and botanical gardens can now reopen, but that no major decisions would be made about schools until after May 6.
France’s government has announced plans to begin easing limits on movement and business on May 11.
In Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday that the country would reopen in stages, with restrictions relaxed by region, depending on local conditions. Most of Italy’s governors signed a letter asking the central government to ease the lockdown, allowing economic activity to resume.
U.S. presses Mexico to keep factories open despite illnesses.
The Trump administration and major U.S. manufacturers have pressured Mexico to keep factories that supply the United States operating during the coronavirus pandemic, even as outbreaks erupt and waves of cases and deaths sweep the companies.
Mexico must be responsive to the United States’ needs right now or, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico has said, risk losing the jobs that these factories provide.
“You don’t have ‘workers’ if you close all the companies and they move elsewhere,” Ambassador Christopher Landau said on Twitter. “Of course health comes first, but to me it seems myopic to suggest that economic effects don’t matter.”
Mexican officials have closed many factories and threatened legal action against those that remain open.
But the dispute highlights how much the two countries have come to depend on one another and how unequal that relationship remains.
Since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement over 25 years ago, Mexico has become a manufacturing mecca, attracting foreign-owned factories that employ hundreds of thousands of workers along the border and churn out everything from airplane parts to televisions, largely for the American market.
Now that the response to the coronavirus pandemic is shuttering businesses and factories in both countries, the United States is urging Mexico to allow exemptions for workers whose services are essential — not to Mexico, but to the United States.
Who should wear masks on planes? More airlines are saying everyone.
After flight attendants and pilots criticized them for not doing more to protect employees, large airlines in the United States and around the world announced this week that they would require their crews to wear masks. Some went even further and said passengers would have to do so, too.
American Airlines and Delta Air Lines said on Thursday that they would start requiring all passengers to wear a face covering in the coming weeks, a policy that will apply to their flight attendants, too. They join Lufthansa Group — which owns its namesake airline, Swiss International Air Lines and Austrian Airlines — as well as JetBlue and Frontier Airlines, all of which made similar announcements this week.
Southwest Airlines said this week that its flight attendants would soon be wearing masks, joining United Airlines, which announced a similar policy late last week. Both airlines said they would “strongly” encourage customers to do the same.
As some states begin to relax or lift stay-at-home orders, lawmakers and unions representing flight attendants and pilots have stepped up calls for industrywide rules on masks to protect flight crews from passengers — and passengers from one another.
Airlines have been slow to require masks in part because they’ve been hard to come by. Early in the pandemic, many companies promised to make masks available for employees who wanted them, but some pilots and flight attendants complained that they were not always available.
Is a treatment for Covid-19 already sitting on a shelf somewhere? Scientists are trying to find out.
Arthritis, leukemia and schizophrenia don’t have much in common with each other — or with Covid-19. But drugs used to treat those diseases are being considered as candidates to treat the new coronavirus.
In fact, scientists in many countries are examining thousands of drugs, developed for a dizzying array of other ailments, to see if they can also help with the current pandemic. Some are specifically antiviral drugs, but most are not; some are new, but many are decades old.
Researchers can make only rough guesses about which medicines are potential coronavirus treatments. An overwhelming majority will prove to be useless, but a handful are already showing promise.
“We don’t know a lot about why drugs do what they do,” said Matthew Frieman, a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.
After another deadly coronavirus disease, MERS, emerged in 2012, Dr. Frieman and others started testing established drugs against the new contagion. That work has given them a head start on finding contenders for Covid-19 treatments.
In other science news on the pandemic:

- Gilead Sciences said on Thursday that it planned to give away the first 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, an antiviral drug, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration grants emergency approval to use it as a coronavirus treatment. The drug, developed to treat Ebola, was ineffective for that purpose, but a current study shows that it may shorten the duration of Covid-19.

- A new report adds to growing doubts about the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as coronavirus treatments, though President Trump and conservative commentators have touted them repeatedly. The report from Harvard University researchers, posted on Thursday in a medical research journal, says that the research so far has found evidence that the drugs, used to treat malaria, can be harmful, and found no evidence that they help against the virus.

- An important tool for people who get sick with Covid-19 is simply keeping track of their symptoms, particularly things like shortness of breath, fever and blood oxygen levels (assuming they can find thermometers and pulse oximeters, which are in high demand). In people who take a turn for the worse, it tends to happen in the second week of the illness, and doctors and patients need to know when problems began and how they have changed.



The U.N. says $90 billion is needed to help poor regions weather the economic meltdown. It has $1 billion.
The top relief official at the United Nations says it will probably take $90 billion in humanitarian aid to protect vulnerable populations from the economic devastation of the pandemic — about 90 times what the international organization has managed to raise so far.
The official, Mark Lowcock, the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, gave the estimate in videoconference briefings with reporters this week. His office’s resources focus overwhelmingly on poorer parts of the world when disaster strikes.
While $90 billion may sound like a staggering figure, he said, it represents a tiny fraction of the roughly $8 trillion in economic stimulus money that governments around the world have pledged to counter the impact of the disease.
And providing aid sooner rather than later, he said, would mitigate the long-term and far costlier economic destruction that the most disadvantaged countries face from the pandemic.
“It’s a 1 percent investment — that’s a small thing to do,” he said. “It avoids a one-year problem becoming a 10-year problem.”
So far, in much of the developing world, the economic stimulus packages and support to those rendered unemployed because of the pandemic have been weak or nonexistent. At the same time, half a billion people will be pushed into poverty this year, reversing a 22-year decline.
Mr. Lowcock offered his cost estimate as the United Nations is intensifying calls for humanitarian donations just to meet the most immediate needs raised by the pandemic.
Secretary General António Guterres said on Thursday that the organization’s $2 billion response plan for the most vulnerable populations, which he announced last month, is only half filled. “The plan must be fully funded,” he said.
An E.U. report on coronavirus disinformation was not softened because of China’s protests, a top diplomat said.
Facing pointed criticism from lawmakers on Thursday, the European Union’s top diplomat denied that the bloc had softened a recent report on disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, under pressure from China.
The report, released late last week, described Chinese and Russian efforts to spread falsehoods and propaganda about the pandemic. But the language had been toned down amid strenuous objections from China, The New York Times reported, based on interviews, emails and documents.
The European Union’s senior diplomat, Josep Borrell, acknowledged that Chinese officials had objected to the report, but said such complaints “are the daily bread of diplomacy.” He said the revisions had been part of the normal editing process.
“There was no watering down of our findings,” Mr. Borrell said.
Lawmakers appeared skeptical. Thierry Mariani, a French member of the European Parliament, told Mr. Borrell that his team had been “caught with their hand in the cookie jar.”
The report comes at a time when the European Union hopes to win trade concessions from Beijing and restore a rich relationship once the pandemic has passed. German automakers and French farmers, along with other industries, rely heavily on exports to China.
The report was a routine roundup of publicly available information and news reports. The internal report, and a version that was drafted for public release, both dedicated separate sections to state-sponsored disinformation by China and Russia.
In the final version, those sections were folded into the rest of the report, and many examples of Chinese actions were grouped at the bottom, under the heading “Other selected activities.”
Key sentences from earlier versions were omitted, including: “China has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image.” Other language was softened.
“Who interfered? Which Chinese official put pressure? At what level? What means of pressure?” asked Hilde Vautmans, a Belgian member of the European Parliament. “I think Europe needs to know that. Otherwise you’re losing all credibility.”
Mr. Borrell declined to answer that question or discuss the revisions that had been made in each draft.
Can children hug their grandparents? The W.H.O. is exploring a safe way.
Switzerland is letting its youngest residents do something they needed no permission for before the pandemic: hug their grandparents.
With older people considered at higher risk from the coronavirus, officials have spent weeks advising grandparents the world against coming into contact with their grandchildren.
So when the Swiss authorities said on Wednesday that it was safe for children under 10 to hug their grandparents because scientists concluded that young children do not transmit the virus, the advice carried a caveat: Hugs should be brief.
The World Health Organization also chimed in on the debate, saying on Wednesday that it would explore whether such hugs were safe.
Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the W.H.O.’s emergencies program, acknowledged that grandparents were eager to hug their grandchildren, but cautioned that more research was required to better understand what role children play in the spread of the coronavirus.
“This is one of the living reviews we are currently working on,” she said at a news conference. “We are tracking all the studies evaluating this infection in children.”
France tries to nudge jittery commuters into bike lanes.
As France prepares to begin lifting its weeks-old travel restrictions, the government is encouraging people to get on their bikes to avoid jam-packed public transportation — an effort to keep virus-wary commuters from turning to cars, instead.
Beginning May 11, the French will be free to roam up to 100 kilometers — about 62 miles — from their homes, and mask-wearing in subway stations and buses will be mandatory for at least three weeks.
But the French government, worried about a second wave of infections, wants people to continue to practice social distancing, while also keeping carbon emissions and air pollution in check.
Élisabeth Borne, the transportation minister, announced a package of measures on Thursday totaling 20 million euros — about $22 million — that are meant to make cycling easier. She emphasized that 60 percent of trips made in France were of less than five kilometers.
“It’s a boost for bikes during the deconfinement period, to encourage people to choose this mode of transportation,” Ms. Borne told the newspaper Le Parisien, adding that biking “can’t replace everything” but that it would ease pressure on public transit and make it easier to comply with social distancing guidelines.
The measures include a €50 subsidy for bicycle repairs at certain shops, funds to help cities create temporary bike lanes and parking, and free cycling training programs. The government will also speed up the implementation of a recent law that helps employers cover travel costs up to €400 for workers who commute by bike or other environment friendly means.
Wall Street dips again as new jobless numbers climb.
With more than a million confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States and over 26 million people out of work, U.S. stocks followed European markets lower on Thursday as investors considered data revealing a sharp contraction in the eurozone economy and another surge of jobless claims in the United States.
The S&P 500 was down less than 1 percent in early trading, and European markets fell about 2 percent after a rally in Asia.
The Commerce Department this week reported the worst quarterly contraction in the nation’s economic output since 2008, during the Great Recession. The economy shrank 4.8 percent, and the worst is yet to come.
U.S. jobless numbers — with 3.8 million new claims in the past week — announced on Thursday brought the country’s six-week total to more than 30 million claims, despite trillions in stimulus spending and a rush to reopen shuttered businesses in some states.
As the nation surpassed 60,000 deaths from the virus and states began to reopen — Florida announced plans for Monday — President Trump and his advisers embraced optimism. The president pushed for a program to develop a vaccine, and the White House offered a revisionist history of the pandemic.
But while Mr. Trump has escaped direct criticism from Beijing over the United States’ handling of the coronavirus, China has instead found an outlet for its fury in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
China’s state television network called Mr. Pompeo the “common enemy of mankind” on Monday and then drove home the point over the next two nights. One commentator said that never before had a secretary of state “lowered the prestige of the United States so dramatically.”
The attacks appeared to signal an end to the rhetorical truce that Mr. Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, reached at the beginning of April. That truce, tenuous at best, has unraveled as the coronavirus has ravaged the United States.
The pandemic saps Putin’s image as a man of action.
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has long presented himself as a man of action and power, taking his country into wars in places like Syria and Georgia, crushing political foes, flying in a fighter jet — even stalking wild tigers.
But facing the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Putin has been unusually subdued, even passive. He seems less like a conquering hero than a bored monarch cooped up in his palace, checking his watch during video conferences with his underlings, as his popularity dips.
This was supposed to be a time of triumph for Mr. Putin, a celebration of restoring Russia’s pride about its place in the world, capped by a military parade in Red Square on May 9, the 75th anniversary of the Red Army’s victory over Nazi Germany. And he has been orchestrating a constitutional change to keep him in power until 2036.
But bowing to the inevitable, he called off the parade and a referendum on amending the Constitution.
The pandemic highlights Mr. Putin’s biggest vulnerability: intractable domestic problems that have never been his focus, like dilapidated hospitals, pockets of entrenched poverty and years of falling incomes.
He has staked much of his popularity on Russia’s revival as a great power, but the public is losing interest in foreign affairs, said Yekaterina Schulmann, a former member of the Kremlin’s advisory council for civil society and human rights — no longer willing to see the West “as an excuse for everything that has gone wrong at home.”
Mr. Putin was slow to acknowledge the viral threat, content to let other officials take the spotlight in handling it in February and March.
That has changed this month, when he has appeared almost daily on television, holding teleconferences from his country residence, but his heart does not seem to be in it.
“He gives an impression of being tired,” Ms. Schulmann said, “even bored.”
In South Korea and Hong Kong, a positive milestone: a day with no new local cases.
With social distancing and virus testing policies in place for months in several countries, a few governments are now reporting remarkable milestones: recording zero new domestically transmitted coronavirus cases, or no new cases at all.
South Korea on Thursday reported that for the first time since the virus’s Feb. 29 peak, it had no new domestic cases and just four cases among people who came in from outside the country. The development was a stark turnaround for a nation that was battered early on by the virus — with 909 cases on Feb. 29 alone — and quickly conducted widespread testing and contract tracing of new infections to halt the virus’s spread.
That progress has been mirrored in Hong Kong, which on Thursday reported that there had been no new cases in the semiautonomous Chinese territory for five straight days. The city has had more than 1,000 cases over all, and had a resurgence in infections in late March that prompted strict lockdowns on travel, including quarantining of foreign arrivals, social distancing measures and the widespread adoption of work-from-home policies.
Hong Kong residents overwhelmingly wear masks when going outside, even with the recent plunge in new cases.
Other countries are flirting with similar successes. Australia reported just nine new cases on Wednesday, and New Zealand had two days over the last week with just one new confirmed coronavirus infection.
Britain celebrates Tom Moore, the 100-year-old veteran who raised millions for health workers.
Britain threw a 100th birthday on Thursday like no other for a World War II veteran who grabbed his walker and took laps around his garden to hold a record-smashing fund-raising campaign for medical workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.
Britons flooded the one-man fund-raising juggernaut, Tom Moore, with more than 125,000 birthday cards, which were displayed at his grandson’s school. Members of the royal family sent congratulatory messages. The BBC sang him “Happy Birthday” as he was presented a cake topped with a model of a Spitfire warplane.
And Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday delivered a video message on Twitter to the veteran, calling him “a point of light in all our lives.”
Two World War II-era Royal Air Force planes, a Spitfire and a Hurricane, flew over Mr. Moore’s house in Bedfordshire, England, three times on Thursday as he sat outside with a shawl over his shoulders. Mr. Moore seemed tickled by the attention, thanking supporters and saying he was “honored.”
He originally set out to raise £1,000 by walking 100 laps of his garden, taking 10 laps a day. By Thursday morning, his fund-raising page had notched more than £30 million in donations for the overwhelmed National Health Service workers caring for infected patients, often at their own peril.
“That sort of thing makes you proud to be British, doesn’t it?” Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, said in a video released by Clarence House. Mr. Moore was promoted to the rank of honorary colonel of the Army Foundation College, a move approved by the queen.
Britain’s government has drawn criticism for its management of the pandemic, especially in relation to older people, who account for many fatalities. More than 4,300 deaths involving Covid-19 were registered in care homes across England from April 10 to April 24, according to the Office of National Statistics. Britain has had more than 165,000 confirmed infections and over 26,000 deaths.
‘I want to walk on the grass’: Beijing reopened parks and museums.
Beijing’s major tourist sites are reopening just in time for China’s extended holiday weekend, the latest sign that life in China is slowly returning to normal amid the coronavirus epidemic.
The Forbidden City announced plans on Wednesday to partly reopen on May 1, China’s Labor Day. To encourage social distancing, museum authorities are staggering tour times and limiting the number of visitors to 5,000 per day, a sharp reduction from the 80,000 people who typically pass through the sprawling complex in the heart of China’s capital city. Several sections of the palace grounds will remain closed to visitors.
Tickets for the five-day holiday sold out within hours of the announcement.
He Handi, 26, was one of the many who tried unsuccessfully to get tickets to the Forbidden City. But after weeks of being cooped up inside, she was determined to soak up the sunshine, so she made plans with friends to go the Summer Palace and two other Beijing parks instead.
“It’s still spring,” said Ms. He, who works at an internet company. “I want to walk on the grass.”
The National Museum of China, just steps away from the Forbidden City, and Nanluoguxiang, a popular traditional alleyway lined with trinket and snack shops, have also announced plans to reopen by the weekend to a limited number of people. After partly reopening in March, the Great Wall of China said it would expand the number of areas accessible to visitors.
In what has become the new normal around the city, visitors at all tourist sites will be required to undergo a screening that includes showing a QR code connected to the person’s health status and travel history as well as a temperature check.
The announcements came on the same day that China said it would hold a long-delayed top political gathering in Beijing late next month. Since the outbreak began in January, Beijing — home to China’s political elite — has been subject to some of the strictest restrictions in the country outside Hubei, the province where the virus first emerged. Restrictions on mask-wearing in public places and travel to the city are also being loosened.
Spain and Portugal share a peninsula, but their outbreaks are worlds apart.
The neighboring nations of Spain and Portugal are a study in how two places that share a 750-mile border can diverge drastically in both their experience of the coronavirus and in the political consensus around plans to combat it.
As both Iberian nations appear to be emerging from the worst of their current outbreaks, Portugal’s government on Thursday will present a plan to ease its nationwide lockdown, broadly in line with that of neighboring Spain. But the reopening is likely to advance at a different pace given how different the nations’ outbreaks have been.
Portugal has registered far fewer confirmed infections and deaths from the virus than Spain, which has the highest number of confirmed cases in Europe. Portugal is nearing 1,000 confirmed deaths from the virus out of 10 million residents, while Spain, which is home to 47 million people, is closing in on 25,000 fatalities.
As Spain saw its hospitals and morgues overwhelmed, particularly in the Madrid region, Portugal’s outbreak progressed at a far slower rate.
There is no clear explanation for the contrast, but some experts have noted that Portugal’s extensive testing and early attempts to curtail the movement of people earlier in its outbreak may have helped. When Portugal went into lockdown in mid-March, it had registered only two deaths, compared with 120 when Spain took the same step.
And the political climate in the neighboring nations has been markedly different. Both countries have Socialist prime ministers who lead minority governments, but António Costa, Portugal’s leader, has received unwavering support from other political parties for his handling of the epidemic.
Mr. Costa has repeatedly warned against complacency. On Monday, he said that his government would not hesitate to reverse course if the country had a pickup in the infection rate in coming weeks. “If things start to go wrong, we have to take a step backward,” he told local reporters while visiting a clothing company that is producing face masks.
Portugal is expected to allow small shops, hairdressers and bookstores to reopen on Monday, while child care centers and big shopping malls will open on June 1, according to local news media reports.
A plan presented this week by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain to return the country to a “new normalcy” by the end of June has received strong criticism from opposition leaders.
Trump officials are said to have pushed spies to hunt for unproven links between the virus and a lab in Wuhan.
Senior Trump administration officials have pushed American spy agencies to hunt for evidence to support an unsubstantiated theory that a government laboratory in Wuhan, China, was the origin of the outbreak, according to current and former American officials. The effort comes as Mr. Trump escalates a public campaign to blame China for the pandemic.
Some intelligence analysts are concerned that the pressure from administration officials will distort assessments about the virus and that they could be used as a political weapon in an intensifying battle with Beijing over the outbreak that has infected more than three million people across the globe.
Most intelligence agencies remain skeptical that conclusive evidence of a link to a lab can be found, and scientists who have studied the genetics of the coronavirus say that the overwhelming probability is that it leapt from animal to human in a nonlaboratory setting, as was the case with H.I.V., Ebola and SARS.
Reporting for The New York Times, Mark Mazzetti, Julian E. Barnes, Edward Wong and Adam Goldman investigate how scientists, spies and government officials have wrestled for months with varying theories about how the outbreak began. Many agree on the importance of determining the genesis of the pandemic. In government and academia, however, experts have ruled out the notion that it was concocted as a bioweapon. And they agree that the new pathogen began as a bat virus that evolved naturally, probably in another mammal, to become adept at infecting and killing humans.
A few veteran national security experts have pointed to a history of lab accidents infecting researchers to suggest it might have happened in this case, but many scientists have dismissed such theories.
The E.C.B. will pay banks to lend money to respond to the economic crisis.
The European Central Bank said on Thursday it would effectively pay banks to lend money as it vowed to do whatever is necessary to counteract the economic impact of the coronavirus.
Christine Lagarde, the bank’s president, said at a news conference that the eurozone economy could shrink as much as 12 percent this year. The downturn is “unprecedented in peacetime,” she said.
Under certain conditions the central bank will allow commercial banks in the eurozone to borrow at a rate of minus 1 percent if the money is passed on to businesses and consumers. The negative interest rate means that banks do not need to pay back all of the money that they borrow.
The central bank also said it was prepared to increase its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a form of money printing that aims to keep market interest rates low and make it easier for businesses and individuals to get credit.
The central bank, which had previously earmarked more than 1 trillion euros, or $1.1 trillion, for asset purchases, said on Thursday that it was prepared to increase that “as much as necessary and for as long as needed.”
Drug company reaches an agreement to make and distribute a potential vaccine.
The British-based pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca said on Thursday that it had reached an agreement to make and distribute a potential coronavirus vaccine. The drug, developed by scientists at Oxford, is now in human trials.
The Oxford researchers had already demonstrated the safety of similar potential inoculations for other viruses. That has enabled them to schedule human trials of their vaccine that will involve 6,000 people by the end of next month.
If those succeed, the scientists hope to distribute the first few million doses to front-line health care workers as early as September. The deal with AstraZeneca could help ensure that a potential vaccine is available in the United States and around the world.
The scientists previously reached agreements for companies in Europe and Asia to make the drug. But until now the team had not lined up a North American distributor, in part because pharmaceutical giants like AstraZeneca that dominate that market usually depend on profit from exclusive marketing rights.
Under the agreement, AstraZeneca, which is based in Cambridge and includes a large U.S. subsidiary, “would be responsible for development and worldwide, manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine,” the company said in a statement.
Mene Pangalos, the executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, said in an interview that the company had acquired the worldwide exclusive license to sell the vaccine. If it works, he said, the organization would initially seek to produce as many doses as possible at a low cost, potentially in cooperation with the producers already lined up by the Oxford scientists.
But if the pandemic evolves into a recurring outbreak or seasonal flare-ups, the company could seek to profit from vaccine sales. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
“What we are worrying about now is supply during the pandemic,” Mr. Pangalos said. “If this becomes like a flu vaccine, could we commercialize it? The answer is yes.”
Fleeing cities, Peruvians seek safety in the countryside.
An urban exodus is convulsing Peru as city dwellers pour out to the countryside to live with their families.
In Lima, the capital, the bus terminals are so crowded with those waiting to escape that families are sleeping outside, side by side. Highways are lined with people on foot, laden with suitcases and children.
“We brought just a small suitcase,” said Wilson Granda, 28, an unemployed waiter, speaking from a bus terminal where his young family had been waiting for four days for a ride to his parents’ farm.
In all, at least 167,000 Peruvians in urban areas have registered with local governments, asking for help leaving cities.
Peru is emerging as one of the Latin American countries hardest hit by the pandemic, according to official counts. The country of about 30 million people is second only to Brazil, with about 30,000 confirmed cases, most of them in Lima.
Now, Peru is experiencing a reverse exodus of sorts.
For decades, rural families traveled from the countryside to Lima in search of work. That migration changed the face of the country, turning it into one of the more urbanized nations in the world.
The flow of people is part of larger virus-related migration patterns around the world that are raising alarm about the spread of contagion into rural areas, and worrying small-town officials who are ill-prepared to support large groups of new people.

Full text: The United States is finally getting clues about how widespread the novel coronavirus really is among the population.
Antibody testing being conducted by states, localities and private companies is helping officials determine how many people were infected without realizing it. 
The early results are offering some hopeful signs about the severity of the pandemic – and some not as optimistic. 
The good: The virus is less deadly than initially thought. The bad: It is more deadly than the seasonal flu. And "herd immunity" is still far off.
Officials in New York, California, Florida and Colorado have preliminary results. In New York City, nearly 1 in 4 people tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced this week. Across the entire state, 15 percent had coronavirus antibodies. It's likely that infections spread much further in New York City – which is the source of roughly 1 in 5 of the more than 58,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States –  than in other parts of the country, given the city's urban density and relative slowness to shut down.
In Miami-Dade County, Florida, officials say antibody testing indicates that between 4.4 and 7.9 percent of the population has been infected.
Officials in Los Angeles, which locked down several days before New York, reported an even lower rate of positive antibody tests, saying their research indicates between 2.8 and 5.6 percent of the population has already been infected with the virus.
And in the ski town Telluride, Colo., just a tiny fraction of the processed antibody tests came back positive: 26 out of 4,757. 
The data shows that at least 10 times as many people were infected with the virus as were diagnosed with covid-19. It underscores the reality that many people are hardly affected by the coronavirus. "Many people experience mild symptoms or none at all, and never get the standard diagnostic test with a swab up the nose, so they're missed in the official covid-19 case counts," my colleague Joel Achenbach writes.
And many Americans haven't been able to get tested even if they had mild symptoms because of strict state rules seeking to preserve limited testing materials for medical workers and those living in group settings. 
Higher infection rates translate to lower fatality rates.  The true fatality rate — which has been exceedingly hard to determine because the total number of infections isn't known — now appears below 1 percent. New York City's antibody tests indicate an infection fatality rate of between 0.5 and 0.8 percent. 
Yet that number still translates to a lot of people nationally, as The Atlantic's Yascha Mounk notes: "Even if the virus has a fatality rate of a little less than 1 percent, this means that letting it spread through the population of the United States would cause about 2 million deaths." 
And there's a flip side: People with no symptoms can still easily transmit the highly infectious disease to those more vulnerable to it, especially the elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions.
The infection rate doesn't appear anywhere close to the point of "herd immunity."  The point at which a disease's transmission halts naturally is typically if about 60 to 70 percent of the population is exposed to the virus. 
A sizable majority of the American public hasn't yet gotten the virus, so the potential for severe illness and death is still quite high. A 0.5 fatality rate is considerably higher than the seasonal flu's fatality rate, which is probably less than 0.1 percent.
"As infectious disease experts point out, even a seemingly low rate can translate into a shockingly large death toll if the virus spreads through a major portion of the population," Joel writes.
Serology tests detecting past coronavirus infections are popping up all over the country. Quest Diagnostics, one of the largest networks of commercial laboratories, announced yesterday that individuals can purchase antibody tests through its website for $120 without having to first get a doctor's order. Test results will be available one to two days after the blood is drawn at a Quest lab, and a doctor will be available to discuss the results with the patient, the company said.
Antibody surveys have been started by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and colleges and universities around the nation. 
AHH: President Trump will order meat plants to stay open.  Trump is expected to sign an executive order to require meat production plants to stay open, ensuring continued food supply during the pandemic. Trump will invoke the Defense Production Act to classify meat plants as essential, Taylor Telford and Kimberly Kindy report, citing a person familiar with the plan.  
The Post has found at least 20 meatpacking plants have closed in recent weeks because of covid-19 outbreaks. "The government will provide additional protective gear for employees as well as guidance," Taylor and Kimberly write. "… The government order would keep meat companies from using the most effective weapon available to protect their employees — closures." 
The United Food and Commercial Workers said at least 17 workers have died of covid-19. The CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have released interim guidance for such facilities, including ways to ensure safe distance between employees and procedures for cleaning shared equipment. 
Industry analysts say pork and beef processing has fallen 25 percent because of these outbreaks. "Major meat companies, including Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods and JBS USA, have repeatedly touted their essential role in the nation's food supply chain, often resisting calls from government officials and labor advocates to close their facilities due to outbreaks," Taylor and Kimberly write.
OOF: The adviser helping to shape Trump's China policy is deeply distrustful of the regime in Beijing. He covered it as a reporter for Reuters and the Wall Street Journal. As the virus was spreading beyond China's borders in February, deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger believed Chinese leaders were engaging in a massive coverup and a "psychological warfare" operation to obscure the origins of the virus and deflect blame, David Nakamura, Carol D. Leonnig and Ellen Nakashima report. 
"U.S. intelligence officials were picking up signs that Chinese operatives were deliberately sowing disinformation, including state media manipulating stories to change key facts," they write, adding that Pottinger's personal experience as a journalist in China two decades ago "left him deeply distrustful of the regime in Beijing and is now shaping the administration's hard-line posture."
"Pottinger believes Beijing's handling of the virus has been 'catastrophic' and 'the whole world is the collateral damage of China's internal governance problems,' " a person familiar with his thinking told our colleagues. 
The 46-year-old is now a pivotal player in the administration's attempts to make U.S. policy on China more confrontational. "In private, Pottinger has described [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] as steering China's authoritarian system toward a more dangerous 'totalitarianism,' seeking to implement Orwellian-style controls over most aspects of society," David, Carol and Ellen write.
OUCH: The White House abruptly reassigned the head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement it viewed as soft on immigration. The director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Jonathan Hayes, was reassigned with little notice, World Magazine's J.C. Derrick and Harvest Prude report. 
It was a move that shocked ORR staff as well as the former director's supervisors, including HHS Secretary Alex Azar. Hayes was praised by people across sides of the aisle, especially as he led the office that was at the center of the president's controversial 2018 child separation policy. Hayes was made director of the office in early 2019.
"Anti-immigration hard-liners—led by presidential adviser Stephen Miller—saw Hayes as soft on immigration and ousted him while the nation's attention was focused on the exploding pandemic," J.C. and Harvest write. "Now, they've imported new leaders in an effort to refashion ORR into an arm of immigration enforcement—sparking concerns that the child-separation policy Melania and Ivanka Trump intervened to stop may return in another form."
Even though immigration has been temporarily halted during the pandemic, the change could have long-term effects. 
Vice President Pence chose not to wear a face mask while visiting the Mayo Clinic.  It was an apparent violation of the Minnesota medical center's policy, as well as a move that flouted the administration's own recommendations, Felicia Sonmez reports. 
Pence later defended the decision by saying he is frequently tested for the virus. 
"As vice president of the United States, I'm tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus," Pence said.
After visiting the clinic, Pence told reporters: "Since I don't have the coronavirus, I thought it'd be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers, these incredible health-care personnel, and look them in the eye and say thank you."
The CDC's guidelines on wearing masks — which note that they're helpful for preventing coronavirus transmission — don't specify whether someone who has been tested recently should still wear a covering, Felicia writes. 
The clinic posted a notice on its website that as of April 13 it is "requiring all patients and visitors to wear a face covering or mask to help slow the spread of COVID-19."
In a since-deleted tweet, the clinic said it "had informed @VP of the masking policy before his arrival today."

An emergency room doctor and head of the Committee to Protect Medicare:
Vox's Aaron Rupar:
A coalition of hospitals, health insurers and businesses want lawmakers to support uninsured Americans.  More than 30 organizations, mostly health-care industry trade associations, sent a letter to congressional leaders with suggestions for how to help the growing number of Americans who are losing coverage as they lose their jobs.  
"The magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis is extraordinary. It has taxed our health care system like never before, and it has stressed the economy as consumers and businesses limit commerce and adhere to social distancing to reduce the transmission of the disease," the letter reads. 
"These actions have undoubtedly saved lives, but they also have cost millions of jobs — more than 26 million by the latest employment reports. Because nearly 180 million Americans get their health care coverage through their work, it is critical to ensure millions of Americans continue to have employer coverage." 
"The groups are hoping to influence a next relief package being debated on Capitol Hill," Amy Goldstein reports in the live blog. "The options, which industry leaders call a 'menu,' include new subsidies to employers to help them preserve health benefits during the pandemic, as well as helping more Americans afford to buy health plans through Affordable Care Act marketplaces by subsidizing premiums up to a higher income threshold."
Here are a few more headlines to catch up on this morning:
The hardest hit:  Patients with cancer, especially patients with blood or lung malignancies or tumors that have spread in the body, are at a higher risk of dying of covid-19, a new study has found, Laurie McGinley reports.
More on the Trump administration:  The president's aides and allies are hoping to soon refocus him away from public health updates on the pandemic, a change that follows his dangerous suggestion that injecting bleach or other disinfectants could cure the virus, Ashley Parker reports. Instead, Trump will talk about the economic fallout and recovery.
Congress on coronavirus:  House leaders scrapped a plan to bring lawmakers back to Washington next week, citing warnings from the attending physician of Congress that bringing them back would put lawmakers and staff at risk, Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report. "Meanwhile, many logistical questions remain unsettled as the Senate plots its return," they add.
Good to know:  Pfizer's chief executive told CNBC the company is preparing to manufacture vaccines in the United States and Europe. They hope to be able to supply millions of doses of vaccines this year and hundreds of millions in 2021.
On the front lines:  Children of doctors and nurses fighting the pandemic are having nightmares, recording worries in journals and writing goodbye letters to parents they worry they won't see again, John Woodrow Cox reports.
An analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine examines 29 different approaches for how to prioritize ventilators if there's a shortage, Ariana Eunjung Cha reports.
There's a growing demand for abortion through telemedicine, as a wave of states and the administration restricts access to the procedure. Women can have a video visit with a doctor before receiving abortion pills in the mail, the New York Times's Pam Belluck reports.
Thinking about a new normal:  Americans remain concerned about becoming ill. A new Post-University of Maryland poll found nearly two-thirds of Americans say restrictions in restaurants, retail stores and other businesses in their state are appropriate, and 16 percent say they're not strict enough, Dan Balz and Scott Clement report. That's compared with 17 percent who say the limits are too restrictive.
Researchers say cellphone location data found that for a second week, people stayed home less, signaling a "quarantine fatigue" in the United States, Katherine Shaver reports.

Full text: The question of when to relax stay-at-home orders has become the latest front in the culture war, a conflict fanned by President Trump during his daily White House briefings. But a new Washington Post-University of Maryland poll shows that protesters agitating for governors to quickly lift restrictions represent the fringe more than the mainstream.
Just 10 percent of Americans predict that gatherings of 10 or more people would be safe by the end of April or earlier. Another 21 percent expect them to be safe by the end of May. But the other two-thirds of U.S. adults say it may take until June or later for people to safely congregate in groups of 10 or more.
Predictably, a partisan divide has emerged on this question: 77 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they expect public gatherings will not be safe until June or later, compared with 51 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents.
But Republicans who say they are personally concerned about getting sick are much more likely to say it will take longer for gatherings to become safe again. This might seem intuitive, but it's significant because at least 4 in 10 people in every political and demographic group worry about getting seriously ill from the novel coronavirus. And people's sense of personal vulnerability appears to be a significant factor in shaping attitudes as the debate over sheltering in place heats up from state to state.
Overall, 57 percent of Americans worry about becoming infected and seriously ill as a result of the virus: 20 percent are very worried, while 37 percent are somewhat worried. Meanwhile, 27 percent said they're not too worried, while 16 percent say they are not worried at all. Worry is lower among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, but still common: 43 percent are at least somewhat worried, while 57 percent are less concerned. 
Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who are less worried about becoming infected and seriously ill, 60 percent expect public gatherings of 10 or more people will be safe by the end of May or earlier. But among Republicans who are at least somewhat concerned about becoming seriously sick from the coronavirus, 66 percent say this will take until June at the earliest. There's a much narrower divide among Democrats on this metric.
The poll also reflects partisan differences over who is following a recent recommendation by public health officials that people should begin wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Two-thirds of adults say they've worn a face mask or face covering when leaving home in the past week. While 26 percent of Republicans said they did not do so, 10 percent of Democrats said that. Another 22 percent of Democrats said they have not left the house at all in the past week, compared to 13 percent of Republicans.
Americans of all partisan stripes are anxious. Seven in 10 adults say the outbreak is a source of stress in their own life, including clear majorities of both Democrats and Republicans. A growing number of Americans feel more directly impacted by the coronavirus: 26 percent said they know someone who has been diagnosed, 14 percent said they know someone who has been hospitalized and 9 percent said they know someone who has died from it.
Half the respondents said the contagion has caused personal financial hardship in their household. About 1 in 3 Americans are concerned about paying bills over the next month. Nearly half of Hispanics are concerned about affording food or other basic items, as are 39 percent of blacks and 23 percent of whites. While 37 percent think the economy will recover quickly, 63 percent expect a slow recovery.
On the political side, 54 percent of Americans give Trump negative marks for how he's handled the outbreak. "By contrast, 72 percent of Americans give positive ratings to the governors of their states for the way they have dealt with the crisis, with workers also rating their employers positively," Scott Clement and Dan Balz report in a broader story on the results.
The poll was conducted by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement. Interviews were conducted April 14-19 among a random national sample of 1,013 adults, 69 percent of whom were reached on cellphones and 31 percent on landlines. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Gov. Brian Kemp (R) set Georgia on an aggressive reopening course.  One of the last governors to issue a statewide stay-at-home directive is among the first to pull back on the restrictions, prompting an outcry from public health experts. Kemp announced he will allow gyms, barber shops, tattoo parlors and bowling alleys, among other businesses, to reopen on Friday. He said theaters and dine-in restaurants would be permitted to resume activity on April 27. And he will allow the statewide shelter-in-place order to expire at the end of the month. Georgia ranks 42nd in testing per capita, Isaac Stanley-Becker reports. Georgia has reported nearly 20,000 cases and 775 deaths. 
The only other state pursuing as swift a strategy as Georgia is South Carolina, where Gov. Henry McMaster (R) allowed a range of retail stores to reopen Monday. The state has had nearly 4,500 cases and 124 deaths.
Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) said he would let his stay-at-home order expire at the end of the month. "Social distancing must continue, but our economic shutdown cannot," he said.
Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) excluded Democrats from his "Re-Open Florida Task Force." "The task force's members include executives at Walt Disney World and Universal Studios — two of the state's largest employers — as well as other corporate executives and elected leaders," Lori Rozsa reports. "DeSantis said Florida can 'bounce back in a very thoughtful, safe, and efficient way,' and having fast, reliable coronavirus tests available is the key to doing so. He floated one idea Monday: perform rapid coronavirus tests on guests as they check into hotels. But he stressed that the tests must be reliable. … DeSantis said Florida is due to get 100,000 additional rapid coronavirus tests this week … DeSantis's task force is heavy on business leaders and also includes all but one member of his cabinet — Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only statewide elected Democrat."

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) bought 500,000 tests from South Korea. Hogan said "the Trump administration 'made it clear over and over again' that states 'have to go out and do it ourselves,'" Fenit Nirappil, Erin Cox and Gregory Schneider report. "The $9 million shipment is equivalent to one test for about every 12 Marylanders — a major step toward meeting the state's goal of testing 10,000 a day, Hogan said. As of Monday morning, public and private labs had administered 71,397 coronavirus tests for Marylanders. The governor said he wants to double Maryland's daily testing goal to 20,000 and cautioned that the state needs other supplies, such as swabs and reagents. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, both Democrats, have also cited broader testing as an important milestone to reach before they and Hogan can consider a coordinated easing of restrictions in the greater Washington region, where the reported coronavirus caseload climbed past 25,000 on Monday. Fatalities in the District, Maryland and Virginia nearly reached the 1,000 mark."
Hogan credited his wife, Yumi, with helping to secure the tests. "Yumi Hogan is believed to be the first Korean American first lady of any state and has been the catalyst for 'the special bond' between Maryland and South Korea, where Yumi Hogan has almost taken on a celebrity status," Ovetta Wiggins reports.
The virus has mostly spared Wyoming so far, but that may not last.  "There were protests [in Cheyenne] Monday arguing that all restrictions should be lifted in the Cowboy State, which has seen the lowest number of confirmed cases in the nation — 317 through Monday — in part because of its low population and wide open spaces. The death toll in Wyoming thus far? Two," Robert Klemko reports. "The state is one of eight in the country without a statewide stay-at-home order, but it does have a limit on gatherings of more than 10 people and has ordered nonessential businesses to close, albeit with one of the broadest definitions of what that means. … Cheyenne Mayor Marian Orr (R) has been warning her constituents that the worst is yet to come. … 
"Gov. Mark Gordon (R) emerged from his office just after noon to address protesters, reading scripture and asking them not to be anxious and instead to pray to God for peace. He calmly answered questions, told them that he is in lockstep with Trump's concerns and approaches, and reiterated that the state needs to move cautiously to control the virus. … Gordon [noted] that Wyoming's hospitals are filling and that it has had to send some cases from the area around Jackson Hole to hospitals in Utah and Idaho because of a lack of capacity."
Trump teased an order to temporarily suspend immigration.  "Trump announced in a tweet late Monday night that he plans to suspend immigration to the United States, a move he said is needed to safeguard American jobs and defend the country from the coronavirus pandemic, which he called 'the Invisible Enemy,'" Nick Miroff, Josh Dawsey and Teo Armus report. "Trump, who is running for reelection on his immigration record and his effort to build a wall on the Mexico border, has long been frustrated with the limits on his ability to seal off the United States by decree. An executive order suspending all immigration to the country would take the president's impulses to an untested extreme. Two White House officials said an executive order is being drafted and that Trump could sign it as soon as Tuesday. The order, which was discussed among senior staff members Monday, would suspend nearly all immigration under the rationale of preventing the spread of infection by foreigners arriving from abroad. … 
"It remains unclear what exceptions Trump could include in such a sweeping immigration order, or if would-be immigrants could reach the United States by demonstrating they are free of the virus. The White House officials said they thought the order would not be in place long-term. The president's announcement caught some senior Department of Homeland Security officials off guard … Halting immigration to the United States could affect hundreds of thousands of visa holders and other would-be green card recipients who are planning and preparing to come to the United States at any given time. Most of them are the family members of Americans."

The GOP is facing heat after its program to help small businesses benefited large corporations.  "As Congress and the White House near a deal to add an additional $310 billion to the [Paycheck Protection Program], some are calling for additional oversight and rule changes to prevent bigger chains from accepting any more money," Jonathan O'Connell reports. "In all, more than 70 publicly traded companies have reported receiving money from the program." When asked about it, Trump blamed community banks. But many big companies receiving money are clients of JPMorgan Chase, adding fuel to criticism that big Wall Street banks are helping their clients take advantage of a program that was not intended for them.
Trump and Congress are working through last-minute snags to secure new funds. If a deal is reached, the nearly $500 billion measure would become the fourth virus-related bill rushed through Congress in two months. (Erica Werner)

The federal government unveiled a plan to transition back toward normal operations.  "The memo, issued by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management, says officials will 'ramp back up government operations to the maximum extent possible, as local conditions warrant.' It does not offer specific deadlines, noting that the federal government will calibrate its strategy in alignment with state, county and regional reopening efforts," Michael Brice-Saddler and Steven Goff report. "It says federal agencies should expand telework flexibilities to all eligible workers categorized as 'higher risk for serious complications from covid-19.' … New policies must also 'restrict individuals infected with or at higher risk for serious illness from covid-19 from accessing federal facilities,' it says."
Surgeon General Jerome Adams has been sidelined.  The Trump administration took him "off television last week after his controversial remarks on Covid-19's threat to minorities, silencing the White House's loudest voice on racial disparities even as concerns mount about risks to communities of color," Politico reports. "Adams made just one TV appearance last week, a steep decline from the 10-plus TV appearances he made the prior week. … The surgeon general received multiple requests for high-profile media appearances last week that the White House didn't accept … Adams also hasn't made an appearance at a White House press briefing since April 10."
When covid-19 claimed two of their own, these EMTs grieved and kept on going. "The caller was 18 years old. He was from Peru and lived with his father, just the two of them, everyone else back at home. The father, 56, had tested positive for covid-19 and now the son was unable to wake him from his bed," Ariana Eunjung Cha reports from North Bergen, N.J. "When Dave Prina and the other EMTs arrived, there was nothing to do but express condolences and ask for the father's identification for the paperwork. What's the boy going to do? he wondered. How will he live? How will he pay next month's rent? 'When we left, he was hysterical on the stairs,' Prina recalled. The ambulance call that haunts him is one of thousands during a relentless three weeks in which this region has become the world's coronavirus epicenter. North Bergen is located at the other end of the Lincoln Tunnel from New York City. … At least 13 EMTs and 50 police officers and firefighters nationwide have died of covid-19-related complications in recent weeks. … Two of the dead are this area's own: Kevin Leiva was a 24-year-old EMT in North Bergen. Israel 'Izzy' Tolentino Jr., a 33-year-old father of two, was a firefighter and EMT from neighboring Passaic."
"I have been an EMT for 25 years. I see death all the time. I have seen some awful things. But it's the repetition that gets me. If you go on shift now, it is a guarantee you will see death," said Prina.
Nearly 1 in 10 nursing homes nationwide have identified patients with the virus. 
The Post "compiled a nationwide list of more than 1,300 nursing homes, with a death count that has spiraled into the thousands. The list is far from complete. More than half a dozen states with significant outbreaks — including Maryland and Virginia where dozens of nursing home residents have died — have not released the names of facilities with cases of the virus," Debbie Cenziper, Joel Jacobs and Shawn Mulcahy report. "On Sunday, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced new reporting requirements, mandating that nursing homes inform residents, their families and the federal government about cases of covid-19. Under the new rules, the [CDC] will collect the information. … Some nursing home watchdog groups, however, said the guidance was vague and that facilities can't accurately report covid-19 cases without a sufficient number of tests."

Smithfield Foods blamed "living circumstances in certain cultures" for its cluster. "Was there any way to prevent the Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in South Dakota from becoming one of the country's largest known coronavirus clusters, with more than 700 workers infected? It's hard to know 'what could have been done differently,' a Smithfield spokesperson said, given what she referred to as the plant's 'large immigrant population,'" BuzzFeed News reports. "'Living circumstances in certain cultures are different than they are with your traditional American family,' she explained . … But internal company communications and interviews with nearly a dozen workers and their relatives point to a series of management missteps and half measures that contributed significantly to the spread of the virus . … The company did little to inform or protect employees during the critical two weeks after the first case at the plant surfaced. … As more people called in sick, Smithfield management stayed mostly silent about the severity of the crisis at the Sioux Falls facility, only informing employees about a confirmed case if they'd recently been 'in contact' with the person … while encouraging others in company text messages to 'Please report to work as previously scheduled.'" 
About a quarter of Americans live in multifamily buildings, making isolation often impossible and creating tensions. New containment rules – or the lack of them – have left many residents angry or afraid, including New Yorkers living in a co-op who barred a doctor staying at his brother's place while treating patients with covid-19, or residents of a Washington condo who gave their neighbor pads for her dog to pee on so she wouldn't go outside and infect them.

The virus has devastated Detroit's police force. "The head of the homicide department died. So did a 911 operator and a volunteer police chaplain. As recently as Thursday, nine people from the department remained hospitalized, fighting to survive," the Times reports. "Out of about 2,800 uniformed officers and civilians who work for the department, at least 180 had tested positive for the virus by late last week, with more than 1,000 quarantined at some point. … Chief James Craig, a Detroit native, tested positive on March 27 and stayed isolated at home until Thursday. … 'I have to come into work concerned about whether I'm going to be the next victim or not,' said Officer Marc Perez, fresh out of the police academy."

Facebook cracked down on anti-quarantine rallies, barring protesters from organizing them. The decision led to blowback from conservative lawmakers and civil libertarians, who say it sets a dangerous precedent of clamping down on free speech. (Antonia Farzan)
Hospitals are tiptoeing toward restarting non-emergency surgery and procedures. "Some hospitals in communities less affected by the novel coronavirus moved cautiously Monday toward resuming non-emergency surgeries and procedures — a hopeful sign for patients awaiting that care and a medical system badly in need of the revenue those services provide," Frances Stead Sellers, Amy Goldstein and Lenny Bernstein report. "Acting on guidance released Sunday night by federal officials, medical centers with relatively few covid-19 patients readied some cancer, heart and other care that has been postponed."
South Korea says there are no signs Kim Jong Un is in grave danger. South Korea's government said there are no signs of unusual activity within North Korea that would suggest there is truth to CNN's reporting that U.S. intelligence officials believe Kim Jong Un is in "grave danger" after surgery. "Kim's health has long been a concern due to his smoking and obesity," Simon Denyer and Min Joo Kim report. "There has been speculation the 36-year-old dictator might have suffered some kind of illness after he failed to attend celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang last Wednesday, but information about his health is extremely hard to verify in the secretive state. 
"South Korean news website Daily NK reported late on Monday that Kim … had left for the hospital after presiding over a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's politburo on April 11. Kim has not been seen in public since then. On April 12, Pyongyang fired several short-range missiles. That's an event Kim might normally have attended, but the test was not reported on state media. On April 15, he was not seen at unusually low-key celebrations to mark Kim Il Sung's official birthday. At the time, experts said that could be because the regime wanted to avoid a huge crowd gathering during a coronavirus pandemic, or even because he was sending a signal about downplaying his grandfather's legacy. … At the very least, the reports are a reminder of the risks of instability if Kim were to die. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, represented her brother at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, and is thought to be a key confidant of her brother. Last month she issued her first political statements in her own name."
The price of oil dropping below $0 per barrel was a short-term anomaly. "It had to do with a specific supply of oil – West Texas Intermediate – and was tied up with the closing of the contract period for May delivery of oil at a time when no one needs any more petroleum," Will Englund reports. "The June delivery price for oil was up slightly Monday, to just over $20. … Yet … it is still down about 65 percent this year, and over time it would devastate North American shale and sand tar companies. … Major oil companies have cut back spending on new wells by 30 percent to 50 percent, and oilfield service companies have been laying off more and more workers. Some companies have started to shut in their wells, taking a serious hit to their finances. … Demand is now an estimated 25 to 30 percent below what it was. But oil-producing nations kept pumping through March and into early April, as the Saudis and Russians tried to bluff each other into cutting production, and at this point storage capacity has neared the brink. … 
"On April 12 both sides, together with the other main members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, agreed to cut production by a purported 10 million barrels a day, or about 10 percent of global output. But that still is less than the decline in consumption, and stocks have kept growing. The OPEC-Russia agreement was hailed by President Trump as a victory that would right the price of oil and save American oil-related jobs. It has done neither. North Dakota is a major oil producing state, sitting atop the Bakken shale formation, but the break-even price there is as much as $45 per barrel. … Canadian oil companies, which were not parties to the OPEC-Russia agreement, have started to shut in the wells in the sand-tar regions of Alberta. There, too, oil was trading in negative amounts Monday. … Nothing like this happened in the worst of the Depression, or in the early years of the Civil War, the two previous low points for petroleum…"
Israeli leaders formed a unity government, allowing Benjamin Netanyahu to remain prime minster. "Israel's rival political leaders broke the country's unprecedented political impasse Monday when [Netanyahu] and challenger Benny Gantz announced a deal to join forces and form an emergency unity government," Steve Hendrix and Ruth Eglash report. "Under the terms of the agreement, Netanyahu would remain prime minister for the next 18 months with Gantz then succeeding him. The agreement, following weeks of tense negotiations and brinkmanship, comes as Israel confronts a burgeoning outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Gantz, who had spent a year battling to unseat the prime minister, cited the public health crisis for his willingness to serve with Netanyahu, whom he had repeatedly called 'unfit to lead.' … Critics have bemoaned and observers marveled that Israel's longest-serving prime minister has once again outrun the political obituaries written for him after his party and its allies failed to regain their majority in three straight national elections and he was indicted on corruption charges along the way."
Female world leaders have won recognition as voices of reason amid the pandemic. Leaders from New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern to Silveria Jacobs, the prime minister of the Caribbean nation of Sint Maarten, have been successful in controlling the spread while also maintaining calm, Jennifer Hassan and Siobhán O'Grady report.

Full text: You may notice some changes to your newsletter today, including a new look and new name. It’s a preview of some changes we’re considering, and we’d love to get your feedback in this survey .
Good morning. Antibody tests are not going well. Conservatives are rallying against lockdowns. And Congress is close to a deal on small-business funding. But let’s start with an update on the coronavirus, and what’s likely to come next .
As the country starts yet another week on lockdown, we want to help you understand where things stand with the coronavirus — and what the near future may look like.
We’ll start with the good news. The aggressive social distancing of the past month is working. The much-discussed “flattening of the curve” is happening. The daily growth in confirmed American cases appears to have peaked more than a week ago:
This flattening of the curve is a necessary step for containing the virus, but it’s not enough. The United States remains months away from being able to return to normalcy. To put it another way, if we resume normal activities anytime soon, we’re almost guaranteed to spark new outbreaks that overwhelm the medical system and put us right back where we were a month ago.
That’s the main conclusion of a story by Donald McNeil, a Times reporter who’s been writing about infectious diseases for nearly two decades. Donald interviewed more than 20 public health experts and asked them about the next year. Here are the other key points:

- There is enormous uncertainty. In the best case, scientists would develop a vaccine or — more likely — treatments that mitigate the virus’s effects. It’s also possible that the virus will mutate to become much less severe over time. These happy outcomes are possible but, unfortunately, not the most likely scenario.

- Social distancing is still vital. The number of new cases has stabilized around 30,000 per day, but it hasn’t fallen significantly. And something like 300 million Americans have probably still not been exposed to the virus. The strategies of the past month are beginning to work, but only beginning.

- It’s not clear how well the United States will cope with the next phase. Reopening the economy without setting off new outbreaks will require discipline, public health experts say. It will depend on a big increase in testing capacity, as well as “contact tracing” — in which teams of medical workers track down people who have recently been exposed — and quarantining.



As Donald writes: “If we scrupulously protect ourselves and our loved ones, more of us will live. If we underestimate the virus, it will find us.”
THE MORNING FIVE
1. Failing on testing, again
A painful recent history may be repeating itself: Experts warn that the rollout of antibody tests is not going well. Those tests tell people if they’ve developed immunity to the coronavirus, probably because they’ve already had it. But recent evidence suggests that antibody tests may be just as flawed as the shoddy diagnostic tests used earlier this year.
Some tests are only about 20 percent accurate, The Times reports; others are likely to produce as many false positives as true ones. There are more than 90 versions of the test on the market, most of them made in China.
Read more: The Washington Post reported that the original testing failure sprang from “a glaring scientific breakdown” in which U.S. government scientists allowed test components to become contaminated.
2. Conservatives rally against lockdowns
At a “You Can’t Close America” rally in Austin, Texas, on Saturday, Alex Jones, the founder of the website Infowars, denounced the coronavirus pandemic as both a hoax and a “Chi-Comm globalist bioweapons attack”(a reference to the Chinese Communist Party). The event — described by our colleague Manny Fernandez as a modest gathering of a few dozen people — came after similar protests in Maryland, Michigan, Nevada and elsewhere.
3. Congress nears a deal on small business aid
The White House and congressional Democrats said they were close to an agreement on a $450 billion bill to respond to the virus. The measure would provide more aid for small businesses after an emergency relief fund ran out of money last week, along with more money for hospitals and expanded coronavirus testing.
4. Neiman Marcus may declare bankruptcy
The department store chain is preparing to seek protection from its creditors as soon as this week, Reuters reports. Neiman Marcus recently closed all of its stores and furloughed most of its 14,000 workers, amid an unprecedented decline in retail spending.
5. What will happen to cities?
The country’s three largest metropolitan areas — New York, Los Angeles and Chicago — have all lost population in the recent years, and growth in many other big metro areas has slowed. Now the virus has created a whole new set of reasons for people to question urban living. “If there was ever a moment where living in a major city becomes too much, it’s this moment,” said Aaron Bolzle, who runs a program in Tulsa, Okla., that offers $10,000 to people who relocate there.
Sabrina Tavernise and Sarah Mervosh offer the full report on what could happen to America’s big cities.
HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING

- A gunman killed at least 16 people in a shooting rampage in a rural community in Nova Scotia, Canada.

- Tokyo seems to have been “seduced by magical thinking,” with many people ignoring social distancing rules, our Tokyo bureau chief, Motoko Rich, writes.

- President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil cheered an anti-quarantine protest that called for a return to military rule.



BACK STORY
The Times has introduced a section — At Home — to offer advice to readers in lockdown. We spoke with Sam Sifton, our longtime Food editor who recently began overseeing culture and lifestyle coverage, about how the suggestions can help keep us all sane.
How did the new section start?
The cancellations of cultural events and the closing of restaurants and museums and movie theaters have fundamentally altered how our readers live their lives. So how are we going to assist them in living full and cultured lives despite that fact? At Home arose out of that discussion.
How has our culture and lifestyle coverage changed since the pandemic began?
We used to send reporters and critics out into the world to observe people doing things — onstage, in restaurants, in galleries. Now, it’s different. We offer guides to substituting ingredients. We show readers how to travel virtually, and how to cut their hair at home.
Is it trivializing our coverage to say we need distractions right now?
No, it’s the opposite. The work that our culture and lifestyle reporters are doing right now is central to the mission of The New York Times. We help people understand the world. And the world is filled with art and beauty and deliciousness, even amid a national emergency. Our thirst for the joy that those things bring to people remains. We’re here to slake it.
Play, Watch, Eat, Read
Commiserate with the class of 2020
The Times spent some time with 10 seniors from Omaha who feel like high school is ending on a whimper. “There’s been so many tears, but I guess the best thing that’s helped me get through it is that I’m not alone,” said Olivia Mathews, 17, above. “Every senior in high school in the world right now knows how I feel, so that makes the pain a little easier to deal with.”
Cook
Here are all of our best recipes and tips for cooking under quarantine. If you can get a pork shoulder in the market or defrost one from the freezer, Melissa Clark’s porchetta-style roast is a fine meal, with leftovers for sandwiches. Or make Sanjeev Kapoor’s lalla mussa dal for a vegetarian alternative. (Don’t have fenugreek? Substitute a teaspoon of mustard and a wee drizzle of honey.)
Check out Banksy at home
What happens when a famous street artist attempts to practice social distancing? Banksy unveiled a mural featuring several rats, inside what appears to be his bathroom.
Save some time for “The Last Dance”
ESPN’s documentary mini-series about Michael Jordan and the 1997-98 Chicago Bulls is an “ocean of archival game clips, dunk montages, smack talk, mea culpas, cigar smoking, backstabbing, frontstabbing, manfully restrained tears” and more, writes Wesley Morris, The Times’s critic-at-large. The first two installments premiered last night.
Rethink self-isolating at sea
Maybe escaping the pandemic on a superyacht isn’t such a good idea. People living full time on boats are facing social media shaming and new restrictions in port. Then there’s the issue of how to handle remote learning for the kids — one family, renting “quite a sizable yacht,” is adding cooking lessons from their chef to their home schooling curriculum.
Watch

- Rube Goldberg machines may be the answer to social distancing (and passing the pepper at the dinner table).

- Is there a better film for our current moment than “Groundhog Day”? Our film critics Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott are holding a virtual viewing party.

- Philly has found its answer to pizza rat: Behold, pizza groundhog.

The Daily 202: Coronavirus keeps Joe Biden a bystander, even as Bernie Sanders endorses him

Full text: The Democratic presidential nominating contest did not end with a brokered convention in Milwaukee. Instead, the denouement involved a friendly invitation to play a game of chess.
Bernie Sanders, from his house in Vermont, offered a full-throated endorsement of Joe Biden, sitting in his Delaware basement, during a Monday afternoon live stream. After a half-hour colloquy in which they emphasized areas of agreement and presented a unified front, the independent senator jokingly suggested that they play a game of chess for the reporters who had tuned in to watch what they were told would be the former vice president laying out his economic agenda to respond to the recession caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
"I've been playing on my cellphone," Biden said. "I've got a beautiful chessboard upstairs, and I haven't got anybody to play with."
Sanders had a chessboard sitting on the table behind him. "We'll bore everybody for a few hours," he told Biden.
It was a warm, light-hearted moment, and a marked contrast to the somewhat awkward New Hampshire rally during which Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton in July 2016 after more than a month of negotiations following the California primary. 
It was also immediately overshadowed by President Trump's off-the-rails coronavirus briefing at the White House, which lasted two hours and 24 minutes. "When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total," he declared. With 23,604 deaths in the United States from the coronavirus and 581,000 confirmed cases, the president also falsely claimed that Biden – whom he called "Sleepy Joe" – apologized for calling him xenophobic.
Biden has been struggling to break through amid the pandemic, when Trump's bully pulpit is bigger than ever. Former president Barack Obama reportedly plans to endorse Biden later today. But Monday captured in miniature his continuing challenges.
Trump's reelection committees announced that they raised $212 million in the first three months of the year, meaning that they've now brought in more than $1 billion to support his 2020 bid and have $240 million cash on hand. Biden raised $33 million during the first two weeks of March and $18 million in February, his campaign has said. All told, he's raised about $121 million for the campaign but depleted most of that to win the primaries. He has still not created a joint fundraising operation with the Democratic National Committee. 
And social distancing makes it harder to build up a traditional finance operation. Postponing the national convention will also delay by a month when he can access the pool of money for the general election.
Doug Sosnik, who served as Bill Clinton's White House political director, predicts that Biden will remain a bystander until sometime in May or early June, when the country shifts from facing "a health crisis with unimaginable economic consequences" to "a devastating economic crisis with continued health consequences."
" During the lockdown, Trump's organizational advantages will continue to expand – and so will his war chest – without ever leaving the White House ," Sosnik said. "Meanwhile, the lockdown has imposed significant obstacles for Biden's campaign, further complicating his efforts to begin building a robust general election political operation."
To be sure, there are certain advantages for Biden of a front-porch campaign. And the more this election is a pure referendum on Trump's leadership, the better that could be for Biden. The economy had been Trump's biggest strength until this crisis. The president lashed out at the media on Monday partly because he's on the defensive over revelations about the litany of early warning signs he failed to heed.
Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin could determine the election. Sosnik believes those six states will be decisive. "The electoral college math required to win the presidential race hasn't changed," he said. "While the pandemic has turned the world upside down in the last 30 days, some underlying dynamics of the race that were in play prior to the crisis have remained constant. Trump has been consistent about his singular goal of appealing to and maintaining his political base. … At the same time Trump has effectively appealed to his supporters, he has also solidified the anti-Trump vote in the process, making this a truly base election."
In a base election, which side turns out in greater numbers is obviously everything. "The debate as to whether states should expand voting options will be the single biggest fight that Republicans and Democrats will have in the run-up to the November election," Sosnik predicted. "In an election that will come down to six states, the health and economic consequences of the coronavirus in each of these states, as well as voter turnout, will determine who [wins]."
In a promising sign for Democrats on that front, a liberal challenger defeated the conservative incumbent for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court in last Tuesday's primary. Ballots were finally tabulated yesterday. "Jill Karofsky beat Daniel Kelly, whom then-Gov. Scott Walker (R) appointed to the state's high court in 2016. Trump endorsed Kelly and on Election Day urged Wisconsin voters 'to get out and vote NOW' for the justice," Amy Gardner and Dave Weigel report. "The contest prompted a rancorous partisan debate over whether to proceed with in-person voting April 7, which Democrats opposed and Republicans supported. It was also hard-fought because of potential implications in the November presidential election, with a judicial decision about whether to purge the state's voter rolls hanging in the partisan balance of the court."
In other potentially significant presidential campaign news, Michigan Rep. Justin Amash said Monday that he's looking "closely" at a third-party bid, which could divert votes from Trump. Amash, who quit the Republican Party last July 4 to become an independent after endorsing the president's impeachment, tweeted that "Americans who believe in limited government deserve another option." The Libertarian Party is planning to nominate a candidate for president at its convention in Austin on May 25. So far, no well-known figure has entered the race.
Sanders said he is "not going to paper over" his differences with his ex-rival.  But the senator said Trump must be defeated. "We need you in the White House," Sanders told Biden during their joint appearance. "I will do all that I can to see that that happens, Joe."
In turn, Biden promised Sanders that he would govern as "one of the most progressive" presidents since Franklin Roosevelt. He also announced that he has agreed to include former Sanders supporters on six new policy working groups he's creating to offer proposals and "creative new ideas" on the economy, education, climate change, criminal justice, immigration and health care. Biden also said he also wants to create a new Cabinet-level position on pandemics.
"We're apart on some issues, but we're awfully close on a whole bunch of others," Biden told Sanders. "And you don't get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror and ask ourselves: Have we done enough? And we haven't."
Governors are forming blocs to explore lifting restrictions. "Trump declared Monday that he has 'total' authority and 'calls the shots' when it comes to deciding how and when to lift the pandemic restrictions and reopen the economy, even as governors on both coasts proceeded with their own plans and asserted their own powers," Tim Craig and Brady Dennis report. "New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo [D] called in to CNN and suggested Trump was acting like 'a king.' … Cuomo said he would challenge the White House in court if Trump pushes to reopen businesses without enough safeguards to protect public health. Earlier in the day, Cuomo was joined via phone by governors from New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Rhode Island as they formed a pact to coordinate on an eventual end to their states' restrictions. Later, Cuomo announced that Massachusetts, led by Gov. Charlie Baker (R), was joining the group. … On the West Coast, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington also announced a pact to work together to tamp down the ongoing outbreak and carefully restart the economy in their states.
"Underlining the sharp political and cultural divide that has undergirded the nation's reaction to the pandemic, nine of the 10 governors involved in the two groups are Democrats. … The White House is assembling its own internal task force on how to do so. … Governors typically have authority to lift the stay-at-home restrictions and business closures in their states. But if Trump calls for the economy to reopen, many ordinary Americans, as well as some GOP governors, may heed his exhortations."

While Trump picks a fight with governors, corporate America is making its own plans. "While many question the timing, everyone from small manufacturers to major brands such as Whirlpool … are taking steps to get their workers back on the job. Mostly that involves testing on a scale that is, for now, out of reach," Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin report. "Two types of tests are in demand. One is a diagnostic test to determine whether a person has covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Another, still being developed, is designed to tell if one has developed immunity to the virus. Both will be needed to ease the current U.S. lockdown. … One issue when all employees return: whether to use infrared cameras to detect elevated body temperatures, which would be faster than using individual thermometers. Temperature checks still wouldn't flag workers who are carrying the virus and contagious but show no symptoms."
The CIA warned employees against using the anti-malaria drug touted by Trump.  "The CIA has privately advised its workforce that taking an anti-malarial drug touted by President Trump and some of his supporters as a promising treatment for the novel coronavirus has potentially dangerous side effects, including sudden death," Devlin Barrett reports. "The warning, featured on a website for CIA employees with questions related to the spread of covid-19, came in late March after public discussion — and promotion by the president — that hydroxychloroquine, administered in concert with the antibiotic azithromycin, might prove effective against the disease."
The novel coronavirus killed a sailor assigned to the USS Theodore Roosevelt.  This is the first death of an active-duty service member caused by the virus, as confirmed cases among the crew climbed to at least 585. "The sailor, who was not immediately identified, had been moved to an intensive care unit last week after being found unresponsive Thursday at Naval Base Guam. The sailor tested positive for the virus March 30 and was placed in isolation," Dan Lamothe reports. "Navy Capt. Brett Crozier, the ship's commanding officer, was removed from his job after sending a memo to senior Navy officials late last month that sounded an alarm about how slowly the service was responding to the outbreak. … As of Monday, more than half of the entire military's 929 positive cases of the coronavirus are members of the Theodore Roosevelt crew."
The Navy is battling a growing outbreak among the crew of the hospital ship Mercy, where seven have tested positive for the virus. The outbreak hasn't affected the vessel's ability to receive patients. It remains docked off the coast of Los Angeles. (Los Angeles Times)
The USS Harry S. Truman, a carrier in the Atlantic fleet that has been deployed to the Middle East since November, will remain at sea to avoid bringing the virus onboard. Rear Adm. Andrew Loiselle, commander of the carrier strike group, said he's certain there are no coronavirus cases among the ship's 5,000 sailors. (Teo Armus)
The Air Force debuted an isolation system to evacuate U.S. contractors from Afghanistan. First developed during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, these containment units allow patients to be treated in-flight while minimizing risks to the crew and caregivers. (Teo Armus)
Trump will probably announce restrictions on U.S. funding for the World Health Organization.  The restrictions come as "the administration and conservative allies have ramped up their criticism that the United Nations agency catered to China early in the outbreak and jeopardized global health," Anne Gearan reports. "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other U.S. officials are expected to recommend to Trump ways to dock or condition payments to the agency as Republicans in Congress seek documentation of WHO dealings with China, said people familiar with White House and State Department discussions."

The administration asked Congress to push back census deadlines by months. "Under the new plan, the Census Bureau would reactivate field offices in June and extend the window for data collection from mid-August to Oct. 31. It would also extend by four months the deadline for delivering apportionment counts to the president to April 30, 2021, and the deadline for delivering redistricting data to states to July 31, 2021," Tara Bahrampour reports. "Pushing back the reporting deadlines would require Congress to pass legislation the president must sign. But the request comes at a time of heightened tension between the administration and the House Oversight Committee."

In his first interview since recovering from covid-19, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) told Fox News that he "never had a headache, never had a body ache, never had a fever, never had a cough."
Trump's testing promises remain largely unfulfilled.  Rather than a sweeping national campaign of screening, drive-through sample collection and lab testing, NPR reporters found a smattering of small pilot projects and aborted efforts. "In some cases, no action was taken at all. Target did not formally partner with the federal government, for example. And a lauded Google project turned out not to be led by Google at all, and then once launched was limited to a smattering of counties in California. … [Discussions with large retailers] have not led to any wide-scale implementation of drive-through tests. … The president also welcomed Bruce Greenstein, an executive vice president of the LHC Group, to the microphone. Greenstein's organization primarily provides in-home health care, and he pledged that it would be helping with testing … NPR called more than 20 LHC sites in 12 states, and none of them is doing in-home testing."

Trump said he will not fire Tony Fauci. "The White House sought to tamp down speculation Monday that Trump would fire the nation's top epidemiologist in the middle of the pandemic, but concern over an Easter presidential retweet attacking Fauci continued to reverberate as many of the president's allies and critics warned that such a move would be counterproductive," Toluse Olorunnipa, Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey report. "Several administration officials, top lawmakers and public health experts expressed concern that Fauci could be sidelined or silenced in the critical days ahead as Trump makes decisions about whether to encourage Americans to return to normal economic and social activities. On Monday, Trump dismissed those concerns as if he had not initially sparked them when he retweeted a message Sunday night that included the hashtag #FireFauci. … At the news briefing, Fauci appeared to back away from some of the comments … that had drawn Trump's scorn — describing his Sunday remarks to CNN as 'a poor choice of words.' He was asked whether this was being done under pressure. 'Everything I do is voluntarily,' Fauci said as Trump looked on. … 
"Fauci, who has been the nation's top infectious-diseases official since 1984, is not a political appointee and is shielded by several layers of federal civil servant protections. He can't be removed without cause and his dismissal would be subject to due process procedures. But Fauci could be reassigned within the National Institutes of Health, officials said, or essentially pushed aside within the White House coronavirus task force and see his influence diminished."
"I think controversy's a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump said during the news conference, addressing Fauci's fate.
South Dakota's governor refused to issue a stay-at-home order. Now her state is a hot spot.  "Edicts to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, Gov. Kristi L. Noem said disparagingly, reflected a 'herd mentality.' It was up to individuals — not government — to decide whether 'to exercise their right to work, to worship and to play. Or to even stay at home,'" Griff Witte reports. "And besides, the first-term Republican told reporters at a briefing this month, 'South Dakota is not New York City.' But now South Dakota is home to one of the largest single coronavirus clusters anywhere in the United States, with more than 300 workers at a giant ­pork-processing plant falling ill. With the case numbers continuing to spike, the company was forced to announce the indefinite closure of the facility Sunday, threatening the U.S. food supply. Increasingly exasperated local leaders, public health experts and front-line medical workers begged Noem to intervene Monday with a more aggressive state response. … But the governor continued to resist. Instead, she used a media briefing Monday to announce trials of [hydroxychloroquine]. … 'It's an exciting day,' she boasted, repeatedly citing her conversations with [Jared Kushner]."
South Dakota's experience shows no part of the country is immune to being ravaged by this virus. Noem is one of five Republican governors representing relatively rural states — North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Arkansas are the others — still refusing the pleas of public health professionals.
"A shelter-in-place order is needed now. It is needed today," said Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken, whose city is at the center of South Dakota's outbreak and who has had to improvise with voluntary recommendations in the absence of statewide action that would allow enforcement. Reopening the country by May is "not even remotely achievable," said TenHaken, a Republican. "We're in the early innings of this thing in Sioux Falls."
A Virginia pastor who defiantly held church services died from the virus.  "In his last known in-person service on March 22, Bishop Gerald O. Glenn got his congregation at Richmond's New Deliverance Evangelistic Church to stand to prove how many were there despite warnings against gatherings of more than 10 people. 'I firmly believe that God is larger than this dreaded virus. You can quote me on that,' he said, repeating it a second time to claps, saying that 'people are healed' in his church," the New York Post reports. "'I am essential,' he said of remaining open, adding, 'I'm a preacher — I talk to God!' On Sunday, his church announced 'with an exceedingly sorrowful and heavy heart' that the pastor had died a week after being diagnosed with COVID-19."

New York's Little Italy relives the heartache felt as relatives died in Italy. "'Papa Joe' Migliucci was the fourth-generation owner of Mario's, a 101-year-old red-sauce restaurant on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. Moe Albanese was known affectionately throughout Manhattan's Little Italy as 'Moe the Butcher.' Both men — ages 81 and 95, respectively — were among the more than 2,000 New Yorkers who died citywide last week from the coronavirus pandemic. Statistically speaking, their deaths are insignificant. But try telling that to the city's tightly knit Italian American community," Richard Morgan reports. "As New York state's confirmed covid-19 infections have now surpassed those in all of Italy (or any other foreign country) and the U.S. death toll now outnumbers that of Italy, Europe's epicenter, Italian-Americans here described their lives and their identities as imploding on both ends of their hyphen. … Cuomo [the governor and the grandson of an Italian immigrant] informed New Yorkers on Monday that while the 'worst is over,' life here won't fully return to normal for another 12 to 18 months, when there is likely to be a vaccine against the coronavirus."

Some communities hit by tornadoes were already suffering from virus outbreaks.  "Communities across the South on Monday began the grueling work of cleaning up the wreckage left behind by a string of deadly tornadoes, tasks made more treacherous by the threat of the coronavirus pandemic. The storms began sweeping through the region on Easter Sunday, killing at least 30 people and knocking out power to more than a million homes," David Montgomery, Richard Webster, Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Frances Stead Sellers report. "In almost all of the hardest-hit communities, covid-19 … has forced people to isolate indoors, packed hospitals and stressed the emergency workers who are the first to respond to a natural disaster. The overlapping crises have made responding to both a dangerous gambit, now and in the months to come. How do you get people to shelter-in-place when hundreds of homes are damaged or destroyed? 'This is like a double whammy for our community,' said Clarksdale, Miss., Mayor Chuck Espy on Monday, as he toured the 47 homes that had been damaged in his city of 17,000. 'It's already a trying time for everybody. If we don't have any additional coronavirus fatalities, I think we'd have to count our blessings this week.' He hoped the state would declare another state of emergency for his city."
Patients are in pain, and dentists are in distress. "Easter Brown opened her mouth as wide as she could as a dentist yanked out the seven teeth she had left. At 77 years old, she was finally going to get a full set of dentures. She went home toothless that day in February and waited for the call saying her new smile had arrived. But when her phone rang in March, Brown was told that her dental clinic in the District was almost completely shutting down," Jessica Contrera reports. "The risk of dentists and patients spreading the novel coronavirus was just too high. They promised Brown would get her dentures when the clinic reopened. They just weren't sure when that would be. Ever since, Brown — already at a higher risk because of age and asthma, already enduring a newly isolated life — has been talking and chewing with only her gums. Her pain is shared by dental patients across the country." The American Dental Association has recommended that all practices close for everything except emergencies, but it's not clear what constitutes an emergency.

As their co-workers die, Michigan's transit workers say they're being unfairly put at risk. "Most mayors have deemed transit workers essential to the continued health and safety of their cities. This was especially true in Detroit, where about 25 percent of residents depend solely on public buses," Greg Jaffe and Annie Gowen report. "As of Friday, 51 bus system employees had tested positive for the coronavirus and 136 were in quarantine, city officials said. The rest have kept on working, including [Eric] Colts, who made it home around 4 a.m. that morning after [his best friend and colleague Jason] Hargrove died. He showered and tried to get some sleep, but his mind was racing. The public had rallied to the support of doctors, nurses, policemen and paramedics, but Colts felt he and his fellow bus drivers had been forgotten as the number of deaths from covid-19 in southeastern Michigan soared … 'He had the gloves; he had the mask. He did the hand sanitizer, the hand-washing,' Colts said. 'He did it all. The only thing me and him did not do, and the rest of my co-workers is not doing, is to stay in the house. Because we have to get the f--- up every day and move this f---ing city.'"

Experts fear school closures will severely stunt the learning of millions of kids.  "In Miami, school will extend into the summer and start earlier in the fall, at least for some students. In Cleveland, schools may shrink the curriculum to cover only core subjects. In Columbia, Mo., this year's lessons will be woven into next year's. Some experts suggest holding back more kids, a controversial idea, while others propose a half-grade step-up for some students, an unconventional one. A national teachers union is proposing a massive national summer school program," Laura Meckler, Valerie Strauss and Joe Heim report. "The ideas being considered will require political will and logistical savvy, and they are already facing resistance from teachers and parents. They'll also require money, and lots of it … Seventeen states have ordered campuses shuttered through this academic year, another three recommend it, and educators and parents across the country are bracing for a lost spring — and maybe more. …
"Whenever schools return, researchers say, the likely result is a generation of students forced to play catch-up, perhaps for years to come. In some districts, the problem is just getting kids to show up. In the Los Angeles Unified School District, the country's second-largest system, 1 in 4 students have not logged on at all. … Only about 1 in 4 students in the high-poverty Baltimore City Public Schools had computers. … In Atlanta's public schools, about 6,000 children still don't have computers, and about 10 percent of students have not yet logged in to the remote-learning system … In Philadelphia's public schools, teachers have been told not to teach new material because of concerns that lessons cannot be equitably provided to all."

The number of confirmed infections in the D.C. region is 16,661 this morning.  "The number of virus-related deaths was 263 in Maryland, 149 in Virginia and 53 in the District, for a total of 465 fatalities," Dana Hedgpeth reports. "A group of scientists advising Virginia's government said Monday that social distancing in the state appears to be working, and their models show the state's hospitals have enough beds to handle the novel coronavirus pandemic for the next few months if current trends continue. D.C. officials said Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) will decide this week whether to extend school and business closures beyond the current end date of April 24, and Maryland Gov.

Full text: A decade of health disinformation promoted by President Vladimir Putin of Russia has sown wide confusion, hurt major institutions and encouraged the spread of deadly illnesses.
On Feb. 3, soon after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus to be a global health emergency, an obscure Twitter account in Moscow began retweeting an American blog. It said the pathogen was a germ weapon designed to incapacitate and kill. The headline called the evidence "irrefutable" even though top scientists had already debunked that claim and declared the novel virus to be natural.
As the pandemic has swept the globe, it has been accompanied by a dangerous surge of false information -- an "infodemic," according to the World Health Organization. Analysts say that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has played a principal role in the spread of false information as part of his wider effort to discredit the West and destroy his enemies from within.
The House, the Senate and the nation's intelligence agencies have typically focused on election meddling in their examinations of Mr. Putin's long campaign. But the repercussions are wider. An investigation by The New York Times -- involving scores of interviews as well as a review of scholarly papers, news reports, and Russian documents, tweets and TV shows -- found that Mr. Putin has spread misinformation on issues of personal health for more than a decade.
His agents have repeatedly planted and spread the idea that viral epidemics -- including flu outbreaks, Ebola and now the coronavirus -- were sown by American scientists. The disinformers have also sought to undermine faith in the safety of vaccines, a triumph of public health that Mr. Putin himself promotes at home.
Moscow's aim, experts say, is to portray American officials as downplaying the health alarms and thus posing serious threats to public safety.
"It's all about seeding lack of trust in government institutions," Peter Pomerantsev, author of "Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible," a 2014 book on Kremlin disinformation, said in an interview.
The Russian president has waged his long campaign by means of open media, secretive trolls and shadowy blogs that regularly cast American health officials as patronizing frauds. Of late, new stealth and sophistication have made his handiwork harder to see, track and fight.
Even so, the State Department recently accused Russia of using thousands of social media accounts to spread coronavirus misinformation -- including a conspiracy theory that the United States engineered the deadly pandemic.
The Kremlin's audience for open disinformation is surprisingly large. The YouTube videos of RT, Russia's global television network, average one million views per day, "the highest among news outlets," according to a U.S. intelligence report. Since the founding of the Russian network in 2005, its videos have received more than four billion views, analysts recently concluded.
Because public interest in wellness and longevity runs high, health disinformation can have a disproportionally large social impact. Experts fear that it will foster public cynicism that erodes Washington's influence as well as the core democratic value of relying on demonstrable facts as a basis for decision-making.
"The accumulation of these operations over a long period of time will result in a major political impact," Ladislav Bittman, a former Soviet bloc disinformation officer, said in explaining the Kremlin's long-game rationale.
Sandra C. Quinn, a professor of public health at the University of Maryland who has followed Mr. Putin's vaccine scares for more than a half-decade, said the Russian president was drawing on an old playbook. "The difference now is the speed with which it spreads, and the denigration of the institutions that we rely on to understand the truth," she said in an interview. "I think we're in dangerous territory."
Living weapons
As a young man, Mr. Putin served in the K.G.B., the Soviet Union's main intelligence agency, from 1975 to 1991. He worked in foreign intelligence, which required its officers to spend a quarter of their time conceiving and implementing plans for sowing disinformation. What Mr. Putin accomplished is unclear. But public accounts show that he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and that his 16-year tenure coincided with a major K.G.B. operation to deflect attention from Moscow's secret arsenal of biological weapons, which it built in contravention of a treaty signed with the United States in 1972.
The K.G.B. campaign -- which cast the deadly virus that causes AIDS as a racial weapon developed by the American military to kill black citizens -- was wildly successful. By 1987, fake news stories had run in 25 languages and 80 countries, undermining American diplomacy, especially in Africa. After the Cold War, in 1992, the Russians admitted that the alarms were fraudulent.
As Russia's president and prime minister, Mr. Putin has embraced and expanded the playbook, linking any natural outbreak to American duplicity. Attacking the American health system, and faith in it, became a hallmark of his rule.
At first, his main disseminator of fake news was Russia Today, which he founded in 2005 in Moscow; in 2008 it was renamed RT, obscuring its Russian origins.
Early in 2009, a particularly virulent flu, named H1N1, swept the globe, and thousands of people died. That year, the network featured the conspiratorial views of Wayne Madsen, a regular contributor in Washington whom it described as an investigative journalist. In at least nine shows and text bulletins, Mr. Madsen characterized the deadly germ as bioengineered. "The world is actually fighting a man-made tragedy," one bulletin declared.

That June, Mr. Madsen told RT viewers that the virus makers had worked at a shadowy mix of laboratories, including the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, in Frederick, Md. The institute's official job is to help defend the United States against the kinds of pathogens that Mr. Madsen accused it of creating.
In a follow-up show, Mr. Madsen said the virus had been spliced together from other flu strains, including the virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic, and likened its creators to the mad scientists of "Jurassic Park," the hit movie about resurrected dinosaurs. RT's chyron for the show characterized the result as "Germ Warfare."
In 2010, the network founded a new arm, RT America, a few blocks from the White House. Mr. Madsen became a regular on-camera guest.
In 2012 Mr. Putin added the military to his informational arsenal. His newly appointed head of the Russian Army, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, laid out a new doctrine of war that stressed public messaging as a means of stirring foreign dissent. That same year, a shadowy group of trolls in St. Petersburg began using Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to fire salvos of junk information at millions of Americans. The goals were to boost social polarization and damage the reputation of federal agencies.
A rich opportunity arose in 2014 when Ebola swept West Africa. It was the worst-ever outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever, eventually claiming more than 10,000 lives.
RT's gallery of alleged criminals once again included the U.S. Army. The network profiled an accusation by Cyril Broderick, a former plant pathologist, who claimed in a Liberian newspaper article that the outbreak was an American plot to turn Africans into bioweapon guinea pigs, and cited the AIDS accusation as supporting evidence.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The RT presenter noted that the United States was spending hundreds of millions of dollars to aid Ebola victims in Africa but added: "It can't buy back the world's trust."
The trolls in St. Petersburg amplified the claim on Twitter. The deadly virus "is government made," one tweet declared. Another series of tweets called the microorganism "just a regular bio weapon." The idea found an audience. The hip-hop artist Chris Brown echoed it in 2014, telling his 13 million Twitter followers, "I think this Ebola epidemic is a form of population control."
C.D.C. in the cross hairs
Mr. Putin's campaign of health misinformation was now a global enterprise, with the creative energy of a fun house and the ability to strike anywhere.
The next target was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States' flagship public health agency. In late 2014, a rash of fake news reports falsely claimed that an Ebola victim in Liberia had been flown to Atlanta, starting a local outbreak. A YouTube video showed what it described as C.D.C. personnel, in hazmat suits, receiving and moving the patient in secret. The deceptive video included a truck bearing the logo of the Atlanta airport.
A rush of tweets turned up the volume. "Panic here in ATL!!" one stated. Another exclaimed, "OMG! Ebola is everywhere!"
As the Kremlin grew more confident, it began to simply recycle old narratives rather than wait for new epidemics to emerge. In 2017, Russian trolls used Twitter to give the AIDS falsehood new life. This time the claimed perpetrator was Dr. Robert Gallo, a scientist who in 1984 had actually helped discover the virus that causes AIDS. The tweets quoted him, falsely, as saying he had designed the pathogen to depopulate humanity. The trolls cited a website, World Truth. Its video attacking Dr. Gallo registered nearly four million views.
Six researchers centered at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that, over decades, the false narratives around AIDS had fostered a "lack of trust" among African-Americans that kept many from seeking medical care. Their 2018 study, of hundreds of black men in Los Angeles who have sex with men, reported that nearly half the interviewees thought the virus responsible for AIDS had been manufactured. And more than one-fifth viewed people who take new protective drugs as "human guinea pigs for the government."
Beleaguered defenders
Within Russia, Mr. Putin has been a staunch proponent of vaccines.
"I make sure I get my vaccinations in time, before the flu season starts," he told listeners to a 2016 call-in show. At a televised meeting with doctors in St. Petersburg, in 2018, he scolded Russian parents who refuse to vaccinate their kids: "They endanger the lives of their own children."
Calling the issue "very important," he warned of possible administrative steps to speed the pace of childhood immunizations. Last fall, Russia's health authorities laid out expanded rules that require strict new adherence to protocols for childhood vaccination.
At the same time, Mr. Putin has worked hard to encourage Americans to see vaccinations as dangerous and federal health officials as malevolent. The threat of autism is a regular theme of this anti-vaccine campaign. The C.D.C. has repeatedly ruled out the possibility that vaccinations lead to autism, as have many scientists and top journals. Nonetheless the false narrative has proliferated, spread by Russian trolls and media.
Moreover, the disinformation has sought to implicate the C.D.C. in a cover-up. For years, tweets originating in St. Petersburg have claimed that the health agency muzzled a whistle-blower to hide evidence that vaccines cause autism, especially in male African-American infants. Medical experts have dismissed the allegation, but it reverberated.
In a series of 2015 tweets, Russian trolls promoted a video of a black minister in Los Angeles addressing a rally. "They're not just shooting us with guns," he told the audience. "They're killing us with needles." The minister and accompanying text in the video claimed that childhood immunizations had caused autism in 200,000 black children.
RT America echoed the charge. It focused on "Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe," a 2016 film by Andrew Wakefield, a discredited anti-vaccine activist. When the film was pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival after a public outcry, the network aired an interview with its creators. "Can we trust the C.D.C. on vaccines?" a plug for the show asked.
Russian trolls fired off tweets containing links to the film and a fund-raising site for its promotion. One claimed that autism rates were about to skyrocket to "1 in 2" vaccinated children.
Mr. Putin's disinformation blitz has coincided with a drop in vaccination rates among children in the United States and a rise in measles, a disease once considered vanquished. The virus, especially in infants and young children, can cause fevers and brain damage. Last year, according to the C.D.C., the United States had 1,282 new cases, a record in recent decades; of these, 128 involved hospitalizations and 61 resulted in major complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis.
The new threat
The Moscow site that retweeted the coronavirus blog in February belongs to a Russian news outlet called The Russophile. It is tauntingly bold. The author portrait on its Twitter page shows an unidentifiable soldier in green fatigues holding an orange tabby cat. The background image is a colorized Kremlin mosaic. The site calls itself a "news feed from free (= not owned by the globalist elite) media."
On the site's About page, under the heading "Some more reasons for our existence," is a quote attributed to President Abraham Lincoln: "You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time."
The website lists its owner's name as OOOKremlinTrolls and its street address as an imposing building next door to the offices of Lukoil, a Russian oil giant tied to Cambridge Analytica's digital campaigns to sway American voters. "It's a nice part of town," Darren L. Linvill, a Clemson University expert who uncovered the retweets, said of the Russophile address.
The site epitomizes the complicated nature of the new threat, parts of which have evolved to become more open, while others have grown stealthier. "It's a cloud of Russian influencers," said Dr. Linvill, a professor of communications who has studied millions of troll postings. The players, he said, probably include state actors, intelligence operatives, former RT staff members and the digital teams of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a secretive oligarch and confident of Mr. Putin's who financed the St. Petersburg troll farm.
The new brand of disinformation is subtler than the old. Dr. Linvill and his colleague Patrick L. Warren have argued that Mr. Putin's new methodology seeks less to create than to curate -- to retweet and amplify the existing American cacophony, raising the level of confusion and partisan discord.
Much of the disinformation, like the Russophile site, lies hidden in plain sight. But other elements embody a new sophistication that makes it increasingly hard for tech companies to ferret out the interference of Russia, or any other country. Experts say that Russian trolls may even be paying Americans to post disinformation on their behalf, to better hide their digital fingerprints.
On March 5, Lea Gabrielle, head of the State Department's Global Engagement Center, which seeks to identify and fight disinformation, told a Senate hearing that Moscow had pounced on the coronavirus outbreak as a new opportunity to sow chaos and division -- to "take advantage of a health crisis where people are terrified."
"The entire ecosystem of Russian disinformation has been engaged," she reported. Her center's analysts and partners, Ms. Gabrielle added, have found "Russian state proxy websites, official state media, as well as swarms of online false personas pushing out false narratives."
RT America dismissed the department's charges, which were first made in February, as "loosely detailed." In her March testimony, Ms. Gabrielle said that her center had intentionally made public few details and examples of the disinformation, so that adversaries could not decipher "our tradecraft," presumably in an effort to foil countermeasures.
Tass, the Russian news agency, reported that the Foreign Ministry firmly rejected the State Department's charge. That response echoes an iron rule of disinformation. As Oleg Kalugin, a former K.G.B. general, put it in a video interview with The Times: "Deny, deny, deny -- even if the truth is obvious."
Beijing now appears to be borrowing from Mr. Putin's playbook, at least the early drafts. It recently declared that the coronavirus was devised by Washington as a designer weapon meant to cripple China.
Mr. Putin has disseminated false and alarming health narratives not only about pathogens and vaccines but also about radio waves, bioengineered genes, industrial chemicals and other intangibles of modern life. The knotty topics often defy public understanding, making them ideal candidates for sowing confusion over what's safe and dangerous.
Analysts see an effort not only to undermine American officials but also to accomplish something more basic: to damage American science, a foundation of national prosperity. American researchers have won more than 100 Nobel Prizes since 2000, and Russians five. Geographically, Russia is the world's largest country, but its economy is smaller than Italy's.
As Dr. Quinn of the University of Maryland put it, Mr. Putin's salvos are targeting "the institutions that we rely on to understand the truth."

Full text: A decade of health disinformation promoted by President Vladimir Putin of Russia has sown wide confusion, hurt major institutions and encouraged the spread of deadly illnesses.
On Feb. 3, soon after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus to be a global health emergency, an obscure Twitter account in Moscow began retweeting an American blog. It said the pathogen was a germ weapon designed to incapacitate and kill. The headline called the evidence “irrefutable” even though top scientists had already debunked that claim and declared the novel virus to be natural.
As the pandemic has swept the globe, it has been accompanied by a dangerous surge of false information — an “infodemic,” according to the World Health Organization. Analysts say that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has played a principal role in the spread of false information as part of his wider effort to discredit the West and destroy his enemies from within.
The House, the Senate and the nation’s intelligence agencies have typically focused on election meddling in their examinations of Mr. Putin’s long campaign. But the repercussions are wider. An investigation by The New York Times — involving scores of interviews as well as a review of scholarly papers, news reports, and Russian documents, tweets and TV shows — found that Mr. Putin has spread misinformation on issues of personal health for more than a decade.
His agents have repeatedly planted and spread the idea that viral epidemics — including flu outbreaks, Ebola and now the coronavirus — were sown by American scientists. The disinformers have also sought to undermine faith in the safety of vaccines, a triumph of public health that Mr. Putin himself promotes at home.
Moscow’s aim, experts say, is to portray American officials as downplaying the health alarms and thus posing serious threats to public safety.
“It’s all about seeding lack of trust in government institutions,” Peter Pomerantsev, author of “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible,” a 2014 book on Kremlin disinformation, said in an interview.
The Russian president has waged his long campaign by means of open media, secretive trolls and shadowy blogs that regularly cast American health officials as patronizing frauds. Of late, new stealth and sophistication have made his handiwork harder to see, track and fight.
Even so, the State Department recently accused Russia of using thousands of social media accounts to spread coronavirus misinformation — including a conspiracy theory that the United States engineered the deadly pandemic.
The Kremlin’s audience for open disinformation is surprisingly large. The YouTube videos of RT, Russia’s global television network, average one million views per day, “the highest among news outlets,” according to a U.S. intelligence report. Since the founding of the Russian network in 2005, its videos have received more than four billion views, analysts recently concluded.

The knotty topics often defy public understanding, making them ideal candidates for sowing confusion over what’s safe and dangerous.
Analysts see an effort not only to undermine American officials but also to accomplish something more basic: to damage American science, a foundation of national prosperity. American researchers have won more than 100 Nobel Prizes since 2000, and Russians five. Geographically, Russia is the world’s largest country, but its economy is smaller than Italy’s.
As Dr. Quinn of the University of Maryland put it, Mr. Putin’s salvos are targeting “the institutions that we rely on to understand the truth.”

Full text: The coordinator of the coronavirus response emphasized that social distancing was still the most important step people could take. Critical medicines are running low, and nearly 10 million Americans have lost their jobs.
This briefing has ended. Read our global live coverage on the coronavirus pandemic here.
The C.D.C. is expected to advise all Americans to wear cloth masks in public. Trump says it won’t be mandatory.
The Trump administration appeared to be conflicted Thursday about whether to recommend that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public, even as federal health officials were revising guidance to reflect new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms.
Until now, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, like the World Health Organization, has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks, including N95 respirator masks, for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.
At a White House briefing Thursday evening, President Trump said his administration was “coming out with regulations” on mask wearing but stressed that the guidance would be entirely voluntary. “If people want to wear them, they can,” he said.
According to a federal official, the C.D.C. has been preparing to recommend that everyone wear face coverings in public settings, like pharmacies and grocery stores, to avoid unwittingly spreading the virus. Public health officials have continued to stress, however, that N95 masks and surgical masks should be saved for front-line doctors and nurses, who have been in dire need of protective gear.
For weeks, the administration has sent conflicting messages on masks. At first, officials clearly stated that masks should only be worn by sick people. For some time, Mr. Trump has been saying masks might be useful, but scarves would be fine as well. Chinese officials have expressed alarm at how few ordinary Americans are covering their noses and mouths.
Earlier this week, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., confirmed in a radio interview that the agency was reviewing its guidelines on who should wear masks. Citing new data that shows high rates of transmission from people who are infected but show no symptoms, he said the guidance on mask wearing was “being critically re-reviewed, to see if there’s potential additional value for individuals that are infected or individuals that may be asymptomatically infected.”
Birx says social distancing is the key to slowing the virus and pleads with Americans to follow government guidelines.
Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the virus response, pleaded with Americans on Thursday to follow the federal guidelines on social distancing “to a tee,” emphasizing that it was still the most important step Americans could take to slow the spread. Masks, she said, weren’t enough.
Failing to follow the guidelines would keep the United States on a steep trajectory of new cases and deaths.
“We have to change that slope; we have to change the logarithmic curve that we’re on,” she said of the steep increases in cases in many parts of the country. “We see country after country having done that, what it means in the United States is not everyone is doing it.”
Under prodding by Mr. Trump, Dr. Birx noted that some communities in the United States are doing a better job lowering the steep curve of cases by keeping people inside with social distancing.
She added: “We see Spain, we see Italy, we see France, we see Germany, when we see others beginning to bend their curves. We can bend ours, but it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as Americans.”
Dr. Birx said that recommendations against gatherings of more than 10 do not mean people should be having dinner parties or cocktail parties of less than 10 people.
“We’re only as strong as every community, every county, every state, every American following the guidelines to a tee,” she said. “And I can tell by the curve, and as it is today that not every American is following it. And so this is really a call to action.”
There are now more than 1 million coronavirus cases worldwide.
The coronavirus pandemic has sickened more than 1 million people, according to official counts, almost a quarter of them in the United States . As of Thursday afternoon, at least 51,000 people have died, and the virus has been detected in at least 171 countries, as these maps show. There is evidence on six continents of sustained transmission of the virus.
[Analysis: The coronavirus inflicts its own kind of terror .]
The New York Times is engaged in an effort to track the details of every confirmed case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials around the clock. The numbers in this article are being updated several times a day based on the latest information our journalists are gathering from around the country. The Times has made that data public in hopes of helping researchers and policymakers as they seek to slow the pandemic and prevent future ones.
In only two weeks, 10 million U.S. jobs have vanished.
When the first cases of the coronavirus were reported in the United States in January, President Trump mostly dismissed the looming threat, Wall Street chugged ever upward and people set about their business with scant recognition of the calamity that lay ahead.
On Thursday, the scope of the economic disaster became clearer as the Labor Department reported the loss of 10 million jobs in only two weeks. Wall Street has seemingly imploded, and the global economy has shuddered as the fallout of the pandemic reaches into every country.
Hopes for a dramatic but brief downturn followed by a quick recovery have faded, and in their place are fears that the world may be on the cusp of an economic shock unseen since the Great Depression.
The speed and scale of the job losses is without precedent. Until last month, the worst week for unemployment filings was 695,000 in 1982.
At his evening coronavirus briefing, President Trump again said he would not reopen the Affordable Care Act’s federal insurance exchange to make it easier for the newly unemployed or the already uninsured to buy deeply subsidized health insurance. But Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that the administration will unveil a plan to directly pay hospitals to treat uninsured coronavirus patients.
Despite the news that 6.6 million people had filed for unemployment benefits last week, the S&P 500 rose more than 2 percent after Mr. Trump said he expected Russia and Saudi Arabia to announce oil production cuts. Oil prices had been hammered as the pandemic all but eliminated travel and demand for energy, and a price war between Saudi and Russia had intensified the decline.
Mr. Trump’s statement led crude oil futures, which had already been climbing on Thursday, to surge, and shares of oil and gas companies also rallied. But by Thursday afternoon the agreement Mr. Trump said he expected had yet to materialize, and neither Russia nor Saudi Arabia publicly committed to such a cut. A Saudi statement issued on Thursday called only for a meeting of oil producing nations to reach a “fair agreement.” The Kremlin cast further doubt on the possibility, denying a claim that Mr. Trump made on Twitter that Mr. Putin had discussed the matter with the crown prince.
With or without a deal, Mr. Trump’s unusual oil diplomacy and his eagerness to claim a victory reflects his growing anxiety about the United States’ coronavirus-gripped economy. It also underscores his sudden reliance, after years of upbeat talk about growing American energy independence, on foreign oil industries. But if Russia and Saudi Arabia fail to strike an agreement that bolsters global oil prices, Mr. Trump will find himself left twisting in the wind by two repressive leaders whose good will he has spent years cultivating at significant political cost.
Trump invokes Defense Production Act, and criticizes 3M.
President Trump took aim on Thursday at the manufacturing giant 3M, which has been increasing production of N95 respirator masks that filter small particles and droplets from the air.
“We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks,” he said in a Twitter message posted just before 9 p.m. in Washington. “Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing — will have a big price to pay!”
At a White House briefing earlier in the day, Mr. Trump announced he was invoking the Defense Production Act, a 1950s law, to help shore up dwindling supplies of masks and other supplies. The move came after desperate pleas from governors and health care officials who are trying to handle the spike in patients infected by coronavirus.
As the virus swept across the country, overwhelming hospitals, 3M had said that it was speeding up production of N95 masks and that it planned to increase output in the United States by 30 percent over the next year.
The company usually makes about 400 million masks a year. It is unclear what set off President Trump, but his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, made an oblique reference to 3M at the briefing, mentioning that “we’ve had some issues making sure that all of the production that 3M does around the world,” ends up being sent “to the right places.”
Even as the U.S. grapples with a mask shortage, 3M has continued to sell the critical safety equipment abroad, according to someone with direct knowledge of the matter. It is not illegal for the company to sell its masks to foreign countries. And the U.S. has been slow to respond in a coordinated way or to marshal federal resources, health officials said. That sluggish response has meant that other governments put in orders ahead of the United States.
The investor Mark Cuban, who is advising Project N95, a new nonprofit group that aims to help American hospitals connect with vetted mask suppliers, speculated that the administration may be upset over a perceived lack of transparency from 3M.
“It’s obvious that there’s not enough supply to meet the demand, and it’s obvious that 3M has manufacturing overseas,” Mr. Cuban said. “What’s not obvious is what percentage of their production overseas 3M has been willing to supply.”
Hospitals report some critical medicines are beginning to run low.
Across the country, as hospitals confront a harrowing surge in coronavirus cases, they are also beginning to report shortages of critical medications — especially those desperately needed to ease the disease’s assault on patients’ respiratory systems.
The most commonly reported shortages include drugs that are used to keep patients’ airways open, antibiotics, antivirals and sedatives. They are all part of a standard cocktail of medications that help patients on mechanical ventilators, control secondary lung infections, reduce fevers, manage pain and resuscitate those who go into cardiac arrest.
Demand for these drugs significantly increased in March as the pandemic took hold. Orders for antibiotics like azithromycin and antiviral medicines like ribavirin nearly tripled. Requests for medicines used for sedation and pain management, including fentanyl, midazolam and propofol, increased by 100 percent, 70 percent and 60 percent respectively.
Demand for albuterol, a common asthma inhaler medication, also has risen significantly, given its importance in easing the breathing of patients with severe infection.
“Just like we’re seeing shortages of other materials, like masks and ventilators, medications are right there in the mix of things that we don’t always have enough of on hand,” said Erin Fox, a drug shortage expert at the University of Utah. “So we were not prepared for this kind of surge.”
The 1,000-bed Comfort was supposed to aid New York. It has 20 patients.
Such were the expectations for the Navy hospital ship U.S.N.S. Comfort that when it chugged into New York Harbor this week, throngs of people, momentarily forgetting the strictures of social distancing, crammed together along Manhattan’s west side to catch a glimpse.
On Thursday, though, the huge white vessel, which officials had promised would bring succor to a city on the brink, sat mostly empty, infuriating local hospital executives.
Only 20 patients had been transferred to the ship, officials said, even as New York hospitals struggled to find space for the thousands infected with the coronavirus. Another Navy hospital ship, the U.S.N.S. Mercy, docked in Los Angeles, has had a total of 15 patients, officials said.
The Comfort was sent to New York to relieve pressure on city hospitals by treating people with ailments other than Covid-19. But the reality has been different.
A tangle of military protocols and bureaucratic hurdles has prevented the Comfort from accepting many patients at all. On top of its strict rules preventing people infected with the virus from coming on board, the Navy is also refusing to treat a host of other conditions. Guidelines disseminated to hospitals included a list of 49 medical conditions that would exclude a patient from admittance to the ship.
“If I’m blunt about it, it’s a joke,” said Michael Dowling, the head of Northwell Health, New York’s largest hospital system. “Everyone can say, ‘Thank you for putting up these wonderful places and opening up these cavernous halls.’ But we’re in a crisis here, we’re in a battlefield.”
Deaths spike in Ecuador, and officials fear a dramatic undercount of virus cases.
Corpses are strewn in the streets of Ecuador or spend days waiting to be picked up from private homes as the number of coronavirus deaths surges. There is no more wood for coffins, leading one cardboard manufacturer to begin producing cardboard caskets.
“We are so beaten down,” a city councilman, Andrés Guschmer, said on Thursday.
He described a collective grief in the normally lively city of fewer than three million people.
Latin America has started to see a rapid rise in cases, and many leaders are preparing for an explosion.
Officially, Ecuador has had 98 deaths because of coronavirus, most of them in Guayaquil, a city where many families have members who work or study in Spain and Italy. But that number is a dramatic undercount, Guayaquil was seeing three or four times the number of deaths it typically sees in a day, he said, adding that the day before they had about 320 deaths.
In Guayaquil, part of the reason for the backlog is that federal regulation requires each death to be assessed by criminal investigators before the body’s removal, but there are not enough investigators, said Mr. Guschmer, who is in charge of coordinating corpse removal with federal officials.
He has urged the national government to change the protocol.
Jorge Wated, an official working on the national government’s response to the crisis, said on Wednesday that deaths in the city could reach 3,500 in coming months.
Among the dead in Guayaquil are four journalists, several of whom were covering the crisis before they died, said César Ricaurte, the director of a media defense group called Fundamedios.
Trump denounces new House oversight committee as “a witch hunt.”
President Trump lashed out at Democrats in Congress on Thursday for announcing the start of oversight investigations into the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus, accusing them of “conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic.”
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said earlier on Thursday that she had created a special select bipartisan committee to oversee all aspects of the government response to the virus, including its distribution of more than $2 trillion in emergency aid. Without citing Ms. Pelosi’s move specifically, the president made clear he objects.
“I want to remind everyone here in our nation’s capital, especially in Congress, that this is not the time for politics, endless partisan investigations,” he said. “Here we go again.”
Mr. Trump repeated the language he often used to describe the investigations into his administration: “You see what happens. It’s a witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt. And in the end, the people doing the witch hunt they’ve been losing, and they’ve been losing by a lot.”
The White House then released a letter that Mr. Trump sent to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, pressing his attack as the nightly coronavirus task force briefing continued.
“I’ve known you for many years but I never knew how bad a Senator you are for New York until I became president,” Mr. Trump wrote, after complaining about “your ridiculous impeachment hoax.”
The N.R.A. sees a threat, and an opportunity, in Covid-19, as it fights to keep gun stores open.
Faced with an invigorated gun control movement, the National Rifle Association has found a new cause amid the pandemic — fighting to keep gun stores open, while depicting the government’s coronavirus response as a threat to Second Amendment rights.
On Thursday, the group sued the State of New York over its decision to include gun retailers among the many businesses that have been forced to close during the crisis. The N.R.A. had already filed two suits against California, where the governor had left the decision to counties.
The suits come as the N.R.A. and other gun groups have successfully lobbied the White House to get the Department of Homeland Security to add firearms vendors to its list of essential businesses. That prompted states like New Jersey to reverse course and allow such stores to remain open. But New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, has resisted, viewing the shutdown of businesses across the state as a vital safety measure.
“There isn’t a single person who has ever used a gun in self-defense who would consider it nonessential,” the N.R.A.’s chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, said in a statement.
Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, said in a statement that “everyone — including the N.R.A. — must follow the law and all executive orders of New York.”
China is undercounting its coronavirus toll, the C.I.A. has found.
The C.I.A. has been warning White House officials since at least February that China is understating its coronavirus numbers — an obfuscation that could have profound impact on health experts’ ability to predict how the virus will spread.
American officials have long viewed many figures and reports out of China with suspicion. But the intelligence about China’s undercount of its coronavirus death toll played a role in President Trump’s negotiation last week of an apparent détente with President Xi Jinping of China after weeks of rising tensions over the virus.
The C.I.A. has its own health experts and epidemiologists who work on classified models of the pandemic’s spread, and intelligence officers seek new information to contribute to those models and improve them. But American intelligence agencies have not obtained better numbers about the death toll in China in large measure because the Chinese government itself does not know how damaging the virus has been.
Midlevel bureaucrats in the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated, and elsewhere in China have been lying about infection rates, testing and death counts, fearful that if they report numbers that are too high they will be punished, lose their position or worse, current and former intelligence officials said.
White House officials believe that China is a month or so ahead of the United States in how the pandemic will play out. And obtaining a more accurate view of the coronavirus toll in China could be critical to heading off a second wave of the pandemic.
New York could deplete its ventilator stockpile in 6 days.
New York State, whose 2,468 coronavirus deaths have made it the center of America’s outbreak, is in danger of depleting its stockpile of critically needed ventilators in just six days, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday.
“If a person comes in and needs a ventilator and you don’t have a ventilator, the person dies,” Mr. Cuomo said. “That’s the blunt equation here.”
The lack of ventilators, which are needed for patients who are incapable of breathing on their own, is emerging as one of the biggest looming dangers of the pandemic. Mr. Cuomo said that the state had sent 400 ventilators from its stockpile on Wednesday night to hard-hit hospitals in New York City and another 200 to hospitals in Long Island and Westchester.
That left just 2,200 ventilators in the state’s stockpile, he said — leading state officials to fear that if their projections hold, they will run through them in six days.
Mr. Cuomo said that buying more ventilators was proving difficult with so much competition from around the nation and the world. So he said that hospitals were taking extraordinary measures to get the most out of their existing ventilators, including splitting ventilators by connecting two patients to machines that are intended for one.
The U.S. government has nearly emptied its emergency stockpile of protective medical supplies like masks, gowns and gloves, a senior official said. Some states receiving desperately needed ventilators from the federal government discovered that the machines did not work.
Mr. Cuomo made a plea, and an offer, to businesses. He said that the state would pay to help manufacturers switch over to the production of needed hospital gowns, gloves and other equipment.
“If you have the capacity to make these products, we will purchase them, and we will pay a premium,” he said. “But we need it, like, now.”
Mr. Trump, under fire for his administration’s failure to respond quickly to the pandemic, lashed out at New York again on Thursday, saying the state’s doctors and hospitals are “never satisfied” with the medical supplies provided by the federal government because of politics.
Mr. Trump said he had ordered his health secretary to use the Defense Production Act to help a half-dozen American companies secure the materials they need to produce more ventilators. The companies listed in the order include General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, ResMed, Royal Philips, and Vyaire Medical.
It was not immediately clear how the new order would affect the production of ventilators or how quickly the companies would be able to provide the devices to hospitals in hot spots like New York City or New Orleans.
A test that may help detect coronavirus immunity is approved.
The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the first test for coronavirus antibodies for use in the United States.
Currently available tests are designed to find fragments of viral DNA indicating an ongoing infection. An antibody test, on the other hand, tells doctors whether a patient has ever been exposed to the virus — and, having recovered, now may have at least some immunity.
That is important for several reasons. People with immunity might be able to venture safely from their homes and help shore up the work force. It may be particularly important for doctors and nurses to know whether they have antibodies.
Antibody testing eventually should give scientists a better sense of how widespread the infection is in the population and help researchers calculate more precisely the fatality rate and the frequency of asymptomatic infections.
Separately, an unproven stem cell therapy derived from human placentas will begin testing in patients with coronavirus, the New Jersey biotech company Celularity said Thursday.
The treatment has not yet been used on any patients with symptoms of Covid-19, but it has caught the attention of Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer. Mr. Giuliani recently featured an interview with the company founder on his website and said on Twitter that the product has “real potential,” while also criticizing the Food and Drug Administration for not moving more quickly to approve potential remedies.
There is no proven treatment for the respiratory disease, but several experimental approaches, including old malaria drugs and H.I.V. antivirals, are being tested in patients around the world.
Amid the pandemic, the United States is now facing a drastic drop in the national blood supply. On Thursday, the F.D.A. that it was reducing the amount of time men who have had sex with men should wait before they give blood from one year to three months.
France is converting part of a food market into a morgue.
In a grim sign of the epidemic’s growing toll in France, the police said on Thursday that a hall at the world’s largest wholesale food market, near Paris, would be turned into a temporary morgue.
Nearly 5,400 people have died because of the epidemic in France. Nearly 60,000 people in France have tested positive for the virus, and over 26,000 of them are hospitalized. Over 6,000 of those are in intensive care, and hospitals in areas that are hardest hit, especially the Paris region, are nearing their maximum capacity.
The police cited “persistent tensions” between hospitals and funeral homes as deaths accelerated. They said coffins would be placed temporarily in the refrigerated hall, which is “offset and isolated” from the rest of the food market, a sprawling 573-acre complex in Rungis.
“This location will make it possible to preserve, in conditions that are the most dignified and acceptable from a sanitary standpoint, the caskets of the deceased awaiting burial or cremation, in France or abroad,” the police said.
The morgue is expected to start operating on Friday.
It was not the first time that the French authorities have used Rungis for a dire health crisis. In 2003, when a brutal heat wave killed thousands of elderly people, 700 bodies were kept in a refrigerated warehouse at the same site.
Trump’s company spoke with a bank and a Florida county about delaying payments on loans, and other obligations.
All over the United States, businesses large and small are seeking breathing room from their lenders, landlords and business partners as they face the financial fallout from the coronavirus crisis.
The president’s family company is among those looking for help.
With some of its golf courses and hotels closed amid the economic lockdown, the Trump Organization has been exploring whether it can delay payments on some of its loans and other financial obligations, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.
Representatives of Mr. Trump’s company have recently spoken with Deutsche Bank, the president’s largest creditor, about the possibility of postponing payments on at least some of its loans from the bank.
And in Florida, the Trump Organization sought guidance last week from Palm Beach County about whether it expected the company to continue making monthly payments on county land that it leases for a 27-hole golf club.
The discussions with Deutsche Bank and Palm Beach County are preliminary, and it isn’t clear whether Mr. Trump’s company will be able to delay or reduce its payments, according to people briefed on the discussions.
“These days everybody is working together,” said Eric Trump, the president’s son, who helps manage the family business. “Tenants are working with landlords, landlords are working with banks. The whole world is working together as we fight through this pandemic.”
The Trump Organization’s requests put lenders and landlords in the awkward position of having to accede or risk alienating the president.
Prepare now, because the virus will resurge, Fauci warns on “The Daily.”
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, said on the Times podcast “The Daily” on Thursday that the threat of the virus resurging will continue until a vaccine is approved.
“I believe that in a few months, hopefully, that we’ll get it under control enough that it won’t be as frightening as it is now, but it will not be an absent threat,” he said. “And the threat of resurgence will be something that we need to make sure that we are prepared for.”
Addressing the delays in testing for the virus across the United States, which left Americans largely blind to the scale of the looming catastrophe until early March, Dr. Fauci said that the government was working to increase capacity.
The government “is right now, today, ramping up to essentially make the private sector the major driving force of the testing,” he said. “Early on, that was not in place. And that’s unfortunate.”
Dr. Fauci, who has advised presidents from both parties on pandemic responses, has become the explainer-in-chief of the pandemic. Since joining the White House coronavirus task force in late January, he has taken on a public role translating the science behind the crisis for the general public — and clarifying President Trump’s false or misleading claims in press briefings.
“The president has his own style,” Dr. Fauci said. “That’s obvious to the American public.” He added, “I don’t think it would be possible for me to influence another person’s style. I mean, that just doesn’t happen.”
Dr. Fauci also looked ahead, to how he believes the crisis will be seen years from now.
“I think it will be remembered as really showing what a great country we are. We have been through, as I’ve said, if you look at the history of our country, some extraordinary ordeals. I mean, world wars and diseases and depressions,” he said. “And we’ve gotten through it. I have a great deal of faith in the spirit of the American people. We’re resilient. We’re going to get over this. And this is going to end.”
Cellphone data shows where social distancing measures worked, and what happened without them.
There are still a dozen states where governors have resisted issuing stay-at-home orders to try to slow the spread of the virus, though localities in some of them have put their own bans in place. An analysis of cellphone location data by The New York Times found that people in the Southeast and other places that waited to enact such orders have continued to travel widely, potentially exposing more people as the outbreak accelerates.
A half-dozen of the most populous counties where residents were still traveling widely last week are in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis did not call for a statewide lockdown until Wednesday. See where America did not stay at home:
The Navy has removed the captain of an aircraft carrier stricken by the virus.
The Navy removed the captain of the stricken aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt on Thursday, only days after he implored his superior officers for more help as a coronavirus outbreak spread aboard the ship, Defense Department officials said.
About 100 sailors have been infected so far.
In a letter that leaked to the news media on Tuesday, Capt. Brett E. Crozier laid out the dire situation unfolding aboard the warship, with almost 5,000 crew members, and described what he said were the Navy’s failures to provide him with the proper resources to combat the virus by moving sailors off the vessel and disinfecting areas on board.
Senior Defense Department officials were angry that the letter found its way first to The San Francisco Chronicle, and then to other news outlets, where it was widely reported.
The decision to remove Captain Crozier came on Thursday, officials said.
The carrier is currently docked in Guam.
U.N. is “missing in action” during pandemic, foreign policy experts say.
The leader of the United Nations has called the coronavirus pandemic the most challenging crisis since World War II and pleaded for a unified global response and a halt to all armed conflicts. But the Security Council — the U.N.’s most powerful arm and the only one empowered to use military force and sanctions — has been conspicuously silent, allowing the secretary general’s calls to be widely disregarded.
Fighting continues unabated in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Afghanistan, Mali and Colombia, among other hot spots. North Korea, which claims to have no coronavirus infections, launched two short-range missiles in recent days, its fourth weapons test in a month.
And there are few immediate indications that the situation will change, causing alarm and frustration among rights groups and foreign policy experts who say the United Nations is failing to fulfill its outsize role as the pandemic rages on across the globe.
Diplomats, former U.N. officials and civil rights groups say the Council’s inaction reflected a bitter standoff between two of its five veto-wielding permanent members — China and the United States — over the origin of the pandemic.
Louis Charbonneau, the United Nations director at Human Rights Watch, said “the Security Council has been entirely missing in action” on the pandemic.
“We’re in a situation widely recognized as our most urgent security issue, with a large portion of the global population on lockdown, and the Security Council is incapable of doing anything,” he said.
Russia sends a planeload of coronavirus aid to the U.S., turning the tables.
In the early 1990s, amid the poverty-ridden collapse of the Soviet Union, American food aid in the form of a flood of cheap chicken thighs — Russians called them “Bush legs” — symbolized the humiliating downfall of a superpower.
Three decades later, Moscow got a chance to turn the tables. A giant An-124 Russian military transport plane landed at Kennedy International Airport in New York on Wednesday, bearing cartons of masks and ventilators from Russia for a pandemic-stricken metropolis.
“If someone had said even just a week ago that the United States would be thanking Russia for humanitarian aid,” an anchor on Russian state television marveled Thursday, “people would have said you’re crazy.”
But with the pandemic increasingly bearing down on Russia, the Kremlin’s propaganda machine appeared to avoid trumpeting the aid shipment lest Russians think that the government was ignoring their own plight.
After plans for the shipment stirred criticism on both sides of the Atlantic, the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said on Thursday that the two countries had in fact evenly split the cost of the medical goods and that Russia could depend on future aid from the United States in fighting the coronavirus.
Pelosi is forming a bipartisan House panel to monitor relief efforts and the administration’s response.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she would form a bipartisan House committee to oversee the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic and the implementation of the more than $2 trillion in government relief provided to confront the crisis.
Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the majority whip, will lead the committee, which will have subpoena power, meaning it will have authority to demand testimony and documents from Mr. Trump’s team about all aspects of their handling of the virus.
Ms. Pelosi said the panel would play a vital role in overseeing the largest government stimulus in modern American history.
“The committee will be acting before the fact to prevent a lot of waste, fraud and abuse,” Ms. Pelosi said, adding that she planned to reach out to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to discuss keeping tabs on the stimulus measure and the trillions of dollars in federal money that will be dispersed across the country.
“There are things that are so new, and the rest, and we want to make sure there are not exploiters out there,” she said, adding “where there’s money, there’s frequently mischief.” It is not clear how successful such a committee would be in extracting answers from the Trump administration about the broader virus response.
“The committee will be empowered to examine all aspects of the federal response to the coronavirus to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being wisely and efficiently spent to save lives, deliver relief and benefit our economy,” Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to Democrats on Thursday.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked if the new select committee is necessary, answered curtly: “I don’t.”
Mr. Trump has repeatedly described his handling of the pandemic as exemplary, even though it has been plagued by missteps, including equipment shortages and a failure to test people early on that cost the government a crucial month it could have spent working to contain the virus. He has a long record of blocking efforts by Congress to oversee his administration, and in signing the stimulus measure, Mr. Trump suggested that he would have control over what information an inspector general overseeing the $500 billion corporate bailout fund would have to share with lawmakers.
Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, told reporters on Thursday that an oversight committee was unnecessary, saying it “seems really redundant.”
In a sudden shift, the U.S. and China are trying to cooperate.
In recent days, the U.S. and China have settled on a tentative, uneasy truce after fighting for weeks over the outbreak, which began in Wuhan, China, and was initially covered up by Communist Party officials.
They have agreed to hold fire on public sniping over the virus and to look for ways to cooperate to slow the contagion.
National security officials and China hawks in the State Department are skeptical the détente will last, but several top Trump advisers argue that the two sides need to work together to suppress the virus and resuscitate the global economy, and that Mr. Trump should not jeopardize their recent trade deal.
A series of shipments of purchased protective gear for medical workers has been arranged and is expected to funnel much-needed masks, gowns and protective gear to hospitals in the coming weeks to the United States.
The truce is limited to actions related to the virus and does not extend to other parts of the increasingly tense relationship between the United States and China. American officials who have long advocated an aggressive stand toward China are still intent on pushing back against Beijing on many fronts, including technology, espionage and military expansionism in Asia.
Panama enforces quarantine regulations by gender.
The authorities in Panama, alarmed by widespread violations of its quarantine rules, have announced new restrictions, dependent on gender. Under rules that will be in place for the first 15 days of April, men and women will have separate days that they are permitted to leave their homes.
Women will be allowed outdoors on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Men will have Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Everyone is required to stay home on Sunday. The new rules will help the authorities keep tighter control over who is on the streets.
“The large number of people circulating outside their homes, despite the mandatory national quarantine, has led the national government to take more severe measures to protect the health of the population,” a government statement said.
Between March 19 and March 31, 5,339 people were arrested after violating the quarantine regulations, the Ministry of Public Security said.
As of Wednesday, Panama reported 1,317 confirmed cases and 32 deaths.
Israel’s prime minister leaves, then re-enters, quarantine.
No sooner had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel ventured out of quarantine, than he was back in on Thursday, as the country and its high officials scrambled to keep up with the spread of the virus, particularly among the country’s ultra-Orthodox population.
Mr. Netanyahu was supposed to have ended a three-day period of self-isolation on Wednesday night after an aide, Rivka Paluch, his adviser on parliamentary and ultra-Orthodox affairs, was found to have contracted the virus.
But overnight Israel’s health minister, Yaakov Litzman, tested positive, as did his wife. That sent Mr. Netanyahu back into quarantine until April 8, according to a statement from his office. It added that the period of quarantine was in line with Ministry of Health guidelines, which mandates 14 days of isolation, to be calculated from the last day of contact with an infected person. Mr. Netanyahu has already tested negative twice.
Israel has more than 6,000 known cases and at least 32 deaths. Israelis are on lockdown, other than for essential work or errands.
In a televised address on Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu said restrictions would be tightened on movement to and from Bnei Brak, a largely ultra-Orthodox suburb of Tel Aviv, where the rate of infection has raised alarms. The police set up roadblocks in the town on Thursday and questioned drivers.
Mr. Netanyahu has looked a bit worn down in his recent television appearances, but explained that he had to do his own hair and makeup.
The face mask debate rages on as cities, like L.A., take their own measures.
Among the many questions raised amid the pandemic is whether healthy people should wear a mask when they’re outside.
While masks were a common sight across East Asia long before the outbreak — worn for a variety of reasons — the official advice from both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been that only the sick or their caregivers should wear masks. But those guidelines may be shifting, and some local officials are moving to get in front of a rule change.
Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles urged residents on Wednesday to use face coverings when in public.
Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, wrote on Twitter on Monday that masks would be handed out at supermarket entrances, and that it was mandatory for shoppers to wear them.
Covering the nose and mouth in public has been required in the Czech Republic since last month. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis, addressed Mr. Trump on Twitter on Sunday, asking the American leader to follow the Czech example.
The president of Slovakia, who made waves on social media last month for wearing fashionable face masks that matched her clothes on official engagements, has also made facial protection in public mandatory. Officials in Jena, a city in eastern Germany, said on Monday that protective masks should be worn inside shops and on local transport, among other places.
And in Boston, officials on Thursday awaited the New England Patriots’ team jet, which was hauling 1.2 million masks to the Northeast for use in Massachusetts and New York.
To enforce new rules, British police use drones, shaming and a ban on Easter egg sales.
Just weeks ago, Prime Minister Boris Johnson seemed genuinely shocked at the suggestion that the police should enforce a coronavirus lockdown in Britain.
But that was before he introduced the most stringent restrictions in recent memory and instructed the authorities to enforce them.
Some police officers have done so with such gusto that a ferocious debate is underway about the balance between collective responsibility and individual liberty.
Few doubt the need for extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of an illness that has already claimed at least 1,789 lives in Britain and infected thousands more, including Mr. Johnson himself.
In one instance, a drone zoomed in on six parked cars and a truck and flashed a stern message: “These vehicles should not be here.”
Next to be shamed was a couple walking a dog on a lonely path. Captured on a film, released by the Derbyshire police, their stroll was judged “not essential” and therefore in breach of British social distancing rules.
Small stores have been instructed not to sell chocolate Easter eggs because they are “nonessential” items.
Jonathan Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, offered praise on Monday for the work of many police forces but also expressed alarm at some overly zealous enforcement.
“In some parts of the country, the police have been trying to stop people from doing things like traveling to take exercise in the open country, which are not contrary to the regulations, simply because ministers have said they would prefer us not to,” he told the BBC. “The police have no power to enforce ministers’ preferences, only legal regulations.”
Trump rebuffs demands to lift tariffs even as the economy falters.
President Trump continues to resist calls from hundreds of companies to drop tariffs he has placed on foreign goods, arguing that the levies do not impose costs on American companies, despite economic evidence to the contrary.
The Trump administration has been weighing an executive order that would defer tariff payments on some imports, though not cancel the levies outright. But Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening that he had yet to approve the measure, and it was not clear if the administration would ultimately proceed with it.
“That might be, but I’m going to have to approve the plan,” Mr. Trump said of lowering tariffs. He pushed back on news reports that he had made a decision, saying, “I approve everything and they haven’t presented it to me, so therefore it’s false reporting.”
People familiar with the deliberations say the administration has been weighing such a deferral, which would apply to the “most-favored nation” tariffs the United States has long imposed on goods from around the globe, rather than the levies Mr. Trump has imposed on Chinese products or foreign metals.
Mr. Trump has been reluctant to reduce any tariffs because he does not believe they hurt American businesses and are instead being paid for by China and other countries.
“China’s paying us,” he said. “We made a deal with China. Under the deal, they’re paying us 25 percent on $250 billion and they pay it.”
People are venturing outside in Spain, but only to join the unemployment line.
For weeks, people in Spain have been ordered to remain in their homes unless they had an urgent reason for going outside. But outside a social security office in the Raval neighborhood of Barcelona on Thursday, hundreds of people said they had no choice but to join the line.
“I have one week left of savings to buy food for my family,” said Mafus Rohman, 33, who said he had opened a bar a week before Spain went into lockdown on March 14.
Mr. Rohman said if the owner of his apartment had not frozen the rent, he would have been on the streets with his wife and their 5-year-old twins. “I don’t have anything else but a huge loan to reimburse,” he said.
Similar scenes played out across the country, where more than 10,000 deaths have been reported. On Thursday, the country recorded its highest daily toll: 950 dead.
The unemployment numbers released on Thursday suggest that the impact on Spain’s work force could be greater than that of the 2008 financial crisis. More than 800,000 Spanish workers lost their jobs in March, the highest monthly drop in modern history.
“The conscious decision not to take measures to protect production is leading us to a crisis without precedent,” said Daniel Lacalle, an economist who is forecasting that Spanish unemployment could reach 35 percent, up from 14 percent before the outbreak.
Myrna Mosca, a 42-year-old housekeeper, waited in line with two friends for food credits. Ms. Mosca said her two employers had asked her to stop coming. “We’ve all been thrown into the unknown,” she said. “All of us.”
Britain, struggling to test health care workers, vows to scale up efforts.
As Britons planned to once again take to their balconies and gardens on Thursday to salute the National Health Service, the news that only 2,000 medical workers had been tested for the virus drew widespread outrage, underscoring the country’s struggles to ramp up its capabilities even as the death toll mounts.
Britain reported 569 deaths on Thursday, the highest daily tally to date, raising the national toll to 2,921.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is in isolation after contracting the virus, sent a video message to the nation Wednesday evening that appeared to have been recorded on a cellphone. He pledged “massively increasing testing.”
“This is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle,” he said. “This is how we will defeat it in the end.”
Many have compared the limited response in Britain to Germany, where testing is widespread and the death rate is relatively low.
Chris Hopson, the chief executive of N.H.S. Providers, which represents hospitals in the National Health Service, told the BBC’s Radio 4 program Today that just 2,000 front-line health care workers had been tested for the virus and that Britain had the capacity to process only about 13,000 tests per day.
He cited shortages in swabs and the reagent needed to process the tests, and said in a statement posted to Twitter that testing capacity was “so constrained” that hospitals were asked to allocate only 15 percent of tests to staff.
The shortages have been a chronic global challenge as governments and health care providers scramble to obtain diagnostic kits, with major disparities in testing capacity. Much of Western Europe has found itself short of kits, and governors across the United States pleaded with the federal government for help in bolstering their own testing capacity.
Trump lashes out at New York political leaders.
Mr. Trump, under fire for his administration’s failure to respond quickly to the pandemic, lashed out at New York again on Thursday, saying the state’s doctors and hospitals are “never satisfied” with the medical supplies provided by the federal government because of politics.
Even as a new report showed that millions of Americans have been forced from their jobs by the pandemic, and death toll in New York continued to rise, Mr. Trump spent the morning attacking Senator Chuck Schumer and other New York politicians, accusing them of failing to adequately prepare the state’s medical system for a serious outbreak.
In fact, officials in New York, which has become the center of the crisis, have repeatedly said that the federal government needed to do more to provide ventilators, masks and other protective gear to overwhelmed hospitals.
Governors around the country have criticized Mr. Trump for not doing more to centralize the provision of medical equipment. And public health officials have said that the administration’s failure to provide adequate testing in late January and February allowed the virus to spread silently throughout the country.
Critics have also said Mr. Trump should have done more to encourage governors to issue stay-at-home orders in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida ordered restrictions on Wednesday, having resisted doing so for days.
In a series of tweets on Thursday, Mr. Trump took particular aim at Mr. Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader, who had criticized the federal response during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program earlier in the morning.
“Look, the president was way behind the eight ball in so much of this,” Mr. Schumer said. “He didn’t see the need. We were way behind in testing.”
In his tweet, Mr. Trump shot back: “somebody please explain to Cryin’ Chuck Schumer that we do have a military man in charge of distributing goods, a very talented Admiral.”
The president also suggested again — without evidence — that needed supplies were somehow going missing or being hoarded at New York hospitals, adding: “stop complaining & find out where all of these supplies are going.”
Even as he attacked New York’s response, Mr. Trump finished one of his tweets with praise for the governor: “Cuomo working hard.”
Mr. Cuomo, who was asked to respond to Mr. Trump’s comments claiming that New York had gotten off to a “late start” but praising him personally, said, “I don’t know how you square those two statements, I don’t know that you can square those two statements.”
Governments are cracking down on people defying stay-at-home orders.
At least 38 states have announced plans for stay-at-home orders that will last for weeks, and governments are now trying to close businesses deemed nonessential that have stayed open.
The arts-and-crafts chain Hobby Lobby drew a rebuke on Wednesday from Colorado officials, who said the retailer must comply with stay-at-home orders and immediately close its stores.
In a cease-and-desist letter to the company, W. Eric Kuhn, the senior assistant state attorney general, wrote that Hobby Lobby’s reopening of stores violated an order by the governor that compelled all businesses to close unless state officials had classified them as critical.
“For the avoidance of doubt, Hobby Lobby is not a ‘critical business,’” Mr. Kuhn wrote.
Ohio’s attorney general, Dave Yost, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that he had sent a similar letter to Hobby Lobby and that the retailer, which did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday night, had agreed to close stores in his state. Officials in Indiana and Wisconsin were also scrutinizing the company.
Other businesses, including small companies, have also tried to remain open, earning the ire of the authorities from coast to coast.
In Los Angeles, where the city attorney said last week that prosecutors would “work toward gaining compliance,” at least eight businesses have been cited for operating in defiance of government orders.
“This is serious, and we cannot allow violations to continue,” Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said at a news conference on Wednesday, when he said that city officials would shut off power and water to nonessential businesses that remained open after being warned.
“No one wants to take this step, and we won’t have to as long as you follow the rules,” Mr. Garcetti said.
The authorities have also said that individuals who breach shelter-in-place orders could be punished, like in Maryland, where violators could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $5,000, and Newark, where officials have issued hundreds of summonses.
“If you are doing people’s hair and you’re not supposed to, if you’re opening up your store and you’re not supposed to, if you’re hanging out on the corner and you infect other people, these things can turn into very serious charges for you,” said Mayor Ras J. Baraka said on Wednesday. “Some people think we’re doing too much, but there’s a lot of people who think we’re not doing enough.”
On Thursday, Mr. Baraka said that the police would patrol the borders between Newark, Orange, East Orange and Irvington, and other areas, to reduce traffic between the four cities.
Officials elsewhere have also pledged to involve the police. In Georgia, where a statewide stay-at-home order is expected to take effect on Friday, Gov. Brian Kemp said that the state patrol was prepared to deal with people who ignored orders from state and local governments.
“The reality is that if you do not comply, you are violating the law, and you can face stiff penalties,” Mr. Kemp said.
The Seattle-area nursing home linked to dozens of deaths faces steep fines over its handling.
A nursing home linked to dozens of coronavirus deaths in the Seattle area faces a fine of more than $600,000 after federal inspectors found a range of problems in how the facility handled the outbreak.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a letter on Wednesday to the company, Life Care Center of Kirkland, that it may be terminated from Medicare and Medicaid participation if the facility is unable to come into compliance with federal regulations by September. Officials levied a fine of $13,585 per day covering a span of six weeks.
Federal officials reported last month that Life Care had failed to notify state officials about the increasing rate of respiratory infections among residents, failed to rapidly identify and manage ill residents and failed to have a backup plan after the facility’s primary clinician fell ill. C.M.S. said those urgent issues have since been resolved, but that Life Care will also need to demonstrate compliance on other issues, including record-keeping and its handling of safety and quality strategies.
“If L.C.C. of Kirkland does not correct all deficiencies and return to full compliance by September 16, 2020, then C.M.S. will terminate your facility from participating in the Medicare/Medicaid program,” wrote Patrick Thrift, a C.M.S. enforcement official in Seattle.
Here’s how to tweak your home to serve you better now.
Your home is currently serving as a work space, living space and possibly a school and playground. It wasn’t designed for all these disparate tasks, but there are things you can do to make your home more comfortable for you and your family in these times.

Full text: With Mariana Alfaro
"I'm a wartime president," Donald Trump reiterated on Sunday night. "This is a war."
But even as he sought the deference historically afforded to leaders at the start of a military conflict, President Trump made clear that he does not want to accept any responsibility for either strategic blunders or tactical failures in the battle against the novel coronavirus. 
As he spoke repeatedly of "winning" against "the hidden enemy," Trump's news conference at the White House starkly illustrated an unabashed effort to have his cake and eat it too.
The president was widely ridiculed last week for ripping into NBC's Peter Alexander after being asked the softball question of what message he would like to deliver to Americans who are afraid. Attempting a do-over of sorts, Trump sounded a soothing, if scripted, note when he entered the briefing room.
"For those worried and afraid, please know as long as I am your president you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you, and I will not stop until we win," he said. "This will be a great victory. … And it's going to be a victory that, in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected."
Trump then repeatedly sought to pass the buck, primarily to Democratic governors. "The governors, locally, are going to be in command," he explained. "We will be following them, and we hope they can do the job."
A few hours earlier, Trump ripped Democratic governors who had criticized his handling of the pandemic on the Sunday talk shows. "We're all building the airplane as we fly it right now," Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on ABC. "It would be nice to have a national strategy." The president tweeted that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Whitmer and others "shouldn't be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings." Describing his view of the federal role, the president wrote: "We are there to back you up should you fail."
In 2011, a White House official described President Barack Obama's approach to Libya as "leading from behind" during an interview on background with the New Yorker. Prominent Republicans spent the remainder of Obama's presidency mocking him for this formulation, even though there's no evidence he ever used it.
But this has seemingly been Trump's mentality toward the coronavirus outbreak. He told the governors on a conference call last week that they should procure their own medical equipment in case the federal government cannot deliver. "Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves," he told them. 
We've come a long way from "I alone can fix it," as Trump declared at the Republican National Convention in 2016, to "I don't take any responsibility at all," as the president said at the White House 10 days ago.
After Trump said the federal government is following the lead of the states, Vice President Pence explained how "that is the way our system works": "It's extremely important that the American people recognize that one of the things that makes America different is that we have a system of federalism."  The former governor of Indiana said: "It is locally executed, state managed, and federally supported. We want the people on the ground, the decision-makers, to have what they need."
But many of those decision-makers on the ground say the Trump administration is not giving them what they need to contain covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Responding to a demand from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), Trump on Sunday authorized the federal construction of four temporary hospitals sites, with 250 beds each to start. Trump also said he has ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ship mobile hospital centers to New York, as well as California and the state of Washington. At the White House, the president read aloud a list of supplies being deployed by the government.
But Trump continues to resist pleas by governors, especially Cuomo, to fully use his authorities under the Defense Production Act. The 1950 law was enacted during the Korean War to allow the government to stock up on wartime materials like aluminum and copper. Trump technically invoked the power last week, but he has not used it to the extent that he could to either allocate scarce resources to the states that need them most or mandate production by private companies. "Former Pentagon officials who handled Defense Production Act policy for Democratic and Republican administrations said the Trump administration has so far made little use of the law," Bob Costa and Aaron Gregg report.
Trump said the "threat" that he could use these powers in the future is coaxing companies into complying voluntarily or offering to help without being asked. He expressed fear that nationalizing an industry would transform the United States into Venezuela. "The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept," Trump said. "We have the threat of doing it if we need it. … We may have to use it some place along the chain, but we're getting calls. Here's the beauty of it."
Democratic governors said they're not talking about nationalizing industries but allocating resources to make sure everyone gets what they need. "If I had the power, I would do it in New York state because the situation is that critical," Cuomo said at his own daily briefing. "I think the federal government should order factories to manufacture masks, gowns, ventilators – the essential medical equipment that's going to make the difference between life and death. … If the federal government does it, then they can do it in a very orderly way. They can decide how many they need, they can designate how many each factory should produce and then they could distribute those goods by need, rather than having the states all compete against each other."
Cuomo said federal inaction has allowed "price gouging" for these products. "I'll contract with a company for 1,000 masks. They'll call back 20 minutes later and say the price just went up because they had a better offer," he said. "And I understand that: Other states who are desperate for these goods, literally, offer more money than we were paying. … The states simply cannot manage it. I'm competing with California and Illinois and Florida. And that's not the way it should be."
FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor said the president has "leverage" to get private companies to ramp up the production of ventilators and protective masks. "What I'll say is: If you can find it on the open market, go buy it," he said on NBC. "Any governor that needs it, and you find it, go buy it."
Indeed, many businesses are stepping up production absent dictates from the federal government. 3M says that it is shipping half a million protective N95 masks for medical workers to New York and Seattle, and they'll start arriving today. The Minnesota-based manufacturer said it will almost double production of the masks over the next year to an annual rate of 2 billion masks worldwide.
Even with the surge in supply, Pritzker, the Illinois governor, complained that it's still "a wild West out there" and everyone is overpaying for personal protective equipment as a result. "I've got people working the phones calling across the world, frankly, to get this stuff to Illinois," he said on CNN.
It's not just Democrats who want the administration to do more. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), the chairman of the National Governors Association, said FEMA "has to take the lead" in getting medical items because states like his are scrambling to find supplies on their own. "We are getting some progress. Now, it's not nearly enough. It's not fast enough. We're way behind the curve," Hogan said on NBC. 
There are now about 35,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States and more than 470 reported deaths . More than 15,000 New Yorkers had tested positive as of Sunday, and about 2,000 of them have required hospitalization. Most of these cases are in the Big Apple. "We are very much on our own at this point," said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D). "April is going to be a lot worse than March, and May could be worse than April."
Trump said he has "a great relationship" with Cuomo and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), and that they're putting aside political differences to do what's best for their people. "We're really backing up the governors," Trump said. "The governors have to go out and do their thing. And you have a lot of governors, they've done a fantastic job. You have some that haven't. Usually it's the ones that complain that have the problems."
Moments after calling for Americans to unify during his White House briefing, Trump snarked when he learned that Mitt Romney had chosen to self-quarantine because of his exposure to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who tested positive for the coronavirus. "Romney's in isolation? Gee, that's too bad," the president said sarcastically, referring to the only Republican senator who voted to convict him during the impeachment trial. Romney is being cautious because his wife, Ann, has multiple sclerosis, which makes her more vulnerable to the coronavirus and made the president's remarks sound even more callous.
During the news conference, Trump also refused to commit to not filling his own pockets with taxpayer bailout money meant for hotels. He complained that "nobody said thank you" when he donated his salary to charity. "So, I've learned: Let's just see what happens," he said. "Because we have to save some of these great companies." This seemed to be a reference to his own company. Once again, he found a way to make the pandemic about himself. A few minutes later, he claimed dubiously – and repeatedly – that it is costing him "billions" of dollars in missed opportunities to serve as president.
When a reporter asked Trump whether he'd consider reaching out to Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter – who all faced crises during their tenure in the White House – Trump said he doesn't need them or whatever wisdom they might have to offer. Trump criticized Obama's handling of the H1N1 pandemic 11 years ago and Bush's handling of Hurricane Katrina 15 years ago. Trump appeared to reference an ABC News-Ipsos poll released Friday that showed 55 percent of Americans approved of the way he's handling the coronavirus response.
"All you have to do is look at the approval numbers on the job we're doing," he said. "I think we're doing an incredible job. So I don't want to disturb them [or] bother them. I don't think I'm going to learn much."
"I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down," said Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, referencing Trump's stream of false statements during televised briefings. "OK, he said it. Let's try and get it corrected for the next time." (Science magazine) 
The Federal Reserve announced an unlimited expansion of bond purchasing programs. "The Fed is taking swift action never done before in its history to ensure businesses, individuals and local governments can get loans to tide them over until the economy bounces back," Heather Long reports. "As part of these efforts, the Fed said Monday it would purchase Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities 'in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning,' effectively putting no limits on how many assets the Fed is willing to buy. This extraordinary move goes even further than the 2008-09 financial crisis playbook. … The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 300 points when trading began on Wall Street. Economists have dubbed this the 'do whatever it takes' moment for the Fed. Some analysts on Twitter compared it to when talk show host Oprah gave everyone in the audience a car."
The coronavirus stimulus package hit a speed bump as Senate Democrats voice objections.  "Lawmakers had hoped to pass the enormous $1.8 trillion bill by Monday but Sunday night they were scrambling to revive talks, with the stock market poised for another sharp drop and households and businesses fretting about an uncertain future," Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim, Rachael Bade and Jeff Stein report. "Negotiations continued even as the initial procedural vote fell short, with 47 senators voting in favor and 47 opposed. The tally was well short of the 60 votes that were needed to move forward. The number of 'aye' votes was especially low because five Republicans are quarantined over coronavirus fears. … Ever since Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) introduced the legislation Thursday night, senators have missed one self-imposed deadline after another to reach a deal. The vote Sunday evening was delayed three hours so talks could continue after it became clear it would fail, but no resolution was reached and it failed anyway. …
" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin played shuttle diplomacy all afternoon and night, exiting the Capitol just before midnight after his sixth face-to-face meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) while expressing optimism. … And while Schumer also struck an upbeat tone -- saying he was 'very hopeful' of a deal Monday morning – McConnell left the Capitol visibly angry and blaming Schumer for blowing up an emerging deal early Sunday. If the sides do not reach a pact by the early afternoon, a series of votes will unfold that are like to be a replay of Sunday's blocked path, except this time the U.S. financial markets will be open and trading. … 
"Senate Democrats and Republicans spent Friday and Saturday negotiating over the legislation with both sides saying they'd made progress, until McConnell announced late Saturday he was moving forward on drafting a bill even though there wasn't yet a final deal. … House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), meanwhile, suggested that House Democrats might chart their own course and release their own bill, which could put the Democratic-led House and the Republican-led Senate on different tracks and delay final agreement on any deal. … 
" A major sticking point is a $500 billion pool of money for loans and loan guarantees that Republicans want to create, which some Democrats are labeling a 'slush fund' because the Treasury Department would have broad discretion over who receives the money. There is little precedent for a program with a similar size and scope. … The biggest subset of this $500 billion fund would be $425 billion in loans and loan guarantees meant to rescue 'eligible businesses, states or municipalities.' … Trump has already talked about how he wants to help the cruise industry and the hotel industry, but dozens of other industries have pleaded for assistance as well. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called the bucket of money a 'slush fund to boost favored companies and corporate executives -- while they continue to pull down huge paychecks and fire their workers.'
"This section also includes $50 billion for passenger airline companies, $8 billion for cargo air firms, and $17 billion for companies deemed critical to the U.S.'s national security. The legislation does not include many restrictions on the companies that receive these funds. For example, companies are required to maintain the same employment levels that they had as of March 13 'to the extent practicable,' but it does not define what practicable means. The bill does appear to prohibit stock buybacks at firms that receive the emergency loans and gives the Treasury Department the opportunity to take equity stakes in the firms so that taxpayers could benefit if a firm regains its financial footing. The $350 billion small business program appeared to have broad bipartisan support, but processing this program could be a major logistical challenge because of the potential number of firms that could seek to have government support."
Rand Paul was the first senator to test positive.  "He is feeling fine and is in quarantine," the Kentucky Republican's office said in a statement. "He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person." Paul's office added that "virtually no staff" have had contact with him since his D.C. office began operating remotely 10 days ago, Felicia Sonmez, Seung Min Kim and Paul Kane report. "But word of Paul's diagnosis prompted two of his fellow senators, Republicans Mike Lee and Mitt Romney, both of Utah, to announce that they were self-quarantining because of their recent contact with him. … Paul received his test results Sunday morning, according to his deputy chief of staff, Sergio Gor. … 
"Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) told fellow senators that Paul was working out in the Senate gym Sunday morning. Moran also said Paul was swimming in the pool. Asked about Paul's Sunday morning whereabouts, Gor said, 'As soon as he got the results, he left the building.' … Romney, 73, said in a statement that he 'has no symptoms but will be tested.' … Other Republican senators appeared unnerved … The news prompted some senators to call for the chamber to allow for votes to be cast remotely. … Paul took part in Friday's Senate Republican luncheon at the Capitol. He was the lone senator to vote 'no' this month on an $8.3 billion emergency spending measure to fight the outbreak and … was among eight senators to vote against a relief package that ensures paid leave for many Americans." Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) said Paul's decision not to self-quarantine while waiting for the test results was "absolutely irresponsible." Paul tested positive days after his father said the coronavirus was a hoax. 
Amy Klobuchar announced that her husband, John Bessler, has tested positive for the coronavirus. "We just got the test results at 7 a.m. this morning," she said in a statement. "While I cannot see him and he is of course cut off from all visitors, our daughter Abigail and I are constantly calling and texting and emailing. John started to feel sick when I was in Minnesota and he was in Washington D.C. and like so many others who have had the disease, he thought it was just a cold. Yet he immediately quarantined himself just in case and stopped going to his job teaching in Baltimore. He kept having a temperature and a bad, bad cough and when he started coughing up blood he got a test and a chest X-ray and they checked him into a hospital in Virginia because of a variety of things including very low oxygen levels which haven't really improved. He now has pneumonia and is on oxygen but not a ventilator. 
"While this is his story and not mine, I wanted to let my colleagues and constituents know that since John and I have been in different places for the last two weeks and I am outside the 14-day period for getting sick, my doctor has advised me to not get a test," Klobuchar added. "As everyone is aware, there are test shortages for people who need them everywhere and I don't qualify to get one under any standard. I love my husband so very much and not being able to be there at the hospital by his side is one of the hardest things about this disease."

The infected talked with us about what it feels like to have the coronavirus. "Ritchie Torres, 32, a New York City councilman from the Bronx, first had nothing more than a 'general sickly feeling.' Then came a bad headache. He felt terrible. But for Torres, the worst effects of covid-19 so far have been mental: 'It is psychologically unsettling to know I am carrying a virus that could harm my loved ones,'" Joel Achenbach, Ben Guarino and Ariana Eunjung Cha report. "The Rev. Jadon Hartsuff, 42, an Episcopal priest in Washington, D.C., felt drained after a Sunday service on Feb. 23. He took a nap. No big deal — the service can be tiring. The next day at the gym, his muscles ached. He became fatigued, feverish, slightly dizzy. 'I kept telling people I felt spongy,' he recalls. 'Like a kitchen sponge.' Mike Saag, 64, an infectious disease doctor in Alabama, developed a cough, like a smoker's hack. He was bone-tired, his mind foggy. About five days in, the misery intensified. … 
"In sharing their experiences, they are helping to demystify this alarming contagion. Covid-19 can be a severe illness, even deadly. But it varies from person to person, and most people with a confirmed infection do not require hospitalization. … This is a slow-developing illness, and it lingers, the whole process typically playing out in weeks rather than days."
Losing your ability to smell and taste may be a clue that you're infected.
"On Friday, British ear, nose and throat doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease's spread," the Times reports. 
The coronavirus may have a weakness.
"Although there are incidents of rampant spread, as happened on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, the coronavirus more often infects clusters of family members, friends and work colleagues, said Dr. David L. Heymann, who chairs an expert panel advising the World Health Organization on emergencies," the NYT reports. "No one is certain why the virus travels in this way, but experts see an opening nonetheless. 'You can contain clusters,' Dr. Heymann said. 'You need to identify and stop discrete outbreaks, and then do rigorous contact tracing.'"
Nearly 70 drugs or experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus. A team of researchers published a list of them on Sunday night on the web site bioRxiv. "Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch," per the Times. Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis patients suddenly can't access their crucial medication because Trump tweeted it out as a potential, but unproven, treatment, ProPublica notes.
Gilead Sciences, a major pharmaceutical company, is halting access to an experimental drug used to treat the novel coronavirus in emergencies. Amid an "exponential increase" in requests for the drug, called remdesivir, Gilead said it wanted more of those receiving the antiviral to participate in a clinical trial. (Teo Armus)
Daily life has come to a near halt around the world. As Italy's death toll leaps by hundreds each day, a frantic Europe is scrambling for hospital beds, ventilators and medical supplies. "A team of firefighters and volunteers turned a 15,000-square-foot convention center hall in Vienna into a new 880-bed coronavirus hospital over the course of a weekend," Loveday Morris, William Booth and Luisa Beck report. "Soldiers in Germany, France and Spain have been deployed to help build similar temporary facilities for thousands of patients. Across Europe, tens of thousands of nurses and doctors are being graduated early or called back from retirement. … Countries are competing against one another for medical supplies on an international market that has been sucked dry." 
Governments extended lockdowns across the world , Shane Harris reports: 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was placed under quarantine after being treated by a doctor on Friday who tested positive for the virus. Merkel banned meetings of more than two people to slow the virus.
Spain is extending its national lockdown for another 15 days. The country has more than 33,000 confirmed cases of infection, and more than 2,100 people have died.
Britain, which has confirmed more than 5,000 infections and 282 deaths, planned to notify 1.5 million people with serious health issues that they should not leave their homes for the next 12 weeks.
Italy continued to confine its citizens to their homes. Authorities reported 651 new deaths on Sunday (for a total of 5,476), which was the lowest percentage increase since the beginning of the outbreak. Some took that cautiously as a sign that strict quarantine measures were helping.

The U.S. axed a CDC position in Beijing that was intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China. "The American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China's disease control agency, left her post in July," Reuters reports. "'It was heartbreaking to watch,' said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the [CDC], between 2007 and 2011. 'If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.' Zhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases."
The biggest worry for many Americans right now is their April 1 rent and mortgage payments.  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told Bloomberg News on Sunday that the unemployment rate could hit 30 percent between April and June because of mass layoffs. "Millions of Americans don't know how they will get the money in time to make rent. The nation has 40 million renters, who tend to be younger. Black and Hispanic families are twice as likely to rent than white households," Heather Long and Renae Merle report. 
Eviction notices are still being issued, as millions are told to shelter in place.  "Federal actions announced last week would protect more than 30 million homeowners from eviction, but they do not cover the nation's 40 million renters. HUD issued a 60-day moratorium on evictions for homeowners who are unable to pay their federally backed mortgages," Jessica Contrera and Tracy Jan report. "While some governors, mayors, city councils and judges are taking action, most state- and municipal-wide moratoriums on evictions last only a few weeks … Without a national moratorium on evictions, housing advocates say, some of the country's most vulnerable people will lose the homes that could keep them from contracting the virus."

Coronavirus cases in the D.C. region spiked, as testing ramped up.  The overall tally of known covid-19 cases in this area rose to 586 on Sunday. There were 221 known cases in Virginia, 245 in Maryland and 120 in the District, in addition to eight related deaths. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) emphasized the likely long duration of the pandemic and suggested schools may need to be closed for an extended period. D.C. officials announced restrictions to limit public access to the Tidal Basin, where people have been crowding to see the cherry blossoms, including barring pedestrian and bicycle traffic and deploying the D.C. National Guard to enforce a restricted access zone. Metro said it hopes to provide riders with reduced but steady service after a week of drastic cutbacks and sudden shifts that left some people stranded. Metrobus riders will be required to board using the rear doors, making their trips essentially free. (Ann Marimow, Gregory Schneider and Fenit Nirappil)
As the virus spreads, so do doubts about America's ability to meet the moment.  "'We hit dark moments before in U.S. history, and this is clearly one of them,' said Douglas Brinkley, a historian at Rice University. 'It doesn't help that the federal government is perceived as utterly dysfunctional.' But, Brinkley added, Americans throughout the country have shown impressive mettle in dealing with a virus … Hospital workers are treating thousands of patients during day-long shifts. Healthy people are volunteering to help their vulnerable neighbors with everyday tasks. Most Americans are abiding by instructions to stay home," Toluse Olorunnipa, Griff Witte and Seung Min Kim report. 
There are ways you can help during the outbreak. Several nonprofit groups could use your time or money to care for vulnerable populations. We've prepared a list here. We're also tracking coronavirus-related cancellations, closings and postponements. The hope is for our list to eventually become a list of reopenings and rescheduled events.
While many get to telework, others must show up to work. This has shined a light on America's racial and educational divides. "The people most at risk for getting sick, because they must venture out, are largely people of color, those with only a high school education and those whose incomes are likely to suffer during the ongoing crisis," Christian Davenport, Aaron Gregg and Craig Timberg report.

Full text: The partisan fight over the government response to the virus echoes the debate in 2014, when Ebola featured prominently in congressional races.
WASHINGTON -- Last week on Fox News, Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, lamented how it was "very disappointing to see the other party trying to politicize" coronavirus when national unity should be the order of the day. But six years ago, it was a different story when Mr. Cotton, then running for the Senate as Republicans worked to seize the majority, hit the Obama administration for "not protecting our country and our families from Ebola."
Mr. Cotton was far from the only one.
Republican candidates and their conservative allies pounded Democrats and the Obama White House over their handling of the Ebola crisis in the weeks before the 2014 elections, capitalizing on it as part of an aggressive campaign strategy that ultimately flipped nine Democratic Senate seats and won them the majority they still hold today. Ebola was far from the only issue in that election, but it was an important one, and it came in the pivotal late stage of the campaign as something of an October surprise.
It was a stark example of how a nationwide health crisis and the public anxiety it can provoke can be exploited as powerful political weapons in election years. Now, with the tables turned and a Republican president in the White House, Democrats are working to use the administration's response to the novel coronavirus to amplify their own campaign messages, and Republicans are quick to charge that they are improperly politicizing the outbreak.
"North Carolinians deserve to know: Will Senator Tillis push for adequate resources for this public health outbreak?" read a statement from the North Carolina Democratic Party circulated on Monday, taking aim at Thom Tillis, a vulnerable incumbent.
The wariness in both parties over coronavirus -- and the desire to avoid any electoral recriminations because of it -- was evident this week as lawmakers struck a speedy deal to pass an $ 8.3 billion emergency response package, agreeing to a sum well in excess of the spending sought by President Trump.
Mr. Trump, who had slammed the Obama administration on its Ebola response in 2014, was at it again on Wednesday, this time blaming regulations by his predecessor for having hindered coronavirus testing. (Health experts and people who served during Barack Obama's presidency said they were unaware of any policy or rule changes that would have affected the availability of tests.)
Last week, Mr. Trump accused Democrats of having exaggerated the coronavirus threat for political gain, calling it their latest "hoax."
With such a crucial election looming, the outbreak is likely to remain a volatile point of contention between the two parties despite Republican calls for disarmament now that they control the Senate and White House. While the elections are months away, some public health experts believe it is possible that the virus could subside this summer only to re-emerge in the fall, just as voters prepare to cast their ballots.
"It shouldn't be partisan," Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican and an orthopedic surgeon, said this week, adding that he was disturbed by the political debate surrounding the coronavirus. "It shouldn't be an effort of the one side to play politics with the presidential election. We're all in this fight together to protect the health and safety of the American people."
Democrats don't dispute the latter point. But they say their coronavirus criticisms are legitimate and that it is Republicans who are politicizing the issue by trying to shield Mr. Trump's management from necessary scrutiny.
"What we are doing is holding the administration accountable, and they don't like being held accountable," said Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland. "When the president goes around the country spreading misinformation, it is not political to give the public the truth about the situation."
House Democrats began airing digital ads this week against seven vulnerable Republicans, urging them to break with the White House to guarantee that an affordable coronavirus vaccine will be available. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, demanded that the ads be pulled, suggesting that Democrats were dragging out emergency funding negotiations to enable the political attacks.
"Are they playing politics and holding the money up so their political arm can attack Republicans on this issue?" he said. "Can they, for one time, put people before politics?"
Democrats said they were simply highlighting administration resistance to taking action to lower drug prices, a theme they have made a centerpiece of their 2020 campaign to hold the House majority.
"The American people are demanding an affordable treatment for the coronavirus," said Robyn Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
As part of the agreement struck on Wednesday, House Democrats dropped their demand for substantial funding to make bulk government purchases of treatments and vaccines so they could be distributed to the public free of charge, but they secured additional funding to make them more affordable.
The Republican call for nonpartisan solidarity has not escaped the notice of veterans of the Obama administration who found themselves under fire over Ebola in the fall of 2014. Republicans regularly accused the White House of a lack of preparedness even though less than a dozen people were ultimately treated for the disease in the United States. Two who contracted it elsewhere died in American hospitals.
"I am disappointed but not surprised that so many Republicans have chosen to politicize this threat as they chose to politicize Ebola," said Denis McDonough, who was chief of staff to Mr. Obama in 2014. "Crisis response demands -- and the American people are right to expect -- science, calm and transparency."
While the White House was under siege in October 2014, the Ebola issue was bubbling up in congressional races around the country, with Republicans linking it to a need for tighter border security and claiming it illustrated Obama administration incompetence. Democrats, in turn, accused Republicans and House members running for the Senate such as Mr. Cotton and Cory Gardner of Colorado of having voted to cut crisis response funding in the past.
Mark Pryor, the incumbent Arkansas Democrat trying to hold off Mr. Cotton, struck first, airing a commercial criticizing the Republican for his budget votes. Mr. Cotton pushed back at a televised debate and questioned the administration's performance in protecting the country.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cotton said she saw no conflict between the senator's call for unity now and his jabs at the Obama White House then.
"I think the primary difference is the Trump administration has taken this seriously from the beginning," said Caroline Tabler of Mr. Cotton's office. "The Obama administration let this play out over several months before they took any steps."
The Ebola outbreak also opened the door to other Republican Senate contenders such as Joni Ernst in Iowa and Mr. Tillis denouncing what they called a lack of leadership from the White House and demanding enhanced border security.
Those contenders -- Ms. Ernst, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Tillis and Mr. Gardner -- and others won their 2014 races for Congress at least in part because of their ability to sow doubts in the minds of home-state voters about the Obama administration's ability to keep them secure in the face of a serious public health threat.
Now, with the roles reversed, they are likely to face their own questions from challengers and voters about whether they, Mr. Trump and their party are up to the job of keeping Americans safe from the coronavirus.

Full text: Coronavirus claimed the lives of two passengers from the Diamond Princess Thursday, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported, marking the first confirmed cruse ship deaths.
The Japanese man and woman, both said to be in their 80s, had left the ship last week and were hospitalized. Both passengers reportedly had underlying conditions.
Meanwhile, Chinese leader Xi Jinping is striking an increasingly confident note that the country can control the coronavirus outbreak and manage the economic and social fallout, as some Chinese health experts predict a peak in infections by the end of the month.
Chinese leaders, eager to kick-start economic activity, have dismantled some highway checkpoints, while businesses have begun to reopen. As of Wednesday, however, restrictions on personal mobility remained tight, suggesting wariness about rising infections.
China on Wednesday reported that the rate of new cases continues to decline, but international experts, including Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, say they are wary of declaring that the pace of worldwide infections is slowing. Here's what we know:

● Beijing's central Xicheng district said it would seal off residential compounds for almost half a million residents in one of the strictest control policies to reach the Chinese capital.
● China tallied a total of 394 new infections and 136 deaths through the end of Wednesday, making the cumulative total 74,546 infections and 2,118 deaths — the overwhelming majority still occurring in central Hubei province .
● Hong Kong reported its second death, a 70-year-old man.
● New stricter criteria for diagnosing coronavirus cases will likely result in further drops in the rate of new infections reported.
● In Japan, an infectious disease specialist slammed conditions on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where 79 new cases were reported Wednesday, saying officials endangered lives by failing to observe proper quarantine practices.
● Iran reported its first two cases of the virus, raising the number infected with the coronavirus in the Middle East to 12, including in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
● The number of coronavirus cases in South Korea increased substantially Thursday, rising by nearly two-thirds to 82.

10:30 PM: Coronavirus claims lives of two passengers from Diamond Princess cruise ship
A Japanese man and woman who were passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died Thursday, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, marking the first time a cruise ship passenger has died.
The 87-year-old man and 84-year-old woman died Thursday after being hospitalized on Feb. 11 and Feb. 12, respectively, according to NHK, citing government officials. Both passengers reportedly had underlying conditions and were confirmed to be infected with the new coronavirus.
At least 621 people have contracted the virus aboard the ship, with 79 new cases being confirmed Wednesday. Despite the new cases, hundreds of passengers who have tested negative for the new coronavirus began disembarking from the ship Wednesday as a 14-day quarantine ended.
Also on Wednesday, the first Diamond Princess crew member to test positive for coronavirus earlier this month was discharged from a Japanese hospital.
The disembarkation of passengers is expected to continue through Friday.
Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday issued a "Level 1" travel warning for Japan, urging people to practice typical safety precautions when traveling to the country to prevent illness.
The CDC said it does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to Japan.

9:20 PM: Coronavirus deaths in China eclipse 2,100
China's National Health Commission early Thursday confirmed 394 new coronavirus infections, 1,117 suspected cases and 114 deaths nationwide in the past 24 hours, raising the country's cumulative totals to 74,546 infections, 4,922 suspected cases and 2,118 reported deaths.
In its update, the health commission also said 1,779 people were discharged from the hospital Wednesday, bringing the total number of discharged patients to 16,155.

9:00 PM: Total coronavirus cases in South Korea increase by nearly two-thirds
South Korea reported 31 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, increasing its total by nearly two-thirds to 82.
All of the latest cases except one in Seoul were in the southern city of Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang province, Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
Of those, 23 cases were linked to church services that a 61-year-old known patient had attended, according to the KCDC.
Shincheonji Church of Jesus released a statement on Wednesday that 10 churchgoers contracted the virus from the 61-year-old woman. The church in Daegu she attended has been shut since Tuesday and is currently undergoing investigations, the statement said.

8:30 PM: Coronavirus patient discharged from UC San Diego Medical Center after making full recovery
A patient being treated for novel cornoavirus at a San Diego hospital was released Wednesday after fully recovering from the virus, UC San Diego Health said in a statement.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified UC San Diego Health that a patient at the facility had fully recovered. The facility has worked closely with the CDC to receive individuals with symptoms to rule out the coronavirus infection.
"Patients who are cleared for hospital discharge have been confirmed through rigorous testing that includes consecutive negative test results provided by the CDC," UC San Diego Health wrote in a statement. The facility said the patient discharged Wednesday is no longer under federal quarantine or isolation commands.
UC San Diego Health was scrutnized last week when a confirmed coronavirus patient was mistakenly discharged due to a laboratory error. The patient was among three evacuees from China placed in isolation at the facility in early February and underwent testing after showing signs of the novel coronavirus.

6:30 PM: How epidemics like COVID-19 end (and how to end them faster)
A coronavirus, recently named COVID-19, has infected more than 70,000 people since it was first reported in late 2019. To predict how big the epidemic could get, researchers are working to determine how contagious the virus is.
As governments and public health agencies work to treat infected people and control the spread of COVID-19, researchers are using mathematical models to estimate how contagious it is and how far it could spread. One such model has indicated that the number of cases may peak this month.

5:20 PM: Amid coronavirus outbreak, mask producers fear shortages
As the number of coronavirus cases in China skyrocketed in the past week, a small Texas manufacturer was inundated with orders from 8,000 miles away. Then, Stephen K. Bannon reached out.
Prestige Ameritech, the largest full-line domestic surgical mask manufacturer, was producing 600,000 masks each day but struggling to meet demand. Mike Bowen, the company's executive vice president, received cold calls on his cellphone from people saying they represented foreign governments and wanted to make bulk purchases. The Hong Kong government and Hong Kong International Airport wanted more. Everyone was hunting for masks.
Instead of celebrating the business boom, Bowen was indignant. This is the precise scenario he began warning about almost 15 years ago, when he pleaded with federal agencies and lawmakers to boost U.S. production of medical masks. He had predicted an eventual health scare and not enough manufacturers. He was right.
So there Bowen was last week as a guest on Bannon's "War Room: Pandemic" podcast, tormented that no one in power had listened. Bannon, a former top adviser to President Trump, has long cautioned about the decline of U.S. manufacturing.
"What I've been saying since 2007 is, 'Guys, I'm warning you, here's what is going to happen, let's prepare,' " Bowen said on the program. "Because if you call me after it starts, I can't help everybody."
The coronavirus outbreak has led to a health crisis, a diplomatic fiasco and, increasingly, an economic mess. It has also exposed major vulnerabilities in the medical supply chain. Many U.S. companies, especially hospitals and pharmaceutical firms, rely on Chinese manufacturers for products ranging from the active ingredients of prescription drugs to protective gear like masks and gloves. Now, much appears upended.

2:45 PM: Researchers produce first 3-D map of coronavirus
Researchers have produced the first 3-D map of the coronavirus, a development that may help the development of a vaccine or antiviral medicine.
The research, which maps the molecular structure of SARS-CoV-2, was published in the journal Science on Wednesday. A team at the University of Texas at Austin collaborated with researchers at the National Institutes of Health.
They were able to produce their 3-D atomic-level scale map of the part of the virus that attaches to and infects human cells. That part — called the spike protein — could prove essential as researchers race to produce a vaccine.
The team at Austin had already been studying other viruses in the coronavirus family and developing ways of locking their spike proteins into a shape that made them easier to analyze.
"As soon as we knew this was a coronavirus, we felt we had to jump at it," said Jason McLellan, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who led the research, in a statement. "We knew exactly what mutations to put into this, because we've already shown these mutations work for a bunch of other coronaviruses."
The researchers worked quickly, designing and producing samples of their spike protein within two weeks of receiving the genome sequence of the virus from Chinese researchers. It took roughly another two weeks to reconstruct the 3-D atomic-scale map.
McLellan's team said they plan to work next on using the molecule they mapped to see if they can isolate antibodies produced by previously infected patients who have recovered from the virus — in hopes of producing a treatment for people soon after they are exposed to the virus.

2:15 PM: PlayStation no longer attending Boston video game showcase due to coronavirus concerns
Sony Interactive Entertainment has decided to cancel its plans to attend a major video game showcase in Boston beginning Feb. 27 due to concerns about the coronavirus. The publishing company announced the decision Wednesday afternoon with a short update to an existing post on the event.
The showcase, Pax East, will run through March 1 and demo some of the major recent and upcoming game releases before a mass audience at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. With both prominent game publishers and members of the general public, the expected crowd for the event figures to number in the tens of thousands.
"Today, Sony Interactive Entertainment made the decision to cancel its participation at PAX East in Boston this year due to increasing concerns related to COVID-19 (also known as 'novel coronavirus')," the post reads. "We felt this was the safest option as the situation is changing daily. We are disappointed to cancel our participation in this event, but the health and safety of our global workforce is our highest concern."
The news comes after Boston released a statement confirming its first case of coronavirus in the state of Massachusetts.
Sony was preparing to demo some of its most anticipated upcoming releases at the show and is preparing to release a new console, the PlayStation 5, this year.
In a statement to The Washington Post on Wednesday, Pax event director Kyle Marsden-Kish said Pax East will go on as planned, with "enhanced cleaning and sanitization across the show" based on the Environment Protection Agency's recommendations in its emerging pathogen policy. "We are working closely with the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center and following local, state and federal public health guidelines, including those issued by the CDC," Marsden-Kish said in a statement.

2:03 PM: CDC issues 'Level 1' travel warning for Hong Kong
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new travel notice Wednesday for people headed to Hong Kong.
The Level 1 warning asks travelers to exercise basic hygiene that includes hand washing and to avoid contact with sick people. The relatively mild warning comes shortly after Hong Kong reported a second death caused by coronavirus.
Canceling or postponing travel plans wasn't discouraged by the agency. However, the CDC recommended that a person seek medical attention if a visit to Hong Kong happened in the past 14 days and if symptoms of the virus are occurring.
Earlier this month, the agency issued a Level 3 travel notice to China that advised against nonessential travel to the country. Hong Kong, Macao and the self-governing island of Taiwan weren't part of that warning.

1:40 PM: First Diamond Princess crew member to test positive for coronavirus discharged from hospital
A Filipino crew member from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the first among the crew to test positive for the coronavirus earlier this month, was discharged from a Japanese hospital Wednesday, according to a statement from the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs.
He was admitted to a hospital on Feb. 5 and has been "successfully treated," officials said.
About 40 other Filipinos are still receiving medical care for covid-19 at facilities throughout the Tokyo metropolitan area, according to officials. That number includes six new cases that emerged Wednesday, among 79 new cases total on the Diamond Princess.
The Philippines Embassy in Tokyo is working with the Japanese government and Princess Cruises management to coordinate how and when Filipino crew and passengers aboard the cruise ship will be transported back to the Philippines, according to the statement.
Wednesday was the last day of Japan's government-enforced quarantine of the cruise ship. All other Filipino crew members and travelers will be allowed to enter the Philippines once they receive medical clearance, officials said.
At least 621 people have contracted the virus aboard the ship. Crew members say they have not been afforded the same protections as passengers.

1:20 PM: Senators send letter pushing Trump to request emergency funds for coronavirus response
Democratic senators sent a letter Wednesday to the Trump administration asking it to request emergency funding to supplement the government's coronavirus response.
In the letter, 25 senators expressed concern that the administration had not asked for supplemental funding to deal with the epidemic. Trump administration officials, the letter said, "continue to assert that there are already sufficient resources available, while providing few details on current or projected spending."
In a briefing to senators on Feb. 12, administration officials "stated that we must be prepared for a very large and lengthy public health response to this virus given how easily it appears to be transmitted," according to the letter. "They also stated that [the Department of Health and Human Services] would exhaust existing funding for the response soon."
In recent weeks, officials at the state level have expressed concerns over reimbursement for the mounting costs of coronavirus screenings and quarantines, along with staffing and equipment, under federally directed efforts to limit the outbreak's reach in United States.
The letter cites those worries. "We strongly urge the Administration to transmit an emergency supplemental request that ensures it can and will fully reimburse states for the costs," the senators wrote.
The letter also noted that President Trump's recent budget proposal calls for a 9 percent cut in funding for the HHS, which includes the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — although officials said funding aimed at combating the coronavirus would be protected.

12:40 PM: Facebook criticizes Singapore for using anti-fake-news law to shut down a page over coronavirus content
Facebook criticized Singapore for invoking a controversial fake-news law to block a Facebook page, which the government said had been spreading misleading news about the coronavirus outbreak, among other concerns.
Facebook told Reuters on Tuesday that it was legally obligated to comply with Singapore's order this week to block the States Times Review's page in Singapore, but that it was "deeply concerned" by the move.
Singapore last year passed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), one of the world's most far-reaching anti-misinformation laws.
The government had already used it to censor the page in question, which is run by an Australia-based Singaporean political activist. The most recent case concerned articles criticizing Singapore's handling of the coronavirus, which the government said were inaccurate.
"The reason why we need to act swiftly is because if we don't, then these falsehoods can cause anxiety, fear and even panic," Singapore's minister for communications and information, S. Iswaran, told reporters Monday, the Straits Times reported.
Social media companies and governments around the world are grappling with their responses to an onslaught of disinformation around the coronavirus outbreak. Well before the epidemic, however, human rights groups and free speech activists warned that Singapore's fake-news law would restrict freedom of expression.
"We believe orders like this are disproportionate and contradict the government's claim that POFMA would not be used as a censorship tool," Facebook said in a statement, according to Reuters. "We've repeatedly highlighted this law's potential for overreach and we're deeply concerned about the precedent this sets for the stifling of freedom of expression in Singapore."

12:15 PM: Iran reports two coronavirus deaths
Iran's first two coronavirus patients died Wednesday, hours after their infections were initially reported, a spokesman for the country's health ministry wrote on Twitter.
The Iranians died in the holy Shiite city of Qom where they had been hospitalized after testing positive for the virus, Iran's Mehr news agency reported.
Kianush Jahanpur, the health ministry spokesman, wrote that both patients died while in intensive care. The patients were under isolation, Reuters reported.
Iran's deputy minister of health traveled to Qom on Wednesday, according to Mehr, and a team from the ministry's contagious diseases department arrived there Tuesday to assist staff at the Qom University of Medical Sciences, where the patients were hospitalized. Jahanpur told Iranian media earlier Wednesday that a number of people in Qom had been isolated and tested after reporting flu-like symptoms.

11:45 AM: Vaccine efforts are a sign the coronavirus will be around a long time, experts say
This sounds like great news: Drugmakers are starting to develop a coronavirus vaccine.
The downside: That's because they believe the virus is so deadly that developing a vaccine is worth risking a lot of money.
Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson has announced its Janssen unit will partner with the Department of Health and Human Services to work on a vaccine for the rapidly spreading coronavirus.
On Monday, a second drug company — Sanofi Pasteur — said it's also partnering with HHS to work on creating a vaccine using the company's recombinant DNA platform. Both drugmakers will work with HHS's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, otherwise known as BARDA.
"I think companies are looking at it in a way they hadn't looked at it before because I think the disease itself is convincing people this has a potential to be around for a while," said Michael Osterholm, the director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.
Janssen's and Sanofi's announcements are welcome news to government health officials, who have worried publicly that the pharmaceutical industry wouldn't wade into vaccine development because they might never recoup enormous upfront costs — potentially $750 million to $1 billion — for a vaccine that won't be ready until the epidemic has significantly slowed or even ended.

11:15 AM: Taiwan confirms 24th coronavirus case
Taiwan confirmed its 24th coronavirus diagnosis Wednesday, the Taiwanese Centers for Disease Control said in an announcement.
Health officials said the latest patient is a woman in her 60s from the northern part of the island. She went to see doctors four times between Jan. 22 and Jan. 29 for symptoms that included coughing and a fever, authorities said.
The woman's condition worsened to the point that she had to be rushed to the emergency treatment unit of a hospital, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was admitted for care on Jan. 30, but her health declined further. The woman was sent to the intensive care unit, then transferred to an isolation ward where she was diagnosed with coronavirus Wednesday, officials said.
Authorities confirmed that the woman hadn't been abroad for about two years. Health officials said they planned to investigate her contacts and activities over the past two weeks, in an effort to identify where she contracted the infection.

10:30 AM: How exactly does coronavirus kill?
The mounting death toll from the coronavirus raises a basic question: How does the virus make people sick, and why is it fatal for some?
Scientists' understanding of the new coronavirus is in flux, but it's important to keep a few facts in mind: Most people who contract covid-19 — 80 percent, according to a study from Chinese public health officials — will experience only mild illness and recover. Based on early numbers, about 2 percent of people who are infected die — but that estimate comes with a huge caveat, given how hard it is to estimate fatality rates early in an outbreak.
The difference between a lethal infection and one that feels like a bad cold probably hinges on the interaction between the virus and a person's immune system, say researchers, who are relying on their knowledge of other similar illnesses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
"What you get is the initial damage and rush of inflammatory cells, but the damage is so extensive that the body's immune response is completely overwhelmed — which causes even more immune response, more immune cells and more damage," said Matthew Frieman, a University of Maryland virologist.
Coronaviruses that cause common colds are excellent at infecting the upper airway, while the virus causing SARS tended to go deeper in the lungs. As the coronavirus gains strength, Frieman said, dead cells are sloughed off and collect in the airway, making breathing difficult.
In the patients who recover, the immune system's response has worked: It has cleared the virus, with inflammation receding. Yet experts don't know the long-term outcome for these individuals. It's possible they will gain immunity and be protected from reinfection. Or they might get a less severe case in the future — or not be protected at all. They also might just gain temporary immunity. It's yet another unanswered question about the coronavirus.

9:35 AM: North Korea maintains there are no coronavirus cases in the country
SEOUL — North Korea maintained Wednesday that it does not have any coronavirus cases.
"Fortunately, no coronavirus case has been reported in our country to date," Pyongyang's Health Minister Oh Chun Bok told the official Korea Central Television.
"However, if we lower our guard just a little bit and let even one case of coronavirus infection occur, this can escalate into a disastrous fallout," Oh told the state broadcaster.
The World Health Organization said Tuesday that there are "no indications" of coronavirus cases in North Korea.
"At the moment there are no signals. There are no indications we are dealing with any covid-19 there," Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies program, said during a news conference in Geneva.
South Korean media outlets had previously reported on a coronavirus outbreak in North Korea, citing unnamed sources there.
South Korea's Unification Ministry spokesman Yoh Sang-key said Wednesday that the country could consider sending virus aid to North Korea, if asked. The country has yet to receive an official request from an international organization, however, he added.

9:00 AM: Passengers on Westerdam cruise ship in Cambodia test negative for virus
After a health scare last weekend that sent health officials in several countries scrambling, test results now show that almost 800 passengers on a cruise ship docked in Cambodia do not have the coronavirus, Cambodian health officials said.
The cruise ship Westerdam was turned away by several ports in Asia before finally being welcomed by Cambodia. Some of the passengers were allowed to disembark and travel on to other countries because the ship was assumed to be virus-free. But on Feb. 15, one passenger — an 83-year-old American woman from the ship who went on to Malaysia — tested positive, prompting fears that other passengers may be carrying the virus.
On Wednesday, Holland America Line, which operates the Westerdam, said 781 passengers tested negative for the virus that causes the disease now known as covid-19. "This completes the guests' testing," the company said in a statement.

When the ship first left Hong Kong on Feb. 1, it carried 1,455 passengers and 802 crew members. Once it docked in Cambodia, roughly 674 passengers and 55 crew members disembarked and flew onward to other countries, including the United States. The rest were stopped by sudden restrictions on travel imposed as news of the 83-year-old woman's positive test spread, Holland America spokesman Erik Elvejord said in an phone interview.
Since then, the remaining 781 passengers and 747 crew members have been stuck in Cambodia. While some passengers will be allowed to disembark Wednesday, the crew members will remain aboard while they wait for their tests to be completed, Elvejord said.
The 55 crew members who were able to leave previously were not tested, he added, and it is unclear what countries they returned to. Those crew members left because they had finished their contracts, he said.
Experts have cautioned that the Westerdam incident demonstrates how travelers without obvious symptoms could slip through screening processes because authorities have been focused on monitoring only those who traveled to China or had close contact with an infected person.

8:35 AM: Three new coronavirus cases in Singapore, including one originally diagnosed as dengue fever
Singapore confirmed three new coronavirus cases, raising the country's total to 84 infections.
Singapore's Health Ministry linked one of the patients to the Grace Assembly of God Church, which is the country's biggest cluster, and another patient to the Life Church and Missions, Singapore's Straits Times newspaper reported. The third person infected, however, had not recently traveled to China and was originally hospitalized in a shared room, following a dengue fever diagnosis.
The 57-year-old Singaporean woman was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 15 and moved to an isolation room after testing positive for the virus on Feb. 18. The Health Ministry said in a statement Wednesday that authorities are tracing and monitoring anyone that this third patient could have come in contact with.

"They [other patients] have been tested for covid-19 infection, and the results are pending," the ministry said. "So far, none of the contacts have any respiratory symptoms."
Singapore's Ministry of Health also announced Wednesday that 34 coronavirus patients have been discharged. Of the 50 people who remain hospitalized, most are in stable or improving condition, although four are in a critical state in the intensive care unit, according to the ministry.

8:10 AM: Scientists and WHO rebuke coronavirus conspiracy theories
Dozens of scientists joined the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday in rebuking conspiracy theories on the origins of the coronavirus.
"The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened by rumours and misinformation around its origins," read an open letter published in the Lancet medical journal and signed by more than 20 scientists. "We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that covid-19 does not have a natural origin," they wrote.
"Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus," the authors added.
The letter was published as WHO representatives similarly rebuked conspiracy theories that the virus may not have natural origins. At a news conference on Wednesday, Richard Brennan, a regional emergency director with the WHO, said there is "no evidence that this virus was produced in a laboratory, and certainly no evidence that it was produced as a biological weapon."
"This is one of the rumors that we need to snuff out very, very early," he said, adding that the WHO is working proactively to debunk conspiracy theories via its digital channels.

7:33 AM: Chinese citizens with HIV could run out of treatment within days, UNAIDS warns
A significant number of Chinese living with HIV are at risk of running out of medicines within days, warned the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS.
The problem, said the organization, known as UNAIDS, is largely due to "lockdowns and restrictions on movement in some places in China" in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
In a survey conducted by UNAIDS and its regional partners earlier this month, almost one-third of more than 1,000 Chinese respondents with HIV said they feared being left without treatment in the next days.
"People living with HIV must continue to get the HIV medicines they need to keep them alive," Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS, was quoted as saying in a release Wednesday.

The program vowed to address the distribution difficulties through "a close partnership between the [Chinese] government and community partners." The program's China branch also said it would proactively seek to reach individuals at risk of running out of medicines.
Separately, the "Chinese National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention has directed local authorities to ensure that nonresident people living with HIV can collect their medication wherever they are and has published and disseminated lists of antiretroviral therapy clinics," UNAIDS added.

7:07 AM: Iranian authorities report first two confirmed coronavirus cases
ISTANBUL — Iranian authorities have confirmed two cases of the coronavirus, the country's first known infections, local media reported Wednesday.
Kianush Jahanpur, a Health Ministry official, said the cases were detected in the holy city of Qom and that a number of other people with flu-like symptoms have been isolated and are undergoing testing, according to the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA).
Jahanpur did not divulge the nationalities of those infected or elaborate on the number of people suspected of having the virus. He said that specialized medical teams were deployed to Qom to detect potential cases of the virus, which first emerged in China in December.
"In the past two days, suspicious cases of influenza were detected in the city of Qom," Jahanpur said, ISNA reported.
"Initial testing showed two positive cases for coronavirus, while some other [patients] were reported to have Type B influenza," he said, adding that further testing was being conducted.
Earlier this month, Iran evacuated more than 50 Iranian nationals — as well as Iraqi, Lebanese and Syrian nationals — from the Chinese city of Wuhan where the outbreak of the virus originated. The evacuees were flown to Tehran and quarantined for two weeks, according to local media reports.
The report came just hours after WHO officials in Cairo noted that no new countries have been added to the list of those affected in a few days.

6:06 AM: WHO details efforts to step up virus preparedness in North Africa and the Middle East
The World Health Organization (WHO) said Wednesday that it was working to increase preparedness in North Africa and the Middle East for a possible outbreak of the coronavirus, promising the delivery of more essential medical supplies.
The organization detailed its strategy in the region in a news conference in Cairo on Wednesday, one day after the United Nations secretary general warned that one of his biggest concerns was the possible spread of the coronavirus to countries with "less capacity in their health service."
Egypt recently reported its first case of the virus, amid mounting concerns that it could spread in other parts of Africa, which analysts have cautioned are ill-equipped to handle an outbreak. More than 1 million Chinese citizens are estimated to work in Africa.
Speaking in Cairo on Wednesday, Richard Brennan, a regional emergency director with the WHO, said laboratories in 20 out of 22 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region are now capable of diagnosing the virus. Speeding up tests has been considered crucial in quickly confirming cases and identifying other individuals who were potentially exposed to the virus.
Brennan also said the WHO was distributing essential supplies, including gloves, masks, medical gowns and respirators.
"There has been a tendency for some countries to start hoarding some of these materials, these essential supplies," he said. "But we've got to make sure that the supplies get to people who need them. So, WHO is working with the manufacturers [and] with governments to make sure that supplies are freed up and appropriately and fairly distributed across the globe in the spirit of solidarity."
Brennan added that while there have been encouraging trends of decreasing numbers of new cases around the world, "we have to be vigilant, we cannot be complacent." He said the WHO would continue working on preparedness around the region.
"We are not at a turning point yet," he added.

5:30 AM: Chinese issue stricter virus detection guidelines — numbers could now drop
BEIJING — Chinese national health authorities have released stricter guidelines for how coronavirus cases are diagnosed, which could decrease the rate of new cases in the outbreak's epicenter.
In the sixth edition of its diagnostic criteria released Wednesday for covid-19, as the disease is called, the National Health Commission eliminated the distinction between how cases would be classified in Hubei province and other regions. Cases will now be reported under two categories: "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," the document said.
Moving forward, cases can only be described as "confirmed" if they stem from a positive result in a nucleic acid test.

Hubei officials surprised the world last week when they loosened their diagnosis criteria and began classifying as "confirmed" cases that were only clinically diagnosed by physicians. The move, which was not followed by other provinces, led to a dramatic surge in newly reported cases in Hubei to 10 times the previous rate. Chinese officials said the change was necessary due to the prevalence of undercounting inside the virus-ridden province.
It's unclear if the new guidelines will now lead to an equally dramatic drop in new cases.
The prevalence of coronavirus patients showing mild or no symptoms has been a challenge for public health authorities worldwide, who say it is difficult to screen for carriers.
Experts, including top Chinese scientists, have called into question the accuracy of the nucleic acid tests, which examine genetic material from swabs of the mouth and throat. State media have also reported that case counting inside Hubei has been bottlenecked by the limited number of labs that can process samples.
A team led by top Chinese pulmonologist Zhong Nanshan said this week that he has been developing an antibody test that should give conclusive results more quickly and accurately.

5:26 AM: Passengers begin disembarking from Diamond Princess as 79 more cases discovered
TOKYO — Hundreds of passengers who have tested negative for the new coronavirus began disembarking from the Diamond Princess cruise ship Wednesday as the 14-day quarantine ended, even as another 79 people from the ship have been found to have the virus.
The latest figures from the Japanese Health Ministry bring to 621 the number of people on board the ship who have the virus, according to Japanese media. Those testing positive will be taken to isolation facilities or hospitals depending on their level of symptoms, while those who have tested negative are finally being freed.
People whose travel companion contracted the virus have been asked to serve out an additional 14-days quarantine, starting from the date at which their cabin mate was removed from the ship.

At around noon, people wearing masks and carrying their suitcases began descending from the boat one after another, some walking alone and some in pairs between cones toward a fleet of buses waiting to take them to a nearby station in the Japanese city of Yokohama, just outside Tokyo.
"When I learned that they decided to disembark us, I really could not help but cry with joy," an elderly man told reporters as he was descending from the bus, according to a video posted on the NHK website. "I just wanted to get out as soon as possible."
Many people described how their worries had grown as more and more people on board the ship tested positive for the virus and were taken away to hospitals.
"It was tiring, but I am so relieved now," said a 77-year-old man who was traveling with his 70-year-old wife, according to Yomiuri Shimbun.
The disembarking of the passengers is expected to continue through Friday.

5:08 AM: New research paper indicates Chinese authorities underreported virus cases at outbreak onset
BEIJING — A new paper by researchers at China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that more than 100 people in China had been infected with the novel coronavirus by the end of 2019, suggesting the possibility of underreporting by health authorities or mishandled responses by local governments in the early days of the outbreak.
The paper, published by Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, revealed for the first time that 104 people had already showed coronavirus pneumonia symptoms as of Dec. 31, 2019, and that 15 of them later died. The epidemiologists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed 72,314 patient records nationwide as of Feb. 11 — both confirmed and suspected cases — and found that more than 5,000 of them had been put under medical observation as early as last December.

The new finding contrasts with official accounts from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, which confirmed on Jan. 3 only 44 infections and reported no deaths, saying that 121 people who had come into contact with those confirmed patients were under medical observation. It went on to say that only half of the people with those early infections had visited the Huanan Seafood Market, a popular market associated with sales of exotic game meat and widely believed to be the origin of the ongoing outbreak.
After Jan. 1, the rate of new infections associated with the seafood market had dropped to 8.6 percent, as the epidemic started to explode through community transmission, the paper said. Through retrospective analysis, the authors pointed out that by Jan. 10, the virus had spread to 20 out of 31 provinces, regions and municipalities. However, China's National Health Commission did not announce the first infection outside Hubei — a case in Guangdong province — until Jan. 19.

3:50 AM: Chinese cities coming back to life as confidence builds that outbreak is under control
BEIJING — Chinese cities are slowly coming back to life as the government gains confidence in its ability to control the epidemic.
Shanghai and a dozen other Chinese cities have allowed office buildings, shopping malls, and restaurants to reopen this week, but with extra measures taken to reduce the risks of virus spread, local media reported Wednesday.
While a number of businesses have encouraged employees to work from home, more and more white-collar workers are tiptoeing back to downtown Shanghai's dense skyscrapers — albeit with some safety measures. The 88-story Jinmao Tower, which houses branch offices of big state banks, IT companies and an upscale Hyatt hotel, have required tenants on different floors to clock in at different hours of the day to reduce mass gathering.
Other buildings have limited the number of passengers for elevators; for instance, the Hongqiao R&F Center allows no more than four people in one ride at the same time, while the HKRI Taikoo Hui commercial complex put the upper limit at six.

The city government said Tuesday that a third of storefronts have also reopened. Smaller restaurants in Shanghai remain closed, and the few that are open have either opted for takeaway only or kept eating-in customers as far apart as possible. The food court in Shanghai Center has kept only a third of its tables and allowed only one customer per table; in addition, tables are placed at least three feet away from each other.
Fast-food chains and coffee shops including KFC and Starbucks are introducing a "no-touch" service, which asks customers to place orders on smartphone apps or a self-service machine and then get their food or drinks at a pickup table away from the cashier.
Some 200 miles away in Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu, major shopping malls and department stores — the Central, Golden Eagle, Cenbest and the House of Fraser — reopened Wednesday morning with temperature checks at entrances, while most offices, cinemas and other indoor venues remain closed. Clinics and outpatient departments at public hospitals also resumed service, but dental clinics and the departments of oral medicine, ophthalmology, otolaryngology and plastic surgery are closed until further notice.
Intercity bus services and subway systems in Suzhou and several other cities in Jiangsu province have returned to normal operation this week. On Tuesday alone, more than 110,000 passengers took the subway in Suzhou, and all of them had to register their personal information before a security check. Parks, gardens and outdoor sports facilities are now open to public, but with security in place to control human flow.
Hangzhou, the home city of e-commerce giant Alibaba, announced Tuesday that roadblocks and temporary checkpoints inside the city would be dismantled. On Wednesday morning, social media was abuzz with excitement because traffic jams were reported in some parts of the city, signaling an increasing number of cars back on the road. The city's West Lake scenic area reopened Wednesday, cutting the daily quota of visitors by half and requiring all to wear masks inside.
Three malls owned by Yintai Group have reopened, requiring temperature checks, real-name registration and closing two hours earlier than normal. By Thursday, all businesses in the services sector will be allowed to reopen.
Malls and wholesale markets in other cities — from Kunming in the west to Yiwu in the east, from Changchun in the north to Sanya in the south — have also reportedly reopened this week.
Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, and the wider Hubei province remain under strict quarantine.

2:20 AM: Philippines to allow some flights from China to bring home citizens
MANILA — Select commercial flights from China to the Philippines will be available despite the travel ban, the Department of Foreign Affairs announced Wednesday.
In a public advisory, the department said Filipinos who wish to return to the Philippines can board flights out of Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Kunming, Shanghai and Xiamen.
All returning Filipinos must undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine.
The Philippines eased its travel ban on China and its special administrative regions on Tuesday, when it allowed overseas Filipino workers, permanent residents and students to return to Hong Kong and Macao.
At least 200,000 Filipinos reside or work in China. Earlier this month, 45 Filipinos were repatriated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.

2:15 AM: Beijing district changes tack on epidemic control
BEIJING — Xicheng district, one of Beijing's most central locales and the site of the Chinese government's central headquarters, is tightening restrictions and increasing tests for more than 489,000 households in one of the most significant changes in epidemic-control policies in the capital.

Sun Shuo, deputy secretary of the district's Communist Party committee, said Tuesday that all residential compounds that have conditions for closed-off management will be locked down, and the government has formulated specific measures for bungalows and compounds without property companies to ensure that "no blind spots are left."
News had been circulating online that a government employee in Xicheng was diagnosed with the coronavirus, leading to the shutdown of government work in the district. Sun confirmed that the unnamed government employee was infected while carrying out epidemic-control work in central China and then drove back to Beijing.
Sixty-nine close contacts and people with high risks have been placed under centralized medical observation, but Sun said government agencies in the district are operating normally.
A total of 393 confirmed cases have been reported in 15 districts in Beijing so far, with 52 from Xicheng.

2:10 AM: Videos surface of Chinese police officers beating people for not wearing masks
BEIJING — Chinese Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi on Tuesday warned police officials and local administrators against excessive and "crude" use of force after a spate of videos surfaced showing officers tackling and roughing up citizens who refuse to wear masks.
Chinese citizens are generally not known to hold urban beat cops, known as chengguan , or an array of semiformal security enforcers, in particularly high esteem. Now, one month into the full-blown epidemic, tempers are running particularly hot as countless Chinese cities and villages live under severe restrictions on movement.
The Chinese Internet has been suffused with online videos showing residents facing off with police. Women have been pinned on the ground for refusing to wear masks. One officer fired his gun after he was swarmed by locals angry about quarantine policies. Local inspectors slapped three people playing mah-jongg, leading to a furious confrontation with pajama-clad players. Brawls sometimes break out.
The latest video to cause a sensation showed a man in Henan province being bound by rope against a pillar outside a building while a man in hazmat suit berated him for not wearing a mask or registering his movement.
After the video surfaced, local Henan officials this week sent a terse reminder to villages that epidemic prevention and control work must be done "in accordance with laws and regulations," according to the Southern Metropolis newspaper.

1:53 AM: Japan whistleblower slams chaotic, scary conditions on Diamond Princess
TOKYO — A Japanese infectious disease specialist has condemned the "chaotic" and "scary" conditions on board the Diamond Princess cruise liner, saying a lack of infection control risked the lives not only of the passengers and crew but also of the officials and medical staff working on the ship.
Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University said he had gained access to the ship Tuesday and was appalled by a "completely inadequate system of infection control on board."
After several hours trying offer constructive advice on how to improve procedure, he was thrown off the ship, but was so worried he recorded YouTube videos in Japanese and English exposing his findings. The Japanese version has already been viewed more than 710,000 times.
Iwata said he had worked in Africa during the Ebola outbreak, in China during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, as well as during cholera outbreaks.
"I never had fear of getting infection myself, for Ebola, SARS, cholera, because I know how to protect myself, how to protect others and how infection control should be," he said. "But inside the Diamond Princess, I was so scared."
Already 542 people on the cruise ship have been found to have the virus, out of 2,404 people tested, with results still awaited on the final 1,300 tests.
Four people working on or around the ship during the quarantine period have also contracted the virus, including a quarantine officer, a Health Ministry official, an ambulance driver and a medical staffer.
Normal infection control involves establishing a red zone, where the virus is present and protective gear must be worn, and a green zone, which is safe, Iwata said. There was no such demarcation on board the ship, with people wearing protective suits mingling with and eating alongside unprotected people, and people even eating food and handling smartphones without removing gloves and clothing that could carry the virus.
"It was completely chaotic," he said. "I was so scared of getting covid-19 because there was no way to tell where the virus is, no green zone, no red zone — everywhere could have the virus."
Iwata said "bureaucrats were in charge of everything" without a single professional infection control specialist on board. When a crew member went to a nurse with a fever, the nurse didn't even bother protecting herself, because she had concluded she must have already caught the virus, he said.
He has since returned to his home in Kobe, but has isolated himself in a room for fear of infecting his family, and will not return to work for around two weeks for fear of infecting colleagues and patients. But he said he feared doctors and nurses working on board will return to medical centers around the country with the virus, and could infect patients.
Responding to Iwata's complaints, Japan's chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the government had been "implementing measures to prevent the spread of the infection thoroughly."

1:03 AM: South Korea reports sharp rise in cases, mostly linked to a church
SEOUL — South Korea confirmed 15 new cases of the new coronavirus infection on Wednesday, raising the national tally to 46.
Of the new cases, 13 were in Daegu city and the surrounding southwestern province of North Gyeongsang, with 11 of them linked to a previously confirmed patient, according to Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
The 61-year-old woman is believed to have infected 10 people who attended the same church, and one person who came in contact at her hospital.
She started displaying symptoms of fever around Feb. 10 and tested positive for the virus on Tuesday, according to the KCDC.
The agency has identified 166 people who came in contact with the woman, who are now in quarantine at home or in hospitals. It said it would conduct a close inspection of the church and test more churchgoers for the virus.

12:25 AM: Six more Filipino crew members on Diamond Princess test positive for coronavirus
MANILA — There are now 41 Filipino crew members on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship infected with the novel coronavirus, health officials said Wednesday, an increase of six from a day earlier.
The patients have been brought to hospitals in Japan, where the ship is moored, and will be unable to return to the Philippines even as the government aims to repatriate other Filipinos this week.

Only those who are asymptomatic and who tested negative for the virus will be allowed to board a flight. They will still be subject to a 14-day quarantine.
The repatriation team will also be kept in isolation for the same period. Officials said the quarantine facility and other details are still being finalized.
There are a total of 538 Filipino crew members on the cruise liner.
The global outbreak has affected the Philippines' 2 million-strong overseas workforce, resulting in panic and job uncertainty. At least two Filipinos in Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates have tested positive for the virus.

12:01 AM: Hong Kong reports second death from virus outbreak
HONG KONG — A 70-year-old man has died after testing positive for coronavirus, according to a Hong Kong hospital, bringing city's death toll from the outbreak to two.
A spokeswoman for Princess Margaret Hospital said the patient died on Wednesday morning after his condition deteriorated. When health officials initially provided details on his case on Friday, they said he had underlying illnesses. He was sent to the hospital on Feb. 12 after developing malaise, shortness of breath and cough, the Center for Health Protection said, where he was in critical condition at the time. The man, who lives alone, had visited mainland China for a day trip on Jan. 22.
As of Wednesday morning, Hong Kong reported 62 cases of coronavirus infection, including the two deaths. The first death, a 39-year-old man who contracted the virus outside of the city, also had underlying medical issues, health officials said.

Full text: China reported a moderate jump in coronavirus cases Saturday after a two-day surge that arose from Hubei province changing its method of counting diagnoses. The swell of cases had dented hopes that the deadly outbreak could be petering out.
With an additional 2,600 reported Saturday, the number of cases in mainland China has surged past 66,000, and the economic fallout is mounting. The latest casualties are flower sellers in the country, some of whom have seen their sales fall up to 95 percent on Valentine's Day.
More places in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, are enacting "wartime" measures, such as sealing off residential complexes and allowing only essential vehicles on the roads. Authorities in Yunmeng county, where the new steps kicked in Friday morning, said that anyone attempting to breach the lockdown "at compounds, buildings or road connections" would be detained.
Here are the latest developments:
● Beijing announced a new rule requiring all residents returning to the city to self-quarantine for 14 days and warned that those who refused would be punished.
● A Japanese man who was recently diagnosed with coronavirus traveled to Hawaii from Jan. 28 through Feb. 7 and developed "cold-like symptoms" while he was there, state officials said.
● Japan has said that 10 people evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are in serious condition, as the cruise industry braces for serious losses over coronavirus fears.
● China's National Health Commission said more than 1,700 medical workers have been infected with coronavirus, six of whom have died, citing the latest available figures as of Tuesday.
● Egypt announced its first case of coronavirus Friday, marking the first confirmed instance of the virus in Africa.

8:50 PM: Japanese coronavirus patient was recently in Hawaii, officials say
A Japanese man who was recently diagnosed with covid-19 traveled to the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Oahu from Jan. 28 through Feb. 7, state officials said Friday.
The man was asymptomatic while on Maui and developed "cold-like symptoms" but no fever while on Oahu, the state's health director, Bruce Anderson, told reporters. When he returned to Japan's Aichi prefecture, the man developed more serious symptoms and sought medical care.
Officials said the man stayed at the Grand Waikikian by Hilton Grand Vacations in Hono­lulu while traveling with his wife.
State Epidemiologist Sarah Park said she did not know the man's flight information but was aware that he wore a medical mask while in transit, which can limit the spread of the disease. The man probably contracted the virus while in Japan or while traveling to Hawaii, Park said.
Officials are trying to identify people who may have come into close contact with the man while he was in Hawaii. Park said she was less focused on people who may have passed him in a hallway or had other fleeting contact.
"What should be reassuring is the person was asymptomatic while in Maui and had only respiratory symptoms — cold-like symptoms and no fever — while in Oahu," Park said. "That's somewhat reassuring to us because we know that when you have the fever you're probably more likely to be more infectious."

7:40 PM: More than 2,600 new cases reported in China
Chinese health officials on Saturday morning reported 2,641 new coronavirus cases and 143 additional deaths nationwide, a sharp decline from Friday's increase of roughly 5,000 cases.
Saturday's figures include three new cases in Hong Kong, where one person has died since the outbreak began. The other deaths outside of mainland China have been one in the Philippines and one in Japan.
More than 66,400 cases have been confirmed in China during the outbreak. Roughly 1,500 people have died.

6:30 PM: Hubei province reports 2,420 new cases and 139 new deaths
Hubei province on Saturday morning reported 2,420 new cases of the virus, most of which were in the city of Wuhan. There were also 139 new deaths.
About half of the new cases were clinically diagnosed by a doctor, as opposed to confirmed by laboratory testing. Hubei's recent expansion of diagnosis criteria has caused case numbers in the province to skyrocket this week.
Since the outbreak began last month, Hubei has accumulated more than 54,400 cases of the coronavirus and 1,457 deaths, according to the province's health officials.

5:45 PM: What's behind the 'infodemic' of false coronavirus news?
The World Health Organization has a term for the onslaught of inaccuracy that has sprung up around the coronavirus: "infodemic," or an epidemic of false information. Rumors have included wildly inflated death tolls, a connection between the coronavirus and bioweapons, and the notion that people eating bats caused the outbreak
On Thursday, representatives from the WHO visited Silicon Valley to discuss with tech companies how to better combat the spread of false information about the coronavirus online. Facebook and other major social media companies have partnered with the WHO to direct users searching for news about the virus to the WHO and other health organizations.
It's not clear whether governments are behind some of the false information, but patterns have emerged that echo those found in government-backed disinformation campaigns, experts told The Washington Post's Kim Bellware on the Post Reports podcast Thursday.
"It's not that they necessarily want to misinform us about the coronavirus in particular, but its rather that the coronavirus offers a ready vehicle for spreading disinformation and reducing the quality of information that we see on the internet," said Carl T. Bergstrom, a researcher at the University of Washington. "When you sow that kind of chaos, it really undermines people's faith in institutions … and that can be really effective for certain hostile governments who want to undermine the stability of a rival country."
People are susceptible to false information about the virus because much remains unknown.
"When that certainty isn't there, we latch on to people who offer us promises of certainty," Bergstrom said.
Some of the false news has had racist and xenophobic elements that target Chinese and other Asian people, Bellware said on Post Reports: "Certain types of misinformation seem to have the end goal of getting people, perhaps in the U.S. or in other countries outside of China, to say, 'Let's keep all Chinese people out of our country. Let's close our borders, round them up. Let's keep them separate.' "

4:50 PM: Canada confirms eighth case of the coronavirus
TORONTO — An eighth person in Canada has tested positive for covid-19, Canadian public health officials said Friday.
The woman, who is in her 30s, lives in the interior of British Columbia. She flew to Vancouver from Shanghai in the past week and traveled home by car.
Bonnie Henry, British Columbia's health officer, said the woman was wearing a mask on the flight and is in isolation at home, where she is in "good" condition.
Officials said they plan to ask all passengers who sat within three rows of the woman on the plane to monitor themselves for symptoms. Henry said she would not provide details about when the new patient arrived in Canada or on what flight.
Canadians' risk of contracting the virus is "still very, very low," Henry said.

4:20 PM: Trump thanks Cambodia for accepting Westerdam cruise ship
President Trump tweeted his thanks to Cambodia on Friday after the country accepted a Holland America cruise liner that for days had been seeking a place to dock.
The MS Westerdam had meandered through the South China Sea as four countries turned the boat away over fears of covid-19. The rising number of infections on another ship, the Diamond Princess, has made governments fearful that other cruise liners could be carrying the virus.
"Thank you to the beautiful country of Cambodia for accepting the @CarnivalCruise ship Westerdam into your port," Trump tweeted, tagging Holland America's parent company, Carnival. "The United States will remember your courtesy!"
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, has also praised Cambodia since the country agreed to accept the Westerdam.
"#Cambodia has demonstrated real solidarity in support of the #COVID19 response," he wrote on Twitter. "We hope all countries and leaders will follow their lead. Together, for a safer world."
Cambodian health officials announced late Thursday that all 20 passengers on the ship had tested negative for the coronavirus. Passengers began to disembark early Friday.

2:58 PM: CDC is using flu labs in 5 cities to test for spread of coronavirus
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week began using five public health labs that usually test for influenza to also start testing for coronavirus in the United States this week. The labs are in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle.
The public health labs are part of the CDC's existing flu surveillance network, which monitors influenza illnesses and hospitalizations. Specimens that test negative for flu will be tested for coronavirus, said Nancy Messonnier, who is leading the coronavirus response at the CDC. Officials plan to expand the testing to more labs in the coming weeks to provide an early warning of where the virus may be spreading.
The United States has 15 confirmed cases, mostly in travelers returning from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. CDC officials say they hope aggressive measures such as quarantines can slow the impact of the disease. But they are also preparing for additional cases. Lab tests confirming more coronavirus cases could allow U.S. officials to take additional actions to prevent spread, such as canceling big social gatherings and boosting the use of telemedicine and telework.
At the same time, flu illnesses have risen sharply in the past few weeks. An extended flu season could add to confusion about whether people are getting sick from the coronavirus or from seasonal flu. Messonnier said there has been an increase in a flu strain that hits children particularly hard. Hospitalization rates for children are as high as they were during the 2017-2018 flu season, one of the worst flu seasons in decades.
This season, at least 26 million people have been sickened by the flu in the United States, including 250,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths.

2:51 PM: Some Asian Americans report facing suspicion and ridicule amid coronavirus outbreak
Dirty looks, deserted restaurants, bullied children — this is the reality for many Asian Americans after the outbreak of the coronavirus six weeks ago.
Although the epicenter of the illness is in China, where tens of thousands have been affected, there had been only 15 cases in the United States as of Thursday. Still, Asians in the country have been subjected to suspicion and ridicule.
Outbreaks often have been attributed to marginalized groups in society, or the "other," experts say. Asian Americans are often still seen as "forever foreigners," no matter the reality of how long they have lived in this country. Time and again, they have been blamed for importing diseases.
Monica Schoch-Spana, a medical anthropologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says other racial and ethnic groups have faced similar scrutiny and discrimination during public health crises.
"What you have over history and throughout modern-day outbreaks is people fixing blame on a contagious disease on outsiders," she said, citing past instances. In 2009, H1N1, or swine flu, was associated with Mexican Americans; in 2003, SARS with Chinese Americans; and in the 1980s, HIV with Haitian Americans. That virus was also called the "the 4H disease," a reference to the "perceived risk factors" of "Haitians, homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and heroin" users.

2:27 PM: In China, epidemic takes much of the romance out of Valentine's Day
Face masks and hazmat suits don't exactly set the scene for romance.
But when Valentine's Day falls in the middle of an epidemic, lovebirds have to make do. For some in China, that has meant finding ways to mark the holiday despite restrictions on movement and restaurant closures. For health workers, it has largely meant sacrificing the special day altogether.

In a video published by the Global Times, the English-language newspaper linked to the ruling Communist Party, health workers described how they were spending the day away from their loved ones to help treat patients who have fallen ill.
Li Tong, who was identified in the video as working at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said his wife also works in the hospital as a nurse. "She is very supportive of me coming to the front line to fight the virus," he said. "I hope she can take good care of the family and protect herself well when working in the hospital. "
"Today is really special because it was the first time we didn't spend Valentine's Day together, but when I think more patients are getting better under my assistance, I think it is totally worth it," he added.
"I'm not an expressive type you know. But I'd like to say to my wife, I love you! Hope to see you soon!"
Then he and his colleague began to clap.
Health workers have faced dangerous conditions throughout the outbreak, with a major uptick in cases among emergency workers reported Friday.

Photos from other major cities showed people in face masks gripping bouquets of flowers. In one photo from an isolation ward in Yangzhou, two health workers completely covered in protective gear held their gloved hands up against a window to make the sign of a heart.
Across China, the virus has taken a devastating toll on businesses that have either closed their doors or experienced a massive drop in customers as travel bans and fears over the spread of the virus have largely confined people to their homes.

2:09 PM: Facebook cancels San Francisco summit because of coronavirus fears
Facebook announced Friday that it would cancel a summit it had planned to hold at San Francisco's Moscone Center in March.
"Out of an abundance of caution, we canceled our Global Marketing Summit due to evolving public health risks related to coronavirus," Anthony Harrison, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement to The Washington Post.
The annual event brings together Facebook employees from around the world. It was due to take place this year from March 9 to 12.
The social media giant is not alone. Earlier in the week, the Mobile World Congress, the world's largest mobile phone summit, was canceled because of travel disruptions. The event had been scheduled to start on Feb. 24.
The cancellations come amid fears that such events could play a major role in proliferating the virus around the world. Attendees at a sales meeting at a hotel in Singapore earlier this month spread the virus to five countries.

1:29 PM: Egypt confirms first coronavirus case in Africa
CAIRO — Egypt's Ministry of Health confirmed Friday that it had detected a case of coronavirus in the country, marking the first known example of the outbreak in Africa.
A spokesperson for the ministry, Khaled Megahed, said in a statement that a foreign national had tested positive for the coronavirus and that the World Health Organization had been notified.
Although the person had not shown symptoms, they were tested due to their travel history. The person was subsequently transported to a hospital and they are now under quarantine. The person's health is stable, Megahed said.
Health officials are taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. A number of people who came into contact with the patient have also been tested for the novel coronavirus, Megahad said.
Though they tested negative, they will be placed under a 14-day quarantine as a precautionary measure. The residence where the person was staying was also being sterilized, Megahad said.
The statement did not say where the person was detected or whether they were a resident of Egypt.

1:15 PM: A look inside Macao's risky coronavirus casino shutdown
MACAO — Visitors arriving in this gaudy Chinese gambling hub are hit with text messages promoting its draw cards: celebrity-chef-branded restaurants and dazzling entertainment shows in one of the dozens of lavish casino resorts.
"Grand Lisboa is looking forward to your visits to our Michelin 3 Stars restaurants!" reads a grammatically imperfect message from the casino complex, whose gold-hued tower was designed to resemble a Brazilian dancer's feathered headdress. "Exclusive accommodation and transportation offers for your choice!"
But no Michelin-starred restaurants were open on a recent visit. Nor were the pastry shops known for Portuguese egg tarts. Luxury stores at several casino resorts The Washington Post visited were shut, too. At the few open shops, bored staff members watched movies on their phones, slept or paced aimlessly. A saleswoman at a Cartier outlet in the Las Vegas Sands-owned Venetian resort said the store had sold nothing in a week. Elsewhere in the complex, empty gondolas were fastened to railings (opera music, however, was still playing).
The two-week shutdown, which seems likely to be extended, is unprecedented. Since its handover from Portugal to China in 1999, Macao has been the only Chinese territory where gambling is allowed. The casinos transformed the fortunes of the city of 670,000, whose tourism sector accounts for 80 percent of economic output and whose 41 casinos employ about one-fifth of the workforce.
"My parents told me this is what Macao looked like before China opened up, when it was quiet, and no one was here," said 30-year-old Teng Fong Mei, who was operating an egg waffle cart that has been her family's business for four decades. Sales have dropped more than 80 percent, she said, as she flipped iron griddles filled with dough.

12:50 PM: Infection of 1,700 front-line workers complicates coronavirus fight
More than 1,700 Chinese medical professionals have been infected with the coronavirus, officials said Friday, a stark reminder of the challenge China faces as it tries to contain the outbreak.
A total of 1,716 Chinese medical workers have been infected as of Feb. 11, accounting for 3.8 percent of the overall confirmed cases, Chinese health authorities said.
The announcement, which was made in the Communist Party-controlled media, confirmed what many already knew: Front-line workers are falling, hurting the ability of an overburdened public health system to respond.
By acknowledging the toll on health professionals, Beijing is trying to signal a level of transparency about the safety on a flash-point issue and letting ordinary people know they share their sense of alarm.
"It might raise a red flag about how serious the situation is," said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, "and hopefully that leads to a more effective government response."
But Huang cautioned against seeing the figure as the final word on medical workers, given discrepancies in case reporting so far.
"If it is coming from an official source, we have to take it always with a grain of salt," he said.

12:35 p.m.: Legal scholars argue coronavirus-related travel bans violate international law
A group of 16 scholars argued that travel bans are an inappropriate response to the coronavirus outbreak, as they violate Article 43 of the International Health Regulations, a binding agreement reached by WHO member states in 2005.
"In imposing travel restrictions against China during the current outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (covid-19), many countries are violating the IHR," the scholars write in an article in the Lancet journal that published Thursday.
While countries "would rather be safe than sorry," evidence "belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer," they add.
"In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us," the authors write. "In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order."
A variety of nations, including the United States, have imposed restrictions on travel to China, especially Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, despite guidance from the WHO to avoid such measures.
The legal scholars were led by Steven J. Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab and a professor at York University in Toronto, and Roojin Habibi, a research fellow with the Global Strategy Lab.
Prominent scholars such as Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, were among the authors.

11:44 AM: WHO says more research needed to know whether patients who recover from novel coronavirus become immune
Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization said Friday that "it's still impossible to know" whether patients who recover from the newly named covid-19 are then immune to becoming sick with it again.
"It's too early to tell what the immunity test would be," Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies program, said at a news conference in Geneva. "It's impossible to know."
Ryan said he expected "that recovered patients would be protected from a further infection," but that it remained unclear how long the immunity would last and whether it would apply to other coronaviruses as well.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19, has now infected and killed more people than severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, another coronavirus that killed around 800 people during an outbreak in 2002-2003. Overall, however, a higher rate of people who contracted SARS died of it compared with those sick with covid-19, whose severity varies more widely. Covid-19 affects the respiratory system and can put people at risk of bacterial infections there, further raising the risk of deadly complications.
Scientists are scrambling to develop a vaccine and anti-viral treatment for covid-19, which can be a costly and time-consuming process.

11:27 AM: African students stuck in Wuhan call on their governments to arrange evacuations
Students from several African countries are stranded in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, after their governments declined to arrange chartered flights for them to leave China.
The BBC reported Friday that the Ugandan government determined it was unable to cover the costs of a flight for the more than 100 students now in the city. In addition, Jane Ruth Aceng, the country's health minister, told lawmakers Thursday that the country was not prepared to treat coronavirus cases. Instead of an evacuation, the government will send about $61,800 to Wuhan to be split among affected Ugandan students, the BBC reported.
"The government has reduced our lives to $61,800," one person wrote on Twitter, using the hashtag #EvacuateUgandansInWuhan. "I can't believe this. Nothing hurts like being Ugandan."
Uganda already quarantined about 100 people who recently landed in the country from China, drawing criticism from some Ugandan students still in China who see it as a double standard that they do not also have the option to return home and self-quarantine.
Ghanaian students based in Wuhan have also expressed their dismay that Ghana will not transfer them home.
Michael Adney, a student leader based in Wuhan, told Ghana's Citi News that students trapped in the city "feel very much disappointed" in the Ghanaian government's response to the crisis.
"They should stop treating us as if we are the virus or are infected," he said.
Some parents of affected students have even offered to pay for their transport if the government helps arrange the flights.
But Badu Sarkodie, public health director of the Ghana Health Service, told the Ghanaian news outlet that for the students to stay in Wuhan is "in their best interest and the best interest of the Ghanaian population."
Last week, Bright Chipao, a Malawian living in Wuhan, told the Guardian that students in his community were growing concerned about how they would get access to basic goods while the city is locked down.
"There is panic among us as we don't know how long we are going to survive," he said. "We are also increasingly running out of foodstuffs."

11:10 AM: Vietnam turns away German cruise ship
Vietnam turned away a cruise liner Friday over fears of coronavirus infection, Vietnamese state media reported, according to Reuters. The ship's company told The Washington Post that there are no coronavirus cases aboard.
Passengers aboard the German-owned AIDAvita cruise ship had been hoping to disembark at the UNESCO world heritage site Ha Long Bay, in Vietnam's Quang Ninh province. Authorities there, however, refused the ship permission to dock Friday, saying it was a cautionary measure as the cruise liner had previously docked in the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, where coronavirus cases have been confirmed.
"Not allowing AIDAvita's passengers to disembark [in Vietnam] is just a temporary solution to prevent the intrusion of diseases," Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported a local official saying, according to Reuters.
There are 16 coronavirus cases in Vietnam, which shares a border with China.
In a statement, AIDA Cruises said the ship had no coronavirus cases.
"There are no suspected or confirmed corona virus infections on board AIDAvita," the company said. "None of our guests or crewmembers have been in China in the last 14 days."
It added, "We are currently examining other options for an alternative route with AIDAvita."
Vietnam has also refused entry to the MS Westerdam cruise liner, which after two weeks at sea searching for a place to dock, made port in Cambodia on Thursday.
The World Health Organization praised Cambodia for allowing in the cruise ship, which also has no confirmed coronavirus cases.
Fears about cruise ships being possible vehicles and incubators for the virus are high after 218 people tested positive the disease now called covid-19 while on the Diamond Princess cruise ship under quarantine off Japan. The number of infections has risen during the quarantine period.

10:50 AM: Beijing asks all residents returning to the city to self-quarantine for 14 days
China's capital is asking residents who were returning to the city to self-quarantine for 14 days after their arrival, the state-run Beijing Daily said Friday.
The measure is among the most stringent taken by the sprawling city in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has resulted in over 370 cases and at least three deaths in the capital.
Beijing Daily reported that those who refused to follow the orders would be punished, without giving further details.

10:25 AM: Inside a coronavirus lab
BALTIMORE — The coronavirus arrived here Feb. 7 in two thumb-size vials, nested in dry ice and multiple layers of protective packaging.
The samples, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, remained in deep freeze until Monday afternoon, when virologist Matthew Frieman at the University of Maryland School of Medicine got clearance from an internal biosafety committee to open the tubes in his secure laboratory and begin experiments.
While the number of cases of the coronavirus continues to grow — to more than 60,000 cases, nearly all in China — the virus is also beginning to multiply in laboratories around the world. A select group of U.S. researchers has received samples of the virus derived from the first U.S. case, a 35-year-old man in Snohomish County, Wash., who recovered. Others have ordered the virus and are waiting.
As the virus rages in China and infectious-disease experts nervously monitor infections that could seed other outbreaks in at least two dozen other countries, it's the scientific work in these laboratories that may lead the way to a therapy or vaccine that could help save lives and fight this outbreak — or the next one. Studying the virus is the first step toward discovering new ways to stop it: by testing potential drugs, developing animal versions of the disease and probing fundamental questions about how it makes people sick.

10:00 AM: Singapore's first health-care worker infected with coronavirus, says he has no idea how he got it
As China announced that the coronavirus has spread significantly among its health-care workers, the first health-care worker known to have become part of the outbreak in Singapore told reporters that he was "just unlucky."
Singapore announced nine new coronavirus cases Friday, including that of a 61-year-old general anesthesiologist. The doctor is case 59 out of 67 total infections and the first health-care professional known to have contracted the coronavirus.
In an interview with Singapore's Straits Times newspaper, the unnamed doctor said Friday that as recently as Feb. 6, he was well and working in the operating theater. After coming down with a fever, he went to a hospital on Sunday and was told he had coronavirus Thursday morning.
He told the newspaper that he had not traveled to China for more than a year and that he had no known interactions with cases of coronavirus.
"I am just unlucky. That's all I can say," he told the Straits Times.
Asked how he could have come into contact with the coronavirus, he said: "I don't know. No idea at all."

9:40 AM: Chinese President Xi calls for health-care reforms
Chinese President Xi Jinping called Friday for improvements in the country's health-care system, citing the need for better medical insurance for major diseases, according to state media.
"Noting that combating coronavirus is a big test for the country's governance system and governance ability, he stressed the need to strengthen areas of weakness and close loopholes exposed by the current epidemic," China Global Television Network reported, paraphrasing Xi.
Friday's statement, and others like it on coronavirus, appeared to be a move by Xi to indicate that China is taking the outbreak seriously, despite criticism that it initially stifled reports of a new virus.
Xi called for other changes in Chinese health laws, signaling that the problem was one of applying policies rather than political reforms, for which his government has suppressed demand.

8:20 AM: Singapore's Catholic archdiocese cancels public masses due to coronavirus fears
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore announced Friday that it was suspending public masses as a cluster of coronavirus infections linked to the Grace Assembly of God church, a non-Catholic congregation, continues to rise.
The temporary ban goes into effect on Saturday. In a statement, the church acknowledged the move was by no means "fool-proof" in containing the virus, but necessary nonetheless.
"As Catholics, we need to be responsible in playing our part to contain the spread of this virus by avoiding large gatherings of people," the archdiocese said in the statement posted to its Facebook page. "Hence, given the current escalating situation which is proving to be difficult to contain, all public Masses, both on weekdays and weekends will be suspended indefinitely."
It will instead broadcast Mass for followers to watch virtually.
"The cancellation of Masses does not mean that Catholics can excuse themselves from fulfilling the obligation of keeping the Day of the Lord holy," the statement continued. "They should try to follow the broadcast of the Mass on YouTube or CatholicSG Radio. … You can also gather as a family for the Liturgy of the Word by spending time in prayer, reading the Word of God of the Sunday Liturgy and interceding for the world that this Covid-19 virus will be contained and eradicated."
On Friday, Singapore announced nine new coronavirus cases, six of which it linked to the Grace Assembly of God church, which has now suspended all services and activities for two weeks, Singapore's the Straits Times reported.

7:50 AM: Philippines walks back travel ban on Taiwanese visitors
MANILA — The Philippines said Friday it would end its controversial travel ban on visitors from Taiwan, which was in effect for less than a week.
"The lifting of travel restrictions for Taiwan has been agreed," said presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo.
The announcement walked back a previous statement Thursday that the ban would remain in place. It came after reports that Taiwan would consider revoking visa-free travel for Filipinos as a result.
The Philippines implemented the ban covering mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao last week. Amid conflicting statements from officials, Manila did not clearly communicate the inclusion of Taiwan until Monday night, resulting in more than 80 Taiwanese people being denied entry to the Philippines and more than 500 stranded across the country.
Panelo said the government would also reevaluate the inclusion in the ban of other jurisdictions, including Macao, after reviewing security protocols meant to contain the virus.
Government agencies cited the "one China" policy as the basis for the inclusion of Taiwan. Critics of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte see the measure as a move to curry favor with China, which views Taiwan as a rogue province.
Taiwan contested its inclusion under the ban, stressing in a statement that it was a "sovereign and independent state" with its own passports. It also said that the World Health Organization's classification of it as part of China was a "factual error."
"No other countries in Asia, except the Philippines, have issued [a] travel ban on Taiwan," the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office said in an earlier statement.

7:40 AM: While coronavirus surges, the Ebola outbreak in Congo finally wanes
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The second-biggest Ebola outbreak in history, which has upended life in eastern Congo's North Kivu and Ituri provinces since August 2018, infecting nearly 3,500 people and killing about 2,250, is down to its last chain of transmission.
Despite ongoing violence that has hampered the response from its outset, and that has spiked again recently, new cases have dwindled. At the virus's height in May, hundreds were contracting the disease every week.
The waning of the Ebola outbreak comes as a new one captures global attention — and, potentially, funding as well. Global health officials have warned that while the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, now known as covid-19, racks up thousands of new cases a day, the hard work of ending the Ebola outbreak and preventing another is far from over.
"Funding needs [for the Ebola response] have not as yet been fully met, and currently there is a risk there will not be funding for WHO activities beyond February," said Margaret Harris, a World Health Organization spokeswoman.
Ebola and covid-19 are vastly different viruses; Ebola can be transmitted only through exchange of bodily fluids, but it killed nearly 70 percent of those who contracted it in eastern Congo.
The WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Thursday that covid-19 "might have adverse consequences for the [Ebola] response efforts through diminishing focus" on it.
While the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a constellation of nonprofits and the Congolese Health Ministry have mounted a relentless campaign to contain Ebola, little has been done to shore up the region's health system, which is sorely lacking in even the most basic infrastructure. Ebola is endemic to Congo's rainforest, and the likelihood of future outbreaks is high.

7:05 AM: Nine new coronavirus cases in Singapore, 6 linked to the same church
Singapore confirmed nine new coronavirus cases Friday, linking six of the patients to a church at the center of the country's biggest cluster of infections.
Thirteen people total with ties to the Grace Assembly of God church have tested positive for the virus since Tuesday. In total, 67 people in Singapore have contracted the illness, known as covid-19, according to Singapore's Ministry of Health.
The Health Ministry's director of medical services, Kenneth Mak, told Singapore's Straits Times newspaper that investigations were still unfolding around the spread of infections connected to the church.
"We have not identified a single individual to be a super spreader," he said.
In Britain, one man who traveled from Singapore to France to Switzerland and then back home to England was later identified as a "superspreader," a term used to describe someone with an outsize role in transmitting an infection. British authorities believe he contracted the coronavirus while in Singapore for a sales conference held at a hotel.

6:20 AM: Hong Kong announces billion-dollar recovery package for industries, groups hit by coronavirus
HONG KONG — The Hong Kong government is hoping to soften the blow of the coronavirus outbreak on its hard-hit sectors, setting aside a multibillion-dollar relief package for tourism-related businesses, restaurants and other vulnerable and affected groups.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced Friday that she will ask the legislative council to approve doubling a fund set aside for the outbreak to $3.2 billion, hoping to use this money to subsidize restaurants, tour operators and other affected industries. The plan calls for direct subsidies to incentivize firms to make surgical masks, as well as financial assistance to the elderly, hawkers and retailers.
Subsidies will also be extended to residents who had been allocated units in two public housing estates earmarked as quarantine sites, Lam added. Each household will receive a single payment of $770.
"We urge all lawmakers to support the funding," she said.
Meanwhile, three new coronavirus cases have been confirmed, bringing the total in Hong Kong to 56.
The city's economic minister said Friday that the government has also requested consent from the Hong Kong Disneyland Park to create more quarantine camps on land originally zoned for the park's expansion, if cases spike.

5:40 AM: International Olympic Committee says no reason to cancel or relocate Tokyo Games
YOKOHAMA, Japan — The International Olympic Committee said Friday it has been advised by the World Health Organization that there was "no case" to cancel or relocate the Tokyo 2020 Olympics over the coronavirus outbreak.

A day after Japan reported its first death from the new coronavirus, John Coates, the head of the IOC's Coordination Commission, said he continued to expect the Games to go ahead as planned.
Advice from the WHO was that "there is no case for any contingency plans of canceling the Games or moving the Games," Coates said, according to Reuters.
The coronavirus epidemic has already caused several international sporting events to be canceled or postponed, including the Shanghai Grand Prix, while Olympic qualifying events in soccer, badminton and basketball had to be moved out of China.
Coates said coordination between the Japan organizing committee's virus task force and other national authorities reinforced the IOC's confidence that the situation was being properly addressed, Reuters reported.
That raised expectations that "we'll be able to ensure that the Games go ahead in a way that's safe for the athletes and spectators," Coates told a news conference in Tokyo.
Toshiro Muto, the chief executive of the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee, said last week he was "seriously worried" that the virus might affect momentum toward the Games, but he pledged the following day the event would go ahead as planned

5:10 AM: Thailand weighs visa-free policy for Chinese travelers — but only after coronavirus eases
Thailand's tourism officials are pushing for visa-free entry for Chinese citizens, the Bangkok Post reported, hoping to kick-start a tourism sector that is suffering heavy losses over the coronavirus outbreak.

Tourism and Sports Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, quoted in the report, said the number of Chinese tourists arriving in Thailand fell about 87 percent in the first nine days of February compared with a year earlier and is likely to drop about 90 percent overall this month. International tourist arrivals overall have dropped by about 43 percent, he added.
Thailand's government is now eyeing a revival in April, hoping that infections will level off by then and that Chinese authorities will lift a travel ban by late March. Tourism officials hope to submit the visa-free proposal for Chinese tourists in April, on the condition that the outbreak is managed and under control.
Southeast Asia is reeling from the loss of billions of dollars in tourism receipts from mainland Chinese arrivals, who cannot come because of the lockdowns in place across a swath of China and travel restrictions imposed by individual countries. In Thailand, the government expects a loss of $8 billion, roughly 1.5 percent of gross domestic product.

4:40 AM: Flower market sees Valentine's Day sales wilt
BEIJING — This season looks grim for the thousands of vendors at China's largest flower trading center, Kunming Dounan market, which sells billions of freshly cut flowers a year and accounts for almost three-quarters of flower transactions in China.
The Dounan market saw its supplies halved and wholesale prices slump by more than 70 percent on Feb. 10, the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year holiday. A manager of Kunming International Flower Auction Exchange Center estimated that Yunnan's flower farmers and vendors stand to lose up to $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020.
"Roses were thrown away in huge piles," a wholesaler, who identified himself only as Hu, told the 21st Century Business Herald on Friday.
A retailer, identified only as Zhang, said traffic-control measures due to the coronavirus outbreak have cut off supplies from some flower-growing villages in Yunnan and hindered the transportation of fresh flowers to other parts of China.
"I only hope I can go back to work as soon as possible," Zhang said, adding that Valentine's Day normally accounts for 20 to 30 percent of annual sales.

4:28 AM: Singapore leader warns of possible recession over coronavirus
Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the coronavirus outbreak has seriously affected the city-state's economy, which could slide into recession over the coming quarters.
Quoting the prime minister on a visit to Singapore's airport, the Straits Times reported that the coronavirus has already hit the economy harder than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which lasted about five months.
"It's already much more than SARS, and the economies of the region are much more interlinked together. China, particularly, is a much bigger factor in the region," Lee said.
Singapore has 58 confirmed cases, among the highest tallies globally. Taiwan, South Korea and others have added Singapore to their lists of travel advisories, urging citizens to refrain from visiting. Singapore. meanwhile, has also barred all arrivals from mainland China to minimize the risk of further outbreaks. The government is bracing for a serious impact on tourism, estimating that arrivals will drop by 25 to 30 percent.
"I can't say whether we will have a recession or not," Lee said, according to the Straits Times. "It's possible, but definitely our economy will take a hit."

3:43 AM: Japan reports another four cases of coronavirus as risk of full-blown outbreak grows
TOKYO — Japan reported another four cases of the new coronavirus Friday, adding to four cases announced the previous day and bringing the national total to 36, as fears rise that the country could be facing its own outbreak of the disease.
One of the most worrying cases announced Thursday was a doctor in the eastern prefecture of Wakayama. On Feb. 7, a former patient at the hospital, a male farmer in his 70s, was found to have the virus. One other doctor and one other patient were also showing some pneumonia-like symptoms and awaiting test results.
A case was also confirmed in the southwestern island of Okinawa, the last port of call of the cruise ship Diamond Princess before it was placed in quarantine in Yokohama last week. A female taxi driver in her 60s found to have the virus was among 200 people who had been under monitoring in Okinawa because they had been in contact with passengers from then ship during their 9.5-hour stay.

The other two cases were found in Tokyo, both in people believed to have been in contact with a taxi driver diagnosed with the virus on Thursday, Japanese media reported. The driver said he had carried Chinese passengers.
Japan's government vowed to step up testing for the virus on Friday, but Health Minister Katsunobu Kato tried to play down concerns.
"We do not have sufficient evidence to change our current position that the outbreak is not widespread," he said, according to broadcaster NHK. "Yet we cannot deny it has spread. We are preparing for that situation so we would be ready if we get into that situation."
Masahiro Kami, executive director at the Medical Governance Research Institute in Tokyo, said the fight against the virus is entering a new phase in Japan.
"The public has now come to be aware that an outbreak is spreading within Japan," he said.
Kami said the virus had already been spreading undetected for some time — evidenced by the fact that a Thai couple were found to have the virus after returning from a visit to Japan. He added that the case of the doctor in Wakayama was a potentially serious problem.
"Doctors and other medical staff, if they get infected, have a possibility that they may transmit the infection to patients where they are hospitalized," he said. "And these are the people who are most vulnerable to the risk of death. This is an issue to which we have to give the highest attention now."

2:45 AM: Vietnam considers 'highest penalty' for factory making masks from toilet paper
Authorities have found a factory in Hanoi using toilet paper to produce face masks, the Vietnam Express reported, cutting corners as coronavirus fears fuel rising demand for supplies of protective items.
Officials this week were suspicious when they found dozens of large toilet paper rolls at the factory, the outlet reported, and discovered that they were being used to replace the inner antibacterial layer that stops microbes from entering or exiting the surgical mask.

"This company is cheating consumers amid the novel coronavirus outbreak," said Hoang Dai Nghia from the Hanoi Market Surveillance Department. The company's stock has been confiscated, and authorities are now considering appropriate penalties.
According to the Vietnam Express, the company, Viet Han Company, is not listed as a medical equipment producer, but as a printer and napkin maker.
The World Health Organization has warned of a global shortage of surgical masks as customers, particularly in Asia, rush to protect themselves against the spread of the virus. Many factories are now trying to pivot and produce these items, but counterfeits have also flooded the market, with false trademarks and false details on where the masks originated from.

2:37 AM: More than 1,700 medical workers in China infected with virus
BEIJING — China's National Health Commission said Friday that at least 1,716 medical staff have contracted coronavirus, and six have died.
Zeng Yixin, the vice director of the National Health Commission, was citing the latest figures available as of Tuesday. Of these cases, 1,502 were reported in Hubei province. The health commission said that the illness will be identified as an occupation injury for medical workers, who will be covered by insurance.
The most sensitive of these cases is the death of Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor who is considered the first to sound the alarm about the new virus when he leaked a document on Dec. 30 from his hospital, confirming the diagnosis. When he succumbed from the disease, grief and rage filled social media, as the country saw his death as a parable for the Communist Party's failings.

2:10 AM: Chinese cities turn to apps, facial-recognition technology to police coronavirus
BEIJING — Chinese authorities in Nanjing have asked residents in the city of 8 million and returning workers to register their personal information on an app, as officials turn away travelers and other short-term visitors.
In a notice issued late Thursday, the Nanjing city government asked returning residents and migrant workers based there to register on an app called "Ning Guilai" — a pun that can either mean Nanjing Returns or Peace Returns. The app requires a facial scan to confirm that all identification information is accurate.
"Your travel could be affected if we find the information you filled in to be inaccurate; more importantly, it will leave a dark spot in your personal credit record," the Nanjing government's notice read, also warning of potential "legal liabilities."
The app also specified that only those with a permanent residence and workplace in Nanjing, and who are not from the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei province, are free to travel into the city. Short-term visitors and travelers without a permanent residence or long-term job in Nanjing must postpone trips there, the city government said.
Shanghai has similarly relied on apps to track arrivals, announcing on Feb. 1 that visitors coming in from airports, train stations and toll gates would have to register their personal information on a smartphone app called Healthcare Cloud. The app was originally designed for making hospital appointments and other health services, but now includes a separate section that requires users to register their detailed personal information, including their ID, home and Shanghai addresses, phone number, emergency contact and travel itinerary.
Yunnan province this week also launched a WeChat in-app program, Kang Yiqing or "Fighting the Epidemic," that requires residents to register their personal information by scanning a QR code when entering a public venue — including residential areas, farmers markets, shopping malls, supermarkets and subway stations.
"For those who refuse to cooperate, public venue management has the right to ban them from entering or exiting. Those who try to force into public venues without registration, disturb public order, or cause serious consequences, will be held accountable according to law," Yunnan authorities said.

1:50 AM: Japan says 10 people evacuated from the Diamond Princess in serious condition
YOKOHAMA, Japan — Japan's health ministry said on Friday that 10 people evacuated from the quarantined cruise ship the Diamond Princess are in serious condition, with eight confirmed to have the new coronavirus.
One of the other two is still awaiting results of a test.

Amid persistent criticism of its approach, the government said it would start allowing some people who have tested negative for the virus to disembark from the ship early, and finish their quarantine at a facility on land. Priority will be given to passengers over the age of 80 and those with existing medical problems, as well as people in windowless cabins, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said.
So far, 218 people on board the ship have tested positive for the virus, out of 713 people who have been assessed. The government says it plans to step up testing in a bid to examine everyone on board before the quarantine ends on Feb. 19.
A quarantine officer involved in screening passengers for the virus also fell sick, with the health ministry saying he did not follow proper procedures, wiping away sweat with his gloves and reusing a mask he had worn earlier, NHK reported.

1:35 AM: Love in a time of coronavirus: Roses are out, broccoli and hand sanitizer is in
BEIJING — Forget red roses. Broccoli, cauliflower, masks and hand sanitizer are now the way to prove you love your partner this Valentine's Day in China, according to Meituan, the country's largest on-demand services provider.
Flower delivery platforms are reporting a massive drop in online flower sales, as health fears dissuade people from ordering anything online or picking up deliveries. Zhong'ai Flower, an online flower delivery platform based in Wuhan, the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak, reported a sales drop of 90 percent. Ma Yingzi, a flower supplier in Beijing, also estimated a 95 percent drop in flower sales this Valentine's Day.
The new favorites: broccoli and cauliflower. Meituan said roses are no longer its most ordered items on this day of love, while the vegetables instead have become hot items. Broccoli in Chinese contains the word "flower" in its name, making it a popular gift in lieu of actual flowers, with more nutrients to boot.
Others are opting for more practical gifts instead of chocolate. Meituan's sales data show that gift orders still grew by 30 percent on Friday, but the most-searched present options were masks, goggles and disinfectants.

1:30 AM: Super Soaper Soffy, Wipe Up Wilson and Mask Up Mei Mei join Singapore's coronavirus fight
Singapore's education ministry has launched a new song — "Bye Bye Virus" — featuring a cast of virus-fighting superheroes in the hopes of teaching schoolchildren best-practice hygiene measures to fend off the outbreak.
It even comes with a dance.
The lyrics replicate advice that has been doled out by the government in recent weeks, but in rhymes: "Wear a mask if you're falling sick / go see a doctor, don't be so thick." The chorus is simply "coronavirus go away, don't you stay."
The cast of superhero characters, like Mask Up Mei Mei and Wipe Down Wilson, all provide specific tips on mask-wearing and hand-washing, and they remind students to avoid touching their faces.
Experts have praised Singapore's transparency and proactive measures in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. The city-state has 58 confirmed cases, one of the highest of any country, but health experts say it has been more proactive about weeding out confirmed cases and tracking down clusters of infection.
Unlike Hong Kong, which has a similar number of infections and a similar population, Singapore has not closed schools, and lessons have continued largely as usual. Only interschool activities have been canceled. Singapore has been focusing its public education efforts on schools and the young, who are vulnerable to the spread of diseases.

1:23 AM: More counties in Hubei enact 'wartime measures,' barring citizens from leaving home
BEIJING — Hubei's most densely populated county became the latest to implement "wartime measures" to control the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, effectively barring residents from leaving their homes.
The Yunmeng Public Security Bureau said on its official WeChat account that these measures would take effect Friday. All residential complexes have been sealed off and only essential vehicles will be allowed on the roads.
"Anyone who forces their way out of compounds, buildings or road connections will be detained," Yunmeng authorities said.
Neighborhood communities are required to assign staff to help residents buy daily necessities. The county has over 300 confirmed coronavirus infections, and has a population of about half a million people.
The orders will be in place for about two weeks, according to Chinese state media.
Experts have questioned the effectiveness of these lockdowns and the legality of applying "wartime" controls in this public health emergency.

Full text: China reported a moderate jump in coronavirus cases Saturday after a two-day surge that arose from Hubei province changing its method of counting diagnoses. The swell of cases had dented hopes that the deadly outbreak could be petering out.
With an additional 2,600 reported Saturday, the number of cases in mainland China has surged past 66,000, and the economic fallout is mounting. The latest casualties are flower sellers in the country, some of whom have seen their sales fall up to 95 percent on Valentine's Day.
More places in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, are enacting "wartime" measures, such as sealing off residential complexes and allowing only essential vehicles on the roads. Authorities in Yunmeng county, where the new steps kicked in Friday morning, said that anyone attempting to breach the lockdown "at compounds, buildings or road connections" would be detained.
Here are the latest developments:
● Beijing announced a new rule requiring all residents returning to the city to self-quarantine for 14 days and warned that those who refused would be punished.
● A Japanese man who was recently diagnosed with coronavirus traveled to Hawaii from Jan. 28 through Feb. 7 and developed "cold-like symptoms" while he was there, state officials said.
● Japan has said that 10 people evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are in serious condition, as the cruise industry braces for serious losses over coronavirus fears.
● China's National Health Commission said more than 1,700 medical workers have been infected with coronavirus, six of whom have died, citing the latest available figures as of Tuesday.
● Egypt announced its first case of coronavirus Friday, marking the first confirmed instance of the virus in Africa.

8:50 PM: Japanese coronavirus patient was recently in Hawaii, officials say
A Japanese man who was recently diagnosed with covid-19 traveled to the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Oahu from Jan. 28 through Feb. 7, state officials said Friday.
The man was asymptomatic while on Maui and developed "cold-like symptoms" but no fever while on Oahu, the state's health director, Bruce Anderson, told reporters. When he returned to Japan's Aichi prefecture, the man developed more serious symptoms and sought medical care.
Officials said the man stayed at the Grand Waikikian by Hilton Grand Vacations in Hono­lulu while traveling with his wife.
State Epidemiologist Sarah Park said she did not know the man's flight information but was aware that he wore a medical mask while in transit, which can limit the spread of the disease. The man probably contracted the virus while in Japan or while traveling to Hawaii, Park said.
Officials are trying to identify people who may have come into close contact with the man while he was in Hawaii. Park said she was less focused on people who may have passed him in a hallway or had other fleeting contact.
"What should be reassuring is the person was asymptomatic while in Maui and had only respiratory symptoms — cold-like symptoms and no fever — while in Oahu," Park said. "That's somewhat reassuring to us because we know that when you have the fever you're probably more likely to be more infectious."

7:40 PM: More than 2,600 new cases reported in China
Chinese health officials on Saturday morning reported 2,641 new coronavirus cases and 143 additional deaths nationwide, a sharp decline from Friday's increase of roughly 5,000 cases.
Saturday's figures include three new cases in Hong Kong, where one person has died since the outbreak began. The other deaths outside of mainland China have been one in the Philippines and one in Japan.
More than 66,400 cases have been confirmed in China during the outbreak. Roughly 1,500 people have died.

6:30 PM: Hubei province reports 2,420 new cases and 139 new deaths
Hubei province on Saturday morning reported 2,420 new cases of the virus, most of which were in the city of Wuhan. There were also 139 new deaths.
About half of the new cases were clinically diagnosed by a doctor, as opposed to confirmed by laboratory testing. Hubei's recent expansion of diagnosis criteria has caused case numbers in the province to skyrocket this week.
Since the outbreak began last month, Hubei has accumulated more than 54,400 cases of the coronavirus and 1,457 deaths, according to the province's health officials.

5:45 PM: What's behind the 'infodemic' of false coronavirus news?
The World Health Organization has a term for the onslaught of inaccuracy that has sprung up around the coronavirus: "infodemic," or an epidemic of false information. Rumors have included wildly inflated death tolls, a connection between the coronavirus and bioweapons, and the notion that people eating bats caused the outbreak
On Thursday, representatives from the WHO visited Silicon Valley to discuss with tech companies how to better combat the spread of false information about the coronavirus online. Facebook and other major social media companies have partnered with the WHO to direct users searching for news about the virus to the WHO and other health organizations.
It's not clear whether governments are behind some of the false information, but patterns have emerged that echo those found in government-backed disinformation campaigns, experts told The Washington Post's Kim Bellware on the Post Reports podcast Thursday.
"It's not that they necessarily want to misinform us about the coronavirus in particular, but its rather that the coronavirus offers a ready vehicle for spreading disinformation and reducing the quality of information that we see on the internet," said Carl T. Bergstrom, a researcher at the University of Washington. "When you sow that kind of chaos, it really undermines people's faith in institutions … and that can be really effective for certain hostile governments who want to undermine the stability of a rival country."
People are susceptible to false information about the virus because much remains unknown.
"When that certainty isn't there, we latch on to people who offer us promises of certainty," Bergstrom said.
Some of the false news has had racist and xenophobic elements that target Chinese and other Asian people, Bellware said on Post Reports: "Certain types of misinformation seem to have the end goal of getting people, perhaps in the U.S. or in other countries outside of China, to say, 'Let's keep all Chinese people out of our country. Let's close our borders, round them up. Let's keep them separate.' "

4:50 PM: Canada confirms eighth case of the coronavirus
TORONTO — An eighth person in Canada has tested positive for covid-19, Canadian public health officials said Friday.
The woman, who is in her 30s, lives in the interior of British Columbia. She flew to Vancouver from Shanghai in the past week and traveled home by car.
Bonnie Henry, British Columbia's health officer, said the woman was wearing a mask on the flight and is in isolation at home, where she is in "good" condition.
Officials said they plan to ask all passengers who sat within three rows of the woman on the plane to monitor themselves for symptoms. Henry said she would not provide details about when the new patient arrived in Canada or on what flight.
Canadians' risk of contracting the virus is "still very, very low," Henry said.

4:20 PM: Trump thanks Cambodia for accepting Westerdam cruise ship
President Trump tweeted his thanks to Cambodia on Friday after the country accepted a Holland America cruise liner that for days had been seeking a place to dock.
The MS Westerdam had meandered through the South China Sea as four countries turned the boat away over fears of covid-19. The rising number of infections on another ship, the Diamond Princess, has made governments fearful that other cruise liners could be carrying the virus.
"Thank you to the beautiful country of Cambodia for accepting the @CarnivalCruise ship Westerdam into your port," Trump tweeted, tagging Holland America's parent company, Carnival. "The United States will remember your courtesy!"
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, has also praised Cambodia since the country agreed to accept the Westerdam.
"#Cambodia has demonstrated real solidarity in support of the #COVID19 response," he wrote on Twitter. "We hope all countries and leaders will follow their lead. Together, for a safer world."
Cambodian health officials announced late Thursday that all 20 passengers on the ship had tested negative for the coronavirus. Passengers began to disembark early Friday.

2:58 PM: CDC is using flu labs in 5 cities to test for spread of coronavirus
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week began using five public health labs that usually test for influenza to also start testing for coronavirus in the United States this week. The labs are in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle.
The public health labs are part of the CDC's existing flu surveillance network, which monitors influenza illnesses and hospitalizations. Specimens that test negative for flu will be tested for coronavirus, said Nancy Messonnier, who is leading the coronavirus response at the CDC. Officials plan to expand the testing to more labs in the coming weeks to provide an early warning of where the virus may be spreading.
The United States has 15 confirmed cases, mostly in travelers returning from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. CDC officials say they hope aggressive measures such as quarantines can slow the impact of the disease. But they are also preparing for additional cases. Lab tests confirming more coronavirus cases could allow U.S. officials to take additional actions to prevent spread, such as canceling big social gatherings and boosting the use of telemedicine and telework.
At the same time, flu illnesses have risen sharply in the past few weeks. An extended flu season could add to confusion about whether people are getting sick from the coronavirus or from seasonal flu. Messonnier said there has been an increase in a flu strain that hits children particularly hard. Hospitalization rates for children are as high as they were during the 2017-2018 flu season, one of the worst flu seasons in decades.
This season, at least 26 million people have been sickened by the flu in the United States, including 250,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths.

2:51 PM: Some Asian Americans report facing suspicion and ridicule amid coronavirus outbreak
Dirty looks, deserted restaurants, bullied children — this is the reality for many Asian Americans after the outbreak of the coronavirus six weeks ago.
Although the epicenter of the illness is in China, where tens of thousands have been affected, there had been only 15 cases in the United States as of Thursday. Still, Asians in the country have been subjected to suspicion and ridicule.
Outbreaks often have been attributed to marginalized groups in society, or the "other," experts say. Asian Americans are often still seen as "forever foreigners," no matter the reality of how long they have lived in this country. Time and again, they have been blamed for importing diseases.
Monica Schoch-Spana, a medical anthropologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says other racial and ethnic groups have faced similar scrutiny and discrimination during public health crises.
"What you have over history and throughout modern-day outbreaks is people fixing blame on a contagious disease on outsiders," she said, citing past instances. In 2009, H1N1, or swine flu, was associated with Mexican Americans; in 2003, SARS with Chinese Americans; and in the 1980s, HIV with Haitian Americans. That virus was also called the "the 4H disease," a reference to the "perceived risk factors" of "Haitians, homosexuals, hemophiliacs, and heroin" users.

2:27 PM: In China, epidemic takes much of the romance out of Valentine's Day
Face masks and hazmat suits don't exactly set the scene for romance.
But when Valentine's Day falls in the middle of an epidemic, lovebirds have to make do. For some in China, that has meant finding ways to mark the holiday despite restrictions on movement and restaurant closures. For health workers, it has largely meant sacrificing the special day altogether.

In a video published by the Global Times, the English-language newspaper linked to the ruling Communist Party, health workers described how they were spending the day away from their loved ones to help treat patients who have fallen ill.
Li Tong, who was identified in the video as working at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said his wife also works in the hospital as a nurse. "She is very supportive of me coming to the front line to fight the virus," he said. "I hope she can take good care of the family and protect herself well when working in the hospital. "
"Today is really special because it was the first time we didn't spend Valentine's Day together, but when I think more patients are getting better under my assistance, I think it is totally worth it," he added.
"I'm not an expressive type you know. But I'd like to say to my wife, I love you! Hope to see you soon!"
Then he and his colleague began to clap.
Health workers have faced dangerous conditions throughout the outbreak, with a major uptick in cases among emergency workers reported Friday.

Photos from other major cities showed people in face masks gripping bouquets of flowers. In one photo from an isolation ward in Yangzhou, two health workers completely covered in protective gear held their gloved hands up against a window to make the sign of a heart.
Across China, the virus has taken a devastating toll on businesses that have either closed their doors or experienced a massive drop in customers as travel bans and fears over the spread of the virus have largely confined people to their homes.

2:09 PM: Facebook cancels San Francisco summit because of coronavirus fears
Facebook announced Friday that it would cancel a summit it had planned to hold at San Francisco's Moscone Center in March.
"Out of an abundance of caution, we canceled our Global Marketing Summit due to evolving public health risks related to coronavirus," Anthony Harrison, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement to The Washington Post.
The annual event brings together Facebook employees from around the world. It was due to take place this year from March 9 to 12.
The social media giant is not alone. Earlier in the week, the Mobile World Congress, the world's largest mobile phone summit, was canceled because of travel disruptions. The event had been scheduled to start on Feb. 24.
The cancellations come amid fears that such events could play a major role in proliferating the virus around the world. Attendees at a sales meeting at a hotel in Singapore earlier this month spread the virus to five countries.

1:29 PM: Egypt confirms first coronavirus case in Africa
CAIRO — Egypt's Ministry of Health confirmed Friday that it had detected a case of coronavirus in the country, marking the first known example of the outbreak in Africa.
A spokesperson for the ministry, Khaled Megahed, said in a statement that a foreign national had tested positive for the coronavirus and that the World Health Organization had been notified.
Although the person had not shown symptoms, they were tested due to their travel history. The person was subsequently transported to a hospital and they are now under quarantine. The person's health is stable, Megahed said.
Health officials are taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus. A number of people who came into contact with the patient have also been tested for the novel coronavirus, Megahad said.
Though they tested negative, they will be placed under a 14-day quarantine as a precautionary measure. The residence where the person was staying was also being sterilized, Megahad said.
The statement did not say where the person was detected or whether they were a resident of Egypt.

1:15 PM: A look inside Macao's risky coronavirus casino shutdown
MACAO — Visitors arriving in this gaudy Chinese gambling hub are hit with text messages promoting its draw cards: celebrity-chef-branded restaurants and dazzling entertainment shows in one of the dozens of lavish casino resorts.
"Grand Lisboa is looking forward to your visits to our Michelin 3 Stars restaurants!" reads a grammatically imperfect message from the casino complex, whose gold-hued tower was designed to resemble a Brazilian dancer's feathered headdress. "Exclusive accommodation and transportation offers for your choice!"
But no Michelin-starred restaurants were open on a recent visit. Nor were the pastry shops known for Portuguese egg tarts. Luxury stores at several casino resorts The Washington Post visited were shut, too. At the few open shops, bored staff members watched movies on their phones, slept or paced aimlessly. A saleswoman at a Cartier outlet in the Las Vegas Sands-owned Venetian resort said the store had sold nothing in a week. Elsewhere in the complex, empty gondolas were fastened to railings (opera music, however, was still playing).
The two-week shutdown, which seems likely to be extended, is unprecedented. Since its handover from Portugal to China in 1999, Macao has been the only Chinese territory where gambling is allowed. The casinos transformed the fortunes of the city of 670,000, whose tourism sector accounts for 80 percent of economic output and whose 41 casinos employ about one-fifth of the workforce.
"My parents told me this is what Macao looked like before China opened up, when it was quiet, and no one was here," said 30-year-old Teng Fong Mei, who was operating an egg waffle cart that has been her family's business for four decades. Sales have dropped more than 80 percent, she said, as she flipped iron griddles filled with dough.

12:50 PM: Infection of 1,700 front-line workers complicates coronavirus fight
More than 1,700 Chinese medical professionals have been infected with the coronavirus, officials said Friday, a stark reminder of the challenge China faces as it tries to contain the outbreak.
A total of 1,716 Chinese medical workers have been infected as of Feb. 11, accounting for 3.8 percent of the overall confirmed cases, Chinese health authorities said.
The announcement, which was made in the Communist Party-controlled media, confirmed what many already knew: Front-line workers are falling, hurting the ability of an overburdened public health system to respond.
By acknowledging the toll on health professionals, Beijing is trying to signal a level of transparency about the safety on a flash-point issue and letting ordinary people know they share their sense of alarm.
"It might raise a red flag about how serious the situation is," said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, "and hopefully that leads to a more effective government response."
But Huang cautioned against seeing the figure as the final word on medical workers, given discrepancies in case reporting so far.
"If it is coming from an official source, we have to take it always with a grain of salt," he said.

12:35 p.m.: Legal scholars argue coronavirus-related travel bans violate international law
A group of 16 scholars argued that travel bans are an inappropriate response to the coronavirus outbreak, as they violate Article 43 of the International Health Regulations, a binding agreement reached by WHO member states in 2005.
"In imposing travel restrictions against China during the current outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (covid-19), many countries are violating the IHR," the scholars write in an article in the Lancet journal that published Thursday.
While countries "would rather be safe than sorry," evidence "belies the claim that illegal travel restrictions make countries safer," they add.
"In the short term, travel restrictions prevent supplies from getting into affected areas, slow down the international public health response, stigmatise entire populations, and disproportionately harm the most vulnerable among us," the authors write. "In the longer term, countries selecting which international laws to follow encourages other countries to do the same, which in turn undermines the broader rules-based world order."
A variety of nations, including the United States, have imposed restrictions on travel to China, especially Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, despite guidance from the WHO to avoid such measures.
The legal scholars were led by Steven J. Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab and a professor at York University in Toronto, and Roojin Habibi, a research fellow with the Global Strategy Lab.
Prominent scholars such as Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, were among the authors.

11:44 AM: WHO says more research needed to know whether patients who recover from novel coronavirus become immune
Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization said Friday that "it's still impossible to know" whether patients who recover from the newly named covid-19 are then immune to becoming sick with it again.
"It's too early to tell what the immunity test would be," Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies program, said at a news conference in Geneva. "It's impossible to know."
Ryan said he expected "that recovered patients would be protected from a further infection," but that it remained unclear how long the immunity would last and whether it would apply to other coronaviruses as well.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19, has now infected and killed more people than severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, another coronavirus that killed around 800 people during an outbreak in 2002-2003. Overall, however, a higher rate of people who contracted SARS died of it compared with those sick with covid-19, whose severity varies more widely. Covid-19 affects the respiratory system and can put people at risk of bacterial infections there, further raising the risk of deadly complications.
Scientists are scrambling to develop a vaccine and anti-viral treatment for covid-19, which can be a costly and time-consuming process.

11:27 AM: African students stuck in Wuhan call on their governments to arrange evacuations
Students from several African countries are stranded in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, after their governments declined to arrange chartered flights for them to leave China.
The BBC reported Friday that the Ugandan government determined it was unable to cover the costs of a flight for the more than 100 students now in the city. In addition, Jane Ruth Aceng, the country's health minister, told lawmakers Thursday that the country was not prepared to treat coronavirus cases. Instead of an evacuation, the government will send about $61,800 to Wuhan to be split among affected Ugandan students, the BBC reported.
"The government has reduced our lives to $61,800," one person wrote on Twitter, using the hashtag #EvacuateUgandansInWuhan. "I can't believe this. Nothing hurts like being Ugandan."
Uganda already quarantined about 100 people who recently landed in the country from China, drawing criticism from some Ugandan students still in China who see it as a double standard that they do not also have the option to return home and self-quarantine.
Ghanaian students based in Wuhan have also expressed their dismay that Ghana will not transfer them home.
Michael Adney, a student leader based in Wuhan, told Ghana's Citi News that students trapped in the city "feel very much disappointed" in the Ghanaian government's response to the crisis.
"They should stop treating us as if we are the virus or are infected," he said.
Some parents of affected students have even offered to pay for their transport if the government helps arrange the flights.
But Badu Sarkodie, public health director of the Ghana Health Service, told the Ghanaian news outlet that for the students to stay in Wuhan is "in their best interest and the best interest of the Ghanaian population."
Last week, Bright Chipao, a Malawian living in Wuhan, told the Guardian that students in his community were growing concerned about how they would get access to basic goods while the city is locked down.
"There is panic among us as we don't know how long we are going to survive," he said. "We are also increasingly running out of foodstuffs."

11:10 AM: Vietnam turns away German cruise ship
Vietnam turned away a cruise liner Friday over fears of coronavirus infection, Vietnamese state media reported, according to Reuters. The ship's company told The Washington Post that there are no coronavirus cases aboard.
Passengers aboard the German-owned AIDAvita cruise ship had been hoping to disembark at the UNESCO world heritage site Ha Long Bay, in Vietnam's Quang Ninh province. Authorities there, however, refused the ship permission to dock Friday, saying it was a cautionary measure as the cruise liner had previously docked in the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore, where coronavirus cases have been confirmed.
"Not allowing AIDAvita's passengers to disembark [in Vietnam] is just a temporary solution to prevent the intrusion of diseases," Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported a local official saying, according to Reuters.
There are 16 coronavirus cases in Vietnam, which shares a border with China.
In a statement, AIDA Cruises said the ship had no coronavirus cases.
"There are no suspected or confirmed corona virus infections on board AIDAvita," the company said. "None of our guests or crewmembers have been in China in the last 14 days."
It added, "We are currently examining other options for an alternative route with AIDAvita."
Vietnam has also refused entry to the MS Westerdam cruise liner, which after two weeks at sea searching for a place to dock, made port in Cambodia on Thursday.
The World Health Organization praised Cambodia for allowing in the cruise ship, which also has no confirmed coronavirus cases.
Fears about cruise ships being possible vehicles and incubators for the virus are high after 218 people tested positive the disease now called covid-19 while on the Diamond Princess cruise ship under quarantine off Japan. The number of infections has risen during the quarantine period.

10:50 AM: Beijing asks all residents returning to the city to self-quarantine for 14 days
China's capital is asking residents who were returning to the city to self-quarantine for 14 days after their arrival, the state-run Beijing Daily said Friday.
The measure is among the most stringent taken by the sprawling city in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has resulted in over 370 cases and at least three deaths in the capital.
Beijing Daily reported that those who refused to follow the orders would be punished, without giving further details.

10:25 AM: Inside a coronavirus lab
BALTIMORE — The coronavirus arrived here Feb. 7 in two thumb-size vials, nested in dry ice and multiple layers of protective packaging.
The samples, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, remained in deep freeze until Monday afternoon, when virologist Matthew Frieman at the University of Maryland School of Medicine got clearance from an internal biosafety committee to open the tubes in his secure laboratory and begin experiments.
While the number of cases of the coronavirus continues to grow — to more than 60,000 cases, nearly all in China — the virus is also beginning to multiply in laboratories around the world. A select group of U.S. researchers has received samples of the virus derived from the first U.S. case, a 35-year-old man in Snohomish County, Wash., who recovered. Others have ordered the virus and are waiting.
As the virus rages in China and infectious-disease experts nervously monitor infections that could seed other outbreaks in at least two dozen other countries, it's the scientific work in these laboratories that may lead the way to a therapy or vaccine that could help save lives and fight this outbreak — or the next one. Studying the virus is the first step toward discovering new ways to stop it: by testing potential drugs, developing animal versions of the disease and probing fundamental questions about how it makes people sick.

10:00 AM: Singapore's first health-care worker infected with coronavirus, says he has no idea how he got it
As China announced that the coronavirus has spread significantly among its health-care workers, the first health-care worker known to have become part of the outbreak in Singapore told reporters that he was "just unlucky."
Singapore announced nine new coronavirus cases Friday, including that of a 61-year-old general anesthesiologist. The doctor is case 59 out of 67 total infections and the first health-care professional known to have contracted the coronavirus.
In an interview with Singapore's Straits Times newspaper, the unnamed doctor said Friday that as recently as Feb. 6, he was well and working in the operating theater. After coming down with a fever, he went to a hospital on Sunday and was told he had coronavirus Thursday morning.
He told the newspaper that he had not traveled to China for more than a year and that he had no known interactions with cases of coronavirus.
"I am just unlucky. That's all I can say," he told the Straits Times.
Asked how he could have come into contact with the coronavirus, he said: "I don't know. No idea at all."

9:40 AM: Chinese President Xi calls for health-care reforms
Chinese President Xi Jinping called Friday for improvements in the country's health-care system, citing the need for better medical insurance for major diseases, according to state media.
"Noting that combating coronavirus is a big test for the country's governance system and governance ability, he stressed the need to strengthen areas of weakness and close loopholes exposed by the current epidemic," China Global Television Network reported, paraphrasing Xi.
Friday's statement, and others like it on coronavirus, appeared to be a move by Xi to indicate that China is taking the outbreak seriously, despite criticism that it initially stifled reports of a new virus.
Xi called for other changes in Chinese health laws, signaling that the problem was one of applying policies rather than political reforms, for which his government has suppressed demand.

8:20 AM: Singapore's Catholic archdiocese cancels public masses due to coronavirus fears
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore announced Friday that it was suspending public masses as a cluster of coronavirus infections linked to the Grace Assembly of God church, a non-Catholic congregation, continues to rise.
The temporary ban goes into effect on Saturday. In a statement, the church acknowledged the move was by no means "fool-proof" in containing the virus, but necessary nonetheless.
"As Catholics, we need to be responsible in playing our part to contain the spread of this virus by avoiding large gatherings of people," the archdiocese said in the statement posted to its Facebook page. "Hence, given the current escalating situation which is proving to be difficult to contain, all public Masses, both on weekdays and weekends will be suspended indefinitely."
It will instead broadcast Mass for followers to watch virtually.
"The cancellation of Masses does not mean that Catholics can excuse themselves from fulfilling the obligation of keeping the Day of the Lord holy," the statement continued. "They should try to follow the broadcast of the Mass on YouTube or CatholicSG Radio. … You can also gather as a family for the Liturgy of the Word by spending time in prayer, reading the Word of God of the Sunday Liturgy and interceding for the world that this Covid-19 virus will be contained and eradicated."
On Friday, Singapore announced nine new coronavirus cases, six of which it linked to the Grace Assembly of God church, which has now suspended all services and activities for two weeks, Singapore's the Straits Times reported.

7:50 AM: Philippines walks back travel ban on Taiwanese visitors
MANILA — The Philippines said Friday it would end its controversial travel ban on visitors from Taiwan, which was in effect for less than a week.
"The lifting of travel restrictions for Taiwan has been agreed," said presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo.
The announcement walked back a previous statement Thursday that the ban would remain in place. It came after reports that Taiwan would consider revoking visa-free travel for Filipinos as a result.
The Philippines implemented the ban covering mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao last week. Amid conflicting statements from officials, Manila did not clearly communicate the inclusion of Taiwan until Monday night, resulting in more than 80 Taiwanese people being denied entry to the Philippines and more than 500 stranded across the country.
Panelo said the government would also reevaluate the inclusion in the ban of other jurisdictions, including Macao, after reviewing security protocols meant to contain the virus.
Government agencies cited the "one China" policy as the basis for the inclusion of Taiwan. Critics of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte see the measure as a move to curry favor with China, which views Taiwan as a rogue province.
Taiwan contested its inclusion under the ban, stressing in a statement that it was a "sovereign and independent state" with its own passports. It also said that the World Health Organization's classification of it as part of China was a "factual error."
"No other countries in Asia, except the Philippines, have issued [a] travel ban on Taiwan," the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office said in an earlier statement.

7:40 AM: While coronavirus surges, the Ebola outbreak in Congo finally wanes
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The second-biggest Ebola outbreak in history, which has upended life in eastern Congo's North Kivu and Ituri provinces since August 2018, infecting nearly 3,500 people and killing about 2,250, is down to its last chain of transmission.
Despite ongoing violence that has hampered the response from its outset, and that has spiked again recently, new cases have dwindled. At the virus's height in May, hundreds were contracting the disease every week.
The waning of the Ebola outbreak comes as a new one captures global attention — and, potentially, funding as well. Global health officials have warned that while the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, now known as covid-19, racks up thousands of new cases a day, the hard work of ending the Ebola outbreak and preventing another is far from over.
"Funding needs [for the Ebola response] have not as yet been fully met, and currently there is a risk there will not be funding for WHO activities beyond February," said Margaret Harris, a World Health Organization spokeswoman.
Ebola and covid-19 are vastly different viruses; Ebola can be transmitted only through exchange of bodily fluids, but it killed nearly 70 percent of those who contracted it in eastern Congo.
The WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Thursday that covid-19 "might have adverse consequences for the [Ebola] response efforts through diminishing focus" on it.
While the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a constellation of nonprofits and the Congolese Health Ministry have mounted a relentless campaign to contain Ebola, little has been done to shore up the region's health system, which is sorely lacking in even the most basic infrastructure. Ebola is endemic to Congo's rainforest, and the likelihood of future outbreaks is high.

7:05 AM: Nine new coronavirus cases in Singapore, 6 linked to the same church
Singapore confirmed nine new coronavirus cases Friday, linking six of the patients to a church at the center of the country's biggest cluster of infections.
Thirteen people total with ties to the Grace Assembly of God church have tested positive for the virus since Tuesday. In total, 67 people in Singapore have contracted the illness, known as covid-19, according to Singapore's Ministry of Health.
The Health Ministry's director of medical services, Kenneth Mak, told Singapore's Straits Times newspaper that investigations were still unfolding around the spread of infections connected to the church.
"We have not identified a single individual to be a super spreader," he said.
In Britain, one man who traveled from Singapore to France to Switzerland and then back home to England was later identified as a "superspreader," a term used to describe someone with an outsize role in transmitting an infection. British authorities believe he contracted the coronavirus while in Singapore for a sales conference held at a hotel.

6:20 AM: Hong Kong announces billion-dollar recovery package for industries, groups hit by coronavirus
HONG KONG — The Hong Kong government is hoping to soften the blow of the coronavirus outbreak on its hard-hit sectors, setting aside a multibillion-dollar relief package for tourism-related businesses, restaurants and other vulnerable and affected groups.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced Friday that she will ask the legislative council to approve doubling a fund set aside for the outbreak to $3.2 billion, hoping to use this money to subsidize restaurants, tour operators and other affected industries. The plan calls for direct subsidies to incentivize firms to make surgical masks, as well as financial assistance to the elderly, hawkers and retailers.
Subsidies will also be extended to residents who had been allocated units in two public housing estates earmarked as quarantine sites, Lam added. Each household will receive a single payment of $770.
"We urge all lawmakers to support the funding," she said.
Meanwhile, three new coronavirus cases have been confirmed, bringing the total in Hong Kong to 56.
The city's economic minister said Friday that the government has also requested consent from the Hong Kong Disneyland Park to create more quarantine camps on land originally zoned for the park's expansion, if cases spike.

5:40 AM: International Olympic Committee says no reason to cancel or relocate Tokyo Games
YOKOHAMA, Japan — The International Olympic Committee said Friday it has been advised by the World Health Organization that there was "no case" to cancel or relocate the Tokyo 2020 Olympics over the coronavirus outbreak.

A day after Japan reported its first death from the new coronavirus, John Coates, the head of the IOC's Coordination Commission, said he continued to expect the Games to go ahead as planned.
Advice from the WHO was that "there is no case for any contingency plans of canceling the Games or moving the Games," Coates said, according to Reuters.
The coronavirus epidemic has already caused several international sporting events to be canceled or postponed, including the Shanghai Grand Prix, while Olympic qualifying events in soccer, badminton and basketball had to be moved out of China.
Coates said coordination between the Japan organizing committee's virus task force and other national authorities reinforced the IOC's confidence that the situation was being properly addressed, Reuters reported.
That raised expectations that "we'll be able to ensure that the Games go ahead in a way that's safe for the athletes and spectators," Coates told a news conference in Tokyo.
Toshiro Muto, the chief executive of the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee, said last week he was "seriously worried" that the virus might affect momentum toward the Games, but he pledged the following day the event would go ahead as planned

5:10 AM: Thailand weighs visa-free policy for Chinese travelers — but only after coronavirus eases
Thailand's tourism officials are pushing for visa-free entry for Chinese citizens, the Bangkok Post reported, hoping to kick-start a tourism sector that is suffering heavy losses over the coronavirus outbreak.

Tourism and Sports Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, quoted in the report, said the number of Chinese tourists arriving in Thailand fell about 87 percent in the first nine days of February compared with a year earlier and is likely to drop about 90 percent overall this month. International tourist arrivals overall have dropped by about 43 percent, he added.
Thailand's government is now eyeing a revival in April, hoping that infections will level off by then and that Chinese authorities will lift a travel ban by late March. Tourism officials hope to submit the visa-free proposal for Chinese tourists in April, on the condition that the outbreak is managed and under control.
Southeast Asia is reeling from the loss of billions of dollars in tourism receipts from mainland Chinese arrivals, who cannot come because of the lockdowns in place across a swath of China and travel restrictions imposed by individual countries. In Thailand, the government expects a loss of $8 billion, roughly 1.5 percent of gross domestic product.

4:40 AM: Flower market sees Valentine's Day sales wilt
BEIJING — This season looks grim for the thousands of vendors at China's largest flower trading center, Kunming Dounan market, which sells billions of freshly cut flowers a year and accounts for almost three-quarters of flower transactions in China.
The Dounan market saw its supplies halved and wholesale prices slump by more than 70 percent on Feb. 10, the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year holiday. A manager of Kunming International Flower Auction Exchange Center estimated that Yunnan's flower farmers and vendors stand to lose up to $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2020.
"Roses were thrown away in huge piles," a wholesaler, who identified himself only as Hu, told the 21st Century Business Herald on Friday.
A retailer, identified only as Zhang, said traffic-control measures due to the coronavirus outbreak have cut off supplies from some flower-growing villages in Yunnan and hindered the transportation of fresh flowers to other parts of China.
"I only hope I can go back to work as soon as possible," Zhang said, adding that Valentine's Day normally accounts for 20 to 30 percent of annual sales.

4:28 AM: Singapore leader warns of possible recession over coronavirus
Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the coronavirus outbreak has seriously affected the city-state's economy, which could slide into recession over the coming quarters.
Quoting the prime minister on a visit to Singapore's airport, the Straits Times reported that the coronavirus has already hit the economy harder than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which lasted about five months.
"It's already much more than SARS, and the economies of the region are much more interlinked together. China, particularly, is a much bigger factor in the region," Lee said.
Singapore has 58 confirmed cases, among the highest tallies globally. Taiwan, South Korea and others have added Singapore to their lists of travel advisories, urging citizens to refrain from visiting. Singapore. meanwhile, has also barred all arrivals from mainland China to minimize the risk of further outbreaks. The government is bracing for a serious impact on tourism, estimating that arrivals will drop by 25 to 30 percent.
"I can't say whether we will have a recession or not," Lee said, according to the Straits Times. "It's possible, but definitely our economy will take a hit."

3:43 AM: Japan reports another four cases of coronavirus as risk of full-blown outbreak grows
TOKYO — Japan reported another four cases of the new coronavirus Friday, adding to four cases announced the previous day and bringing the national total to 36, as fears rise that the country could be facing its own outbreak of the disease.
One of the most worrying cases announced Thursday was a doctor in the eastern prefecture of Wakayama. On Feb. 7, a former patient at the hospital, a male farmer in his 70s, was found to have the virus. One other doctor and one other patient were also showing some pneumonia-like symptoms and awaiting test results.
A case was also confirmed in the southwestern island of Okinawa, the last port of call of the cruise ship Diamond Princess before it was placed in quarantine in Yokohama last week. A female taxi driver in her 60s found to have the virus was among 200 people who had been under monitoring in Okinawa because they had been in contact with passengers from then ship during their 9.5-hour stay.

The other two cases were found in Tokyo, both in people believed to have been in contact with a taxi driver diagnosed with the virus on Thursday, Japanese media reported. The driver said he had carried Chinese passengers.
Japan's government vowed to step up testing for the virus on Friday, but Health Minister Katsunobu Kato tried to play down concerns.
"We do not have sufficient evidence to change our current position that the outbreak is not widespread," he said, according to broadcaster NHK. "Yet we cannot deny it has spread. We are preparing for that situation so we would be ready if we get into that situation."
Masahiro Kami, executive director at the Medical Governance Research Institute in Tokyo, said the fight against the virus is entering a new phase in Japan.
"The public has now come to be aware that an outbreak is spreading within Japan," he said.
Kami said the virus had already been spreading undetected for some time — evidenced by the fact that a Thai couple were found to have the virus after returning from a visit to Japan. He added that the case of the doctor in Wakayama was a potentially serious problem.
"Doctors and other medical staff, if they get infected, have a possibility that they may transmit the infection to patients where they are hospitalized," he said. "And these are the people who are most vulnerable to the risk of death. This is an issue to which we have to give the highest attention now."

2:45 AM: Vietnam considers 'highest penalty' for factory making masks from toilet paper
Authorities have found a factory in Hanoi using toilet paper to produce face masks, the Vietnam Express reported, cutting corners as coronavirus fears fuel rising demand for supplies of protective items.
Officials this week were suspicious when they found dozens of large toilet paper rolls at the factory, the outlet reported, and discovered that they were being used to replace the inner antibacterial layer that stops microbes from entering or exiting the surgical mask.

"This company is cheating consumers amid the novel coronavirus outbreak," said Hoang Dai Nghia from the Hanoi Market Surveillance Department. The company's stock has been confiscated, and authorities are now considering appropriate penalties.
According to the Vietnam Express, the company, Viet Han Company, is not listed as a medical equipment producer, but as a printer and napkin maker.
The World Health Organization has warned of a global shortage of surgical masks as customers, particularly in Asia, rush to protect themselves against the spread of the virus. Many factories are now trying to pivot and produce these items, but counterfeits have also flooded the market, with false trademarks and false details on where the masks originated from.

2:37 AM: More than 1,700 medical workers in China infected with virus
BEIJING — China's National Health Commission said Friday that at least 1,716 medical staff have contracted coronavirus, and six have died.
Zeng Yixin, the vice director of the National Health Commission, was citing the latest figures available as of Tuesday. Of these cases, 1,502 were reported in Hubei province. The health commission said that the illness will be identified as an occupation injury for medical workers, who will be covered by insurance.
The most sensitive of these cases is the death of Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor who is considered the first to sound the alarm about the new virus when he leaked a document on Dec. 30 from his hospital, confirming the diagnosis. When he succumbed from the disease, grief and rage filled social media, as the country saw his death as a parable for the Communist Party's failings.

2:10 AM: Chinese cities turn to apps, facial-recognition technology to police coronavirus
BEIJING — Chinese authorities in Nanjing have asked residents in the city of 8 million and returning workers to register their personal information on an app, as officials turn away travelers and other short-term visitors.
In a notice issued late Thursday, the Nanjing city government asked returning residents and migrant workers based there to register on an app called "Ning Guilai" — a pun that can either mean Nanjing Returns or Peace Returns. The app requires a facial scan to confirm that all identification information is accurate.
"Your travel could be affected if we find the information you filled in to be inaccurate; more importantly, it will leave a dark spot in your personal credit record," the Nanjing government's notice read, also warning of potential "legal liabilities."
The app also specified that only those with a permanent residence and workplace in Nanjing, and who are not from the epicenter of the outbreak, Hubei province, are free to travel into the city. Short-term visitors and travelers without a permanent residence or long-term job in Nanjing must postpone trips there, the city government said.
Shanghai has similarly relied on apps to track arrivals, announcing on Feb. 1 that visitors coming in from airports, train stations and toll gates would have to register their personal information on a smartphone app called Healthcare Cloud. The app was originally designed for making hospital appointments and other health services, but now includes a separate section that requires users to register their detailed personal information, including their ID, home and Shanghai addresses, phone number, emergency contact and travel itinerary.
Yunnan province this week also launched a WeChat in-app program, Kang Yiqing or "Fighting the Epidemic," that requires residents to register their personal information by scanning a QR code when entering a public venue — including residential areas, farmers markets, shopping malls, supermarkets and subway stations.
"For those who refuse to cooperate, public venue management has the right to ban them from entering or exiting. Those who try to force into public venues without registration, disturb public order, or cause serious consequences, will be held accountable according to law," Yunnan authorities said.

1:50 AM: Japan says 10 people evacuated from the Diamond Princess in serious condition
YOKOHAMA, Japan — Japan's health ministry said on Friday that 10 people evacuated from the quarantined cruise ship the Diamond Princess are in serious condition, with eight confirmed to have the new coronavirus.
One of the other two is still awaiting results of a test.

Amid persistent criticism of its approach, the government said it would start allowing some people who have tested negative for the virus to disembark from the ship early, and finish their quarantine at a facility on land. Priority will be given to passengers over the age of 80 and those with existing medical problems, as well as people in windowless cabins, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said.
So far, 218 people on board the ship have tested positive for the virus, out of 713 people who have been assessed. The government says it plans to step up testing in a bid to examine everyone on board before the quarantine ends on Feb. 19.
A quarantine officer involved in screening passengers for the virus also fell sick, with the health ministry saying he did not follow proper procedures, wiping away sweat with his gloves and reusing a mask he had worn earlier, NHK reported.

1:35 AM: Love in a time of coronavirus: Roses are out, broccoli and hand sanitizer is in
BEIJING — Forget red roses. Broccoli, cauliflower, masks and hand sanitizer are now the way to prove you love your partner this Valentine's Day in China, according to Meituan, the country's largest on-demand services provider.
Flower delivery platforms are reporting a massive drop in online flower sales, as health fears dissuade people from ordering anything online or picking up deliveries. Zhong'ai Flower, an online flower delivery platform based in Wuhan, the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak, reported a sales drop of 90 percent. Ma Yingzi, a flower supplier in Beijing, also estimated a 95 percent drop in flower sales this Valentine's Day.
The new favorites: broccoli and cauliflower. Meituan said roses are no longer its most ordered items on this day of love, while the vegetables instead have become hot items. Broccoli in Chinese contains the word "flower" in its name, making it a popular gift in lieu of actual flowers, with more nutrients to boot.
Others are opting for more practical gifts instead of chocolate. Meituan's sales data show that gift orders still grew by 30 percent on Friday, but the most-searched present options were masks, goggles and disinfectants.

1:30 AM: Super Soaper Soffy, Wipe Up Wilson and Mask Up Mei Mei join Singapore's coronavirus fight
Singapore's education ministry has launched a new song — "Bye Bye Virus" — featuring a cast of virus-fighting superheroes in the hopes of teaching schoolchildren best-practice hygiene measures to fend off the outbreak.
It even comes with a dance.
The lyrics replicate advice that has been doled out by the government in recent weeks, but in rhymes: "Wear a mask if you're falling sick / go see a doctor, don't be so thick." The chorus is simply "coronavirus go away, don't you stay."
The cast of superhero characters, like Mask Up Mei Mei and Wipe Down Wilson, all provide specific tips on mask-wearing and hand-washing, and they remind students to avoid touching their faces.
Experts have praised Singapore's transparency and proactive measures in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. The city-state has 58 confirmed cases, one of the highest of any country, but health experts say it has been more proactive about weeding out confirmed cases and tracking down clusters of infection.
Unlike Hong Kong, which has a similar number of infections and a similar population, Singapore has not closed schools, and lessons have continued largely as usual. Only interschool activities have been canceled. Singapore has been focusing its public education efforts on schools and the young, who are vulnerable to the spread of diseases.

1:23 AM: More counties in Hubei enact 'wartime measures,' barring citizens from leaving home
BEIJING — Hubei's most densely populated county became the latest to implement "wartime measures" to control the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, effectively barring residents from leaving their homes.
The Yunmeng Public Security Bureau said on its official WeChat account that these measures would take effect Friday. All residential complexes have been sealed off and only essential vehicles will be allowed on the roads.
"Anyone who forces their way out of compounds, buildings or road connections will be detained," Yunmeng authorities said.
Neighborhood communities are required to assign staff to help residents buy daily necessities. The county has over 300 confirmed coronavirus infections, and has a population of about half a million people.
The orders will be in place for about two weeks, according to Chinese state media.
Experts have questioned the effectiveness of these lockdowns and the legality of applying "wartime" controls in this public health emergency.

Full text: The World Health Organization will reconvene its emergency committee Thursday to determine whether the coronavirus outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international concern, as the total number of people infected in mainland China surpassed those infected with SARS during the 2002-2003 epidemic.
Experts say a vaccine for the virus is still a long way off. Schools in Beijing have closed indefinitely, and foreigners who have been evacuated from Wuhan, which is at the epicenter of the outbreak, are starting to arrive in their home countries or at temporary screening sites, including via charter flights for Japanese and U.S. citizens.
Many countries are curtailing flights to China, with American Airlines suspending several routes scheduled for February and March. British Airways and German carrier Lufthansa also suspended flights, as did airlines in India and Kazakhstan. Here's what we know:
● The death toll has risen to 170 in China, with more than 7,7oo confirmed cases of infection as of Thursday morning local time — a day-over-day increase of more than 1,500. Other countries in the region also are reporting more people infected — nearly all of them tourists from China.
● At least 71 cases have been recorded outside of China and the self-ruling island of Taiwan. Person-to-person transmission of the virus has been reported in China, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany.
● More than 200 Americans evacuated from Wuhan landed in California on Wednesday. After evacuating 206 people from the virus epicenter Wednesday morning, Japan is readying a second charter flight to bring more of its citizens. Twelve Japanese evacuees were showing symptoms of illness and have been hospitalized.
● The United Arab Emirates has reported four cases — the first in the Middle East — from one family traveling from Wuhan. Hong Kong and Australia both reported two new cases Wednesday.
● Infections also have been confirmed in France, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, Cambodia, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, Canada and Sri Lanka. We're mapping the spread here.

10:00 PM: Global companies scramble to respond to coronavirus in China
Some of the world's largest corporations shuttered operations in China on Wednesday as the worsening coronavirus outbreak renewed concerns about their reliance on Chinese factories and threatened to take a lasting financial toll.
With an official lockdown affecting more than 50 million people, consumer spending on restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues in China has plunged. Many factories have extended their customary closure beyond the end of the Lunar New Year celebration to at least the second week of February.
The enforced inactivity could rattle supply chains for products that are sold in U.S. stores and around the world. Some of Apple's Chinese suppliers, for example, now are scheduled to remain closed until Feb. 10, chief executive Tim Cook told investors Tuesday, adding that executives are "working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss."
Most analysts remain upbeat, but the economic consequences of the fast-moving virus could snowball if the problem isn't soon contained, some executives said. China is the world's second-largest economy and home to factories that produce machinery, computers, furniture and chemicals for customers on every continent. In one sign of mounting worry, a growing number of major airlines have halted or reduced flights to and from China.
The health crisis comes just two weeks after the signing of a U.S.-China trade deal eased the uncertainty that had shrouded Chinese export factories for nearly two years. Across the globe, health officials, corporate executives and central bankers on Wednesday struggled to determine the bottom-line impact of the outbreak.

9:30 PM: Three Japanese evacuees test positive for coronavirus; second flight lands
TOKYO — Three of the Japanese citizens who returned from the virus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan have tested positive for deadly coronavirus, the health ministry said on Thursday, as a second flight from the city landed in Tokyo.
The three, including two who had not shown any symptoms of the disease, were among 206 people brought out on the first flight, which landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport Wednesday, Kyodo News agency reported.
Among the first batch of returnees, all but two agreed to a test for the virus, Kyodo reported. Those testing positive for the virus will be isolated in a hospital, while most of the rest will be put up in a hotel for two weeks with regular medical checks. Three of the group insisted on returning to their homes, where they will also be visited regularly, officials said.
Another 210 evacuees were brought out on Thursday, with some showing symptoms such as coughs, and the government is already making arrangements for a third flight.
The first group was selected from people living closest to the seafood market in Wuhan thought to be the source of the virus, and also people living close to the airport.
The mayor of Wuhan said last weekend that 5 million people had left the city before a lockdown was imposed.

9:00 PM: Overwatch League cancels China matches for February, March
WASHINGTON — The Overwatch League, a competitive e-sports league with international ambitions for its 2020 season, announced in a tweet Wednesday night that its February and March matches scheduled to be held in China have been canceled.
"We have decided to cancel our February and March matches in China in order to protect the health and safety of our players, fans and staff," the league wrote, noting that more information about the canceled matches would be forthcoming.
The League plans to hold matches in China later this season, according to the tweet, but it did not address when or where the canceled matches would take place. A Feb. 15 match in Shanghai was originally scheduled to be the international debut for the league.
Earlier this week, two of the four teams based in China announced that they would temporarily relocate to South Korea. One team — the only team in the Overwatch League with an entire roster and coaching staff from China — announced that it would remain in China for the start of the season.
Given the unpredictable situation and the potential for future travel restrictions on flights out of China, departing the country now may be the only way to assure that the Chinese teams can participate in any of the league's upcoming contests. Some countries have started restricting the admittance of passengers on flights and other means of travel originating from China.

7:45 PM: Amazon and Microsoft restricting staff travel to China
SEATTLE — Both Amazon and Microsoft are shutting down nearly all travel of their workers to China.
"Out of an abundance of caution, we are restricting business travel to and from China until further notice," Amazon spokeswoman Jaci Anderson said.
On Wednesday, the e-commerce giant barred non-approved business travel to and from China and will grant approval only for trips that are critical to the company's business, Anderson said. Amazon also said that those who travel to one of the affected provinces of China should work from home for two weeks upon their return.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.
Microsoft, meanwhile, noted that the coronavirus outbreak could hamper its Windows operating system business. During its quarterly earnings call Wednesday, finance chief Amy Hood gave a wider-than-usual guidance for the business segment that includes Microsoft's Windows operating system business, which it sells to PC makers, citing "some of the uncertainty related to the public health situation in China." The company now expects to generate $10.75 billion to $11.15 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue from its More Personal Computing segment compared to $10.68 billion in the year-ago period.
Microsoft is also restricting staff travel in China. The company has told employees in the country to work from home and cancel all nonessential business travel until Feb. 9. The company has also advised workers to avoid non-essential travel to China.

7:15 PM: Tesla expecting production delays over the spread of coronavirus
SAN FRANCISCO — Add Tesla to the list of companies expecting potential business consequences in China.
On the company's earnings call Wednesday, Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said it is monitoring the effects of the coronavirus in China, where it recently opened its Shanghai Gigafactory to deliver locally made Model 3 sedans.
The company is building up its production capacity to meet the high Chinese demand for electric vehicles and Tesla's mass-market sedan.
"At this point we're expecting a one to one-and-a-half-week delay in the ramp of Shanghai Model 3," Kirkhorn said, adding the effects might "slightly impact" the company's first quarter profitability. "We are also closely monitoring whether there will be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in Fremont."

6:55 PM: China confirms more than 1,000 additional cases of coronavirus and another 38 deaths
WASHINGTON — Amid another day of increasing travel restrictions and international evacuation efforts, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in China and Taiwan continues to rise dramatically.
By 8:30 Thursday morning Beijing time, Chinese health agencies had recorded another 1,658 confirmed cases overnight, bringing the total to 7,736, including eight in the self-ruling island of Taiwan. It's at least the second consecutive day the number of confirmed cases rose by more than 1,500.
The death toll also increased by 38, to 170, with all but eight of those killed coming from Hubei province, the epicenter of the disease, according to a tally from national and local health commissions. Another 124 people have been successfully treated, the agencies reported.
Patients from Wuhan, which is still under an unprecedented quarantine, make up more than three-quarters of the dead.
Chinese President Xi Jinping deemed the situation "complicated and grave."

5:45 PM: CDC says no new confirmed cases in U.S., expects its experts to be part of international team to China
WASHINGTON — A top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday that there are no new confirmed cases of coronavirus. The United States has five confirmed cases.
Officials said 97 people are under observation after 68 tested negative and were ruled out for infection.
The CDC, which has many respiratory virus experts, has also been invited to be part of the international team that the World Health Organization is assembling to send to China to assist with the outbreak investigation.
"The information we have right now is that we are invited to be part of this WHO mission," said Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "We are working through the particulars with the WHO. ... The plans are to include CDC as part of that team."

5:15 PM: Coronavirus fears reignite debate over face masks' merits
WASHINGTON — Manufacturers are scrambling to keep up with a demand for face masks fueled by fear of coronavirus.
But are they necessary? Not if you're just walking around in Beijing, one government expert said in an interview clip shared Wednesday by Chinese state media.
"Don't overreact," said Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, even as he wore a green mask of his own. He added later: "The possibility of getting infected in the street is less than the chance of being in a car accident."
But many public health officials do recommend face masks in China, especially for people who think they may be sick. The most commonly worn, cheap and disposable masks, known as the surgical masks, will limit — but not eliminate — the chance of inhaling large, infectious particles circulating near the face, said Marybeth Sexton, an assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine.
Even with perfect use, these masks aren't foolproof because a virus or pathogen can still slip through the sides or enter the body through the eyes.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that any health-care workers interacting with coronavirus patients or suspected cases wear a stronger kind of mask, known as the N95 respirator, along with other gear such as gloves and eye protectors.
The CDC has not, however, suggested face masks to the general public, noted William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University. Instead, the agency prescribes its usual tips for preventing the spread of respiratory viruses, including thorough hand-washing, avoiding close contact with sick people, staying home when ill and disinfecting often-touched surfaces.

4:45 PM: New Zealand will not quarantine citizens on Christmas Island, official says
WASHINGTON — New Zealand will not quarantine citizens evacuated from Wuhan on an Australian territory more than nearly 1,000 miles from the mainland, New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters clarified Thursday, following reports that Australia and New Zealand would both keep evacuees in a detention center on Christmas Island.
Leaders from Australia and New Zealand said this week that they were working together to evacuate citizens currently in Wuhan, and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the island's detention center would be temporarily used as a quarantine for Australian evacuees. But Peters said in an interview with Radio New Zealand on Wednesday that he is "looking at the quarantine options within New Zealand already."
Discussing the evacuation Tuesday, Morrison said that they are planning "assisted departures for isolated and vulnerable Australians in Wuhan and the Hubei province."
He said Australians included in the evacuation will be required to pay for some or all of the costs.
A Sri Lankan family of four who are facing deportation from Australia are currently the only detainees being held in the Christmas Island center. Their case has sparked controversy in Australia, where Morrison has overseen a tough crackdown on migration. Carina Ford, a lawyer for the family, told Australia's SBS News that they had not been formally informed of the plan to move travelers into the center where they are staying and that "it's not appropriate for them to remain on Christmas Island if you're quarantining people near them for the purpose of keeping them away from everyone else."
"There are two children, and it's quite well-publicized that such viruses can have a bigger impact on children and the elderly," she said.

4:30 PM: Google closing China, Taiwan offices amid outbreak
WASHINGTON — Google has shut down its offices in China and Taiwan due to the coronavirus outbreak, company spokesman Michael Appel said Wednesday.
The closures will continue according to government guidance, the tech company said, and follow many other firms' decisions to temporarily shutter locations in China. Officials there have extended the Lunar New Year holiday — originally set to end Jan. 30 — into early February as they try to combat the virus.
Google is also restricting employees' travel and telling staff who leave China or have family returning from the country to work from home for at least 14 days after their departure.
Google lists offices in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Taipei, Taiwan. Its offices in these areas focus on sales and engineering for Google's advertising business, the company spokesman said.
Google says it has contributed $250,000 to the Chinese Red Cross and raised $500,000 with an internal campaign for relief efforts.

4:00 PM: Air Canada suspends all flights to Beijing, Shanghai
TORONTO — Air Canada said Wednesday that it would be suspending all flights to Beijing and Shanghai after the Canadian government urged against non-essential travel to mainland China.
The suspension will begin tomorrow and last until Feb. 29.
Air Canada operates 33 flights each week to China from Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal. Earlier this week, it began to cancel some flights to China after the coronavirus outbreak precipitated numerous cancellations and a drop in demand.

3:45 PM: Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, are being isolated voluntarily but could be quarantined if necessary
WASHINGTON — The 195 people flown to March Air Reserve Base in California on Wednesday are there voluntarily for 72 hours of testing and monitoring, but the government reserves the right to quarantine anyone who it believes would pose a risk to others by leaving, federal health officials said Wednesday.
The passengers, mainly State Department consular officials evacuated from Wuhan, China, will be allowed to continue on to their homes after 72 hours, where they will be monitored by state and local health officials, said Christopher R. Braden, deputy director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The evacuees, who include a 1-month-old infant and other children, were screened twice before they boarded the chartered flight — first by the Chinese government, then by U.S. State Department doctors — and then were monitored by medical officials aboard the plane. While it refueled in Anchorage, they were taken off the aircraft and screened again, then screened once more when they landed at the base. One person who had a fever was not allowed to board in China, said Nancy Knight, director of the CDC's Division of Global Health Protection.
The evacuees will be housed on the base, but separated from personnel there, while specimens are sent to the CDC in Atlanta for testing, officials said. Once it is confirmed that they do not have the virus, they will be sent home, but monitored for the full two weeks of the virus's incubation period, they said. That includes taking their temperature twice a day and responding to telephone calls from local health officials.
Braden said the people he spoke with mainly want to know whether they have the virus and were amenable to remaining at the base while testing is carried out. But he said if anyone wants to leave before the three-day period expires and officials believe it is too risky, they have the right hold them.
"If we have to do an individual quarantine, we will," he said. "If we think it's risky, then we have the tools to protect the public, and we will use them."

3:30 PM: Major African airlines continue flying to China; Air Tanzania postpones launch of Guangzhou flight
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — While more than a dozen airlines around the world decided to suspend or reduce flights to China, airlines from Africa have decided to monitor the situation further before taking such measures. African governments also have so far decided against evacuating citizens of their countries.
Spokespeople for Africa's two largest carriers, Ethiopian and Kenya airlines, said in phone calls that they would evaluate all options over the next few days. Air Tanzania, which was scheduled to launch a direct flight from Dar es Salaam to Guangzhou in February, announced Wednesday that it would indefinitely postpone the service, according to Reuters.
China shares close business ties with most African countries, and tens of thousands of African students attend universities across China.
Authorities in Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Zambia, Equatorial Guinea and Ivory Coast reported suspected cases over the past few days; those people were quarantined promptly. On Wednesday night, Ivory Coast's Health Ministry said the single case there had tested negative. Officials in the other countries were still awaiting results; the only laboratory that can test for the novel coronavirus on the continent is in South Africa.

3:15 PM: Fed Chair Powell says officials are 'monitoring the situation' very closely when asked about coronavirus
WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said central bankers were monitoring the coronavirus crisis very closely, adding that it was uncertain what the economic impact would eventually be.
"The situation is really in its early stages," Powell told reporters. "It's very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be. I'm not going to speculate about it at this point. We are very carefully monitoring the situation."

3:00 PM: Experts debunk fringe theory linking China's coronavirus to weapons research
WASHINGTON — As China attempts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, rumors and disinformation have proliferated amid the scramble for answers.
Some of the speculation has centered on a virology institute in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began. One fringe theory holds that the disaster could be the accidental result of biological weapons research.
The British newspaper Daily Mail and the Washington Times, a conservative newspaper in D.C., published articles exploring the possibility.
But in conversations with The Washington Post, experts rejected the idea that the virus could be manmade.
"Based on the virus genome and properties, there is no indication whatsoever that it was an engineered virus," said Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University.
Tim Trevan, a biological safety expert based in Maryland, said most countries had largely abandoned their bioweapons research after years of work proved fruitless.
"The vast majority of new, nasty diseases . . . come from nature," he said.

2:45 PM: Chinese communities fear a rise in discrimination as virus spreads
BERLIN — Chinese communities around the world are expressing fears of a discriminatory backlash as the virus spreads, with some seeing measures to control the virus as having played a role in stoking xenophobic attitudes toward Chinese minority groups and travelers.
Several countries or territories have restricted travel from mainland China, including Malaysia, which on Tuesday said it would halt the issuance of visas to visitors from China's Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.
But some Malaysians found the step insufficient. An online petition launched last week seeking an outright entry ban on Chinese citizens entering the country garnered more than 400,000 supporters by Wednesday. In a text accompanying the petition, its creators appeared to blame Chinese nationals' supposed "unhygienic lifestyle" for the spread of coronavirus.
Similar petitions have also emerged in Singapore and South Korea.
Some communities in Canada and France pushed back against the use of discriminatory language this week.
Under the hastag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus (I'm not a virus), Asians in France have taken to social media to identify cases of abuse and discrimination.
In Ontario, Canada, a school board said it would not ban children with family members who recently returned from China after a petition seeking their temporary removal from classrooms gained nearly 10,000 signatures.
"What we're trying really to get at is to [make sure] this situation is not giving rise to any inadvertent racism or any of those things that we could single out a community at this time," school board member Juanita Nathan told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday.
Canada faced some of the same tension during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, which also originated in China.
"While we learned from SARS there is no correlation between having SARS and being Chinese, there was a lot of racial profiling and racism during that time," Avvy Go, a legal clinic director in Canada, told CTV on Wednesday.

2:35 PM: Canada to evacuate citizens from China
TORONTO — The Canadian government said Wednesday that it had secured a chartered airplane to evacuate its nationals from China, as the novel coronavirus continues to spread across the country.
Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Ottawa that 160 Canadians in China have asked the government for consular assistance. It is unclear when the evacuation will begin, he added, because Canada is still working out logistics with China.
Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the government has not yet decided whether the Canadians will be quarantined once they arrive in Canada to prevent the spread of the illness. She is seeking advice from her U.S. counterparts.
Champagne also said that Canada has updated its travel advisory for China, urging against all non-essential travel to the country. Previously, the government had only advised against all travel to Hubei province, which is at the center of the outbreak, because of the imposition of travel restrictions there to prevent the spread of the virus.

2:25 PM: Boeing to donate 250,000 face masks to Chinese health officials
WASHINGTON — Boeing will donate 250,000 medical-grade respiratory masks to Chinese health officials hoping to combat the spread of the coronavirus in Wuhan and Zhoushan, the company said Wednesday, after already providing about 25,000 masks to employees working in the region.
"Our thoughts continue to be with all those in China dealing with the health impacts related to the coronavirus," Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in a news release announcing the donation. "Through our donation, it is our hope that we can help limit the spread of this virus and ease the burden on local aid workers and medical personnel."
Medical-grade masks have disappeared from shelves, and medical facilities have reported shortages of masks and other supplies as they work to control the outbreak. On social media, hospitals and health authorities have been issuing urgent requests for donations of basic supplies such as masks.
The central government has allocated emergency funding to buy supplies, but many basics have been hard to come by. At the beginning of the week, one surgical mask company said it had received orders for 80 million masks.

2:15 PM: WHO officials say Chinese actions have helped prevent virus spread to other countries
WASHINGTON — WHO officials went out of their way Wednesday to praise China for its actions to prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, said at a news briefing in Geneva that he has been criticized for praising China, but he underscored that Beijing's actions have helped reduce spread to other countries. "We should not fail to tell the truth because of some pressure from one corner," he said.
Outside of China and the self-ruling island of Taiwan, at least 71 cases have been reported in at least 15 countries, including for the first time in the Middle East — in the United Arab Emirates, according to the WHO. That's only about 1 percent of the more than 6,000 confirmed cases, WHO officials said.
Tedros's remarks appeared to be aimed at U.S. health officials who have criticized Chinese authorities for not inviting U.S. and other international investigative agencies to join them in researching the new virus. While China has been more transparent than it was during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak that also emerged from that country, U.S. officials are still getting their information through press briefings rather than from direct transfer of scientific data, a top U.S. health official said Monday.
WHO officials are assembling a team of international experts to collaborate with the Chinese on the ground but declined to say what countries the experts would come from and whether they would include scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

2:10 PM: Coronavirus spread raises concern for Uighurs incarcerated in western China
WASHINGTON — Thirteen cases of coronavirus have been confirmed thus far in China's western region of Xinjiang, where at least 1 million Uighur Muslims are being detained and subjected to political indoctrination programs. China calls the detention centers reeducation camps meant to counteract extremism, but human rights groups say they are intended to stamp out Uighur culture and Islam.
What the outbreak means for people in Xinjiang remains an open question.
The cramped and unhygienic camp conditions are ripe for an outbreak: Uighurs interned in Xinjiang have reported sleeping many to a room, eating inadequate and nonnutritious food, living with poor sanitation and being subjected to other stresses that can weaken immune systems, along with cases of torture, rape and forced sterilization.
That people are locked up could, for now, also limit their exposure to the outbreak.
"If you're in a prison or a detention center, I'm assuming you have pretty good control over who comes in and out," said J. Stephen Morrison, director of the global health policy center and senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They are in a much better place to control the outbreak" should one occur, Morrison added. "If you are in a region that's not been affected much, they've had time to put in screening and testing. All of those things have been missing or overwhelmed in the hot zone areas of Hubei."
Leaked classified Chinese government documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists include a telegram from the Communist Party commission in charge of Xinjiang security that lists preventing "food safety incidents and outbreaks" as a top priority. The document goes on to specifically list "influenzas, typhoid, tuberculosis and other epidemic diseases" as potential problems to watch out for — raising the question about why there is a fear of such dangerous diseases in the camps to begin with if conditions are as pristine as Chinese authorities have claimed.
Analysts have also predicted that if the virus were to spread among the Uighur population, China, which has sought to restrict any information coming out about conditions in Xinjiang, would not be forthcoming, further raising the risk.

2:00 PM: Malaysia detains four more people for allegedly spreading false information about coronavirus
WASHINGTON — Malaysian authorities said Wednesday that they have detained four more people suspected of "spreading false news" about coronavirus, one day after arresting a man on similar allegations.
Officials alleged that a 49-year-old part-time tutor and a 24-year-old student spread false information about the virus on Facebook and Twitter, respectively. Two pharmacy assistants between the ages of 25 and 30 were also detained "to assist in investigations" connected to fake news on Facebook, said the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission.
Four smartphones were confiscated along with SIM cards and memory cards during raids, according to the commission, which vowed to "step up enforcement."
The latest suspects face a maximum fine of more than $12,000 and up to a year's imprisonment. The fine could increase if they are found to continue their offenses after conviction.
Malaysia's prime minister has denounced misinformation about the virus as stoking both fear and racism, amid concerns about anti-Chinese sentiment in the country.
"The government will take action on those spreading fake news to instill fear among Malaysians and incite hatred among the races in Malaysia," Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said, according to the South China Morning Post.

1:45 PM: Coronavirus concerns threaten to alter esports league's ambitious plans
WASHINGTON — Esports leagues are among the sports organizations affected by the outbreak. The Overwatch League, a 20-team, international competitive video-gaming league built around the team-based shooter game Overwatch, is assessing early-season matches scheduled to be held in the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hangzhou. A Feb. 15 match in Shanghai, about 500 miles from Wuhan, is scheduled to be the international debut for the league, which had previously held all its matches in the United States.
According to several people familiar with the league's planning, as of Tuesday afternoon, league executives and teams were holding discussions on how to deal with the situation, which complicates the league's designs on several levels. An announcement from the league is expected this week, potentially as early as Wednesday.
The league features teams based in the Chinese cities of Guangzhou, Chengdu and Hangzhou, in addition to Shanghai. Guangzhou was set to host competitions the weekend of Feb. 22, followed by matches in Hangzhou the weekend of Feb. 29. It is not known whether those competitions would be relocated to other cities or rescheduled.
The Overwatch League declined to comment on the status of its planning when contacted Wednesday by The Washington Post.

1:30 PM: Google searches for 'Corona beer virus' spike amid outbreak
WASHINGTON — A subset of people are curious to find out whether there's a connection between the coronavirus and the Mexico-produced Corona beer. To be clear, there is none. Google searches for "beer virus" and "corona beer virus" have dramatically increased in the past few days, according to Google Trends.
Overall, Google Trends reported Tuesday a 1,050 percent increase in searches worldwide for "coronavirus symptoms" as the pneumonia-like disease continued to spread in China and elsewhere.
The House on Hood bar in New Zealand has even tried to capitalize on the linguistic similarity by offering reduced-price Coronas for the duration of the outbreak.
"Virus or no virus, we still think Coronas are pretty great, so while the pandemic lasts, we're selling Coronas for just $6.50, all day, every day," reads a Facebook post from Tuesday. The advertisement includes a picture of two people dressed in white protective gear and face masks and holding a Corona beer below the words "Catch some Corona at House this summer."
Some Facebook users laughed in response. Others were appalled.
"While NZ might not be directly affected at present, these people are literally suffering and its honestly shameful to use their deaths as a marketing strategy," one user wrote. "It's not funny at all."

1:15 PM: Plane carrying U.S. evacuees from Wuhan lands in California
WASHINGTON — An airplane carrying about 200 American evacuees from Wuhan landed at a California Air Force reserve base Wednesday, according to footage released by Reuters.

Those on board included State Department employees, their families and other U.S. citizens. They will be housed on the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, Defense Department spokesman Chris Mitchell said. He said they will stay there for three to 14 days.
During that time, the evacuees will not be in direct contact with Defense Department personnel and "will not have access to any base location other than their assigned housing," Pentagon press secretary Alyssa Farah said in a statement.
Support for the evacuees "will not negatively impact readiness or critical operations," Farah added. She said that anyone discovered to be ill will be taken to a civilian hospital and that the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for caring for and monitoring the evacuees.
Earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement that it was working with HHS and the State Department on "the logistics of public health evaluations for every traveler on the flight." Those on board would be screened before takeoff and during a stop in Anchorage for refueling and would be assessed on arrival, the agency said. Medical personnel also were monitoring passengers during the flight.

12:45 PM: American, British airlines reduce flights to China
WASHINGTON — American Airlines and British Airways reduced direct flights to and from China on Wednesday, joining a growing cluster of international carriers suspending service. Lufthansa canceled all China flights until Feb. 9, though the German carrier said it would continue service to Hong Kong.
American Airlines suspended some flights to China, including routes from Los Angeles to Shanghai and Beijing from Feb. 9 to March 27. The carrier said it saw "significant decline in demand for travel to and from China." British Airways canceled its daily flights from Heathrow Airport to Beijing and Shanghai until further notice.
United Airlines said it would disrupt service from Feb. 1 to Feb. 8, also because of a "significant decline in demand." The move affected 24 round trips between the United States and Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Air Seoul and Indonesia's Lion Air also suspended all flights to China, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific said it would cut flights to and from China by at least 50 percent through the end of March.
American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United extended their change fee waivers through the end of February. Other major airline carriers have canceled or cut back on flights to and from China as well.
CNBC, citing unnamed sources, reported that the White House has told airline executives it is considering suspending flights from China, although it has not yet done so.
Meanwhile, the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said screening for the virus at U.S. airports would be expanded.

12:10 PM: U.S. flight out of Wuhan prioritized vulnerable Americans, State Department says
WASHINGTON — A charter flight that evacuated U.S. citizens out of Wuhan prioritized "vulnerable individuals at higher risk from coronavirus," a State Department official said Wednesday, including "small children, older adults and persons with other health conditions that put them at greater risk."
"If such individuals were accompanied by family members who were not at greater risk, the families were allowed to travel together," the official said, speaking on background under State Department rules for talking with reporters.

12:00 PM: Multinational firms, including Starbucks, scramble to deal with coronavirus fallout in China as economic impact mounts
WASHINGTON — A growing number of multinational companies are moving swiftly to reroute or temporarily close their operations in China as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies. The global economic impact of the virus was still difficult to determine, but companies appeared to be pulling back at a much greater frequency on Wednesday out of fear that things will only worsen.
For restaurants, manufacturers and many others, the outbreak has dealt a sudden blow to the spending habits and daily routines of millions of people in Wuhan, plus major economic centers in Beijing and Shanghai. And the closure of many Chinese businesses, particularly manufacturers, is likely to disrupt supply chains for products that are sold around the world.
Starbucks temporarily closed more than half of its stores — a total of more than 2,000 locations — in China, it's second-largest market outside the United States.
Chinese sales account for about 10 percent of Starbucks's global revenue, and the coffee giant has roughly 4,300 locations on the mainland. Chief executive Kevin Johnson said he had planned to raise the company's financial forecast for the year on Tuesday but decided not to "due to the dynamic situation unfolding with the coronavirus." Company shares were down 2.75 percent Wednesday morning.
McDonald's, KFC and Apple also have announced closures, and the virus could affect quarterly performance. Walt Disney Co. said it would temporarily close its Disneyland and Disneytown parks in Shanghai.

11:40 AM: Finland confirms first coronavirus case
BERLIN — A 32-year-old Chinese woman has been confirmed as the first coronavirus patient in Finland, authorities there said Wednesday.
The woman left Hubei province shortly before Chinese authorities instituted a lockdown there last week, Finland's public broadcaster Yle reported.
Around 15 people in Finland may have had sufficiently close contact with the tourist to become infected.
Finland is the third E.U. member state with a confirmed infection. France and Germany have each reported four cases.

10:45 AM: WHO to reconvene emergency committee as outbreak grows
WASHINGTON — The World Health Organization will reconvene its emergency committee Thursday to discuss whether the outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), a special designation reserved for serious crises. In earlier meetings, the committee was divided but ultimately declined to label the outbreak a PHEIC.
In a series of tweets Wednesday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, said that just 68 of the more than 6,000 new cases of coronavirus have been recorded outside China. But he cited person-to-person transmission in three different countries outside China as signaling "potential for further global spread."
"Of known cases, most people exhibit milder symptoms, but about 1 in 5 people have severe illness, including #pneumonia and respiratory failure," he wrote. He said he is concerned that the outbreak is coinciding with flu season and affecting health systems.

Tedros added that he just returned from China, where he described holding "frank talks" with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who he described as having "taken charge of a monumental national response" to the outbreak. He went on to say he welcomed China's invitation to allow the WHO to lead a team of global health experts to assess the outbreak inside China and work with their Chinese counterparts. "I appreciate such openness & urge this to continue from [China] & all other countries," he said.
Tedros said the "WHO deeply regrets" an error in a recent situation report on coronavirus, which he said inaccurately described the outbreak's global risk as "moderate." "This was a human error in preparing the report," he wrote. "I have repeatedly stated the high risk of outbreak."

10:30 AM: Pompeo says U.S. wants to be careful not to 'overreact' to outbreak
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters on board his plane Wednesday morning that the United States is closely monitoring the outbreak but does not want to "overreact."
When asked whether the State Department is considering banning travel to China, Pompeo said he did not want "to get ahead of any decisions or talk about internal deliberations" but that U.S. authorities are watching closely for developments that could merit changes in travel advisories, "including banning travel."
"The American people should know that there are enormous efforts underway by the United States government to make sure that we do everything we can to protect the American people and to reduce the risk all around the globe," he added.
Still, he said, the United States does not "want to react in a way that actually has the potential to make things worse and not better."

10:15 AM: Hubei provincial governor tells companies not to resume work until Feb. 13
WASHINGTON — Companies in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, should not resume work before Feb. 13, provincial governor Wang Xiaodong said Wednesday, according to Reuters.
The halt in business has raised concerns about disruptions to supply chains, although some companies say their output will continue as normal. Despite having a facility in Wuhan, the province's capital, Foxconn — an Apple supplier — has said it will be able to meet its "manufacturing obligations."
"We do not comment on our specific production practices, but we can confirm that we have measures in place" to ensure those obligations are met, the company told Reuters in a statement.
Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that the company has closed one of its stores in China and is limiting travel to only what's "business critical." The uncertainty generated by the coronavirus outbreak is reflected in an unusually wide range in revenue guidance for the firm's next quarter, he said.
Another corporate giant, Starbucks, says it has closed half of its stores in China, where the coffee chain has experienced its greatest store growth in recent times.
Meanwhile, companies that produce face masks have seen their stocks jump and are working to meet skyrocketing demand.
"We are ramping up to full production — we're going 24/7," Mike Roman, CEO of 3M, which makes masks, said on CNBC.

10:00 AM: Toyota suspends operations at Chinese plants
BERLIN — Automotive manufacturer Toyota announced Wednesday that it was suspending operations at its Chinese plants until at least Feb. 9.
"We will monitor the situation and make further decisions on operations from Feb. 10," company spokesman Maki Niimi told Bloomberg News.
The move came amid mounting concerns about the economic fallout from the coronavirus.
After Hong Kong reopened its financial markets on Wednesday, following the Lunar New Year pause, its benchmark index fell by more than 2 percent.
On Tuesday, Hong Kong's government had asked some civil servants to refrain from heading to work until next week. Other offices, museums and public facilities remain closed.
Several global banks with branches in Hong Kong, including UBS, Credit Suisse and Citigroup, advised employees who recently returned from mainland China to temporarily work from home. Several international banks have also imposed restrictions on travel to Hong Kong and the mainland.
In mainland China, such U.S. companies as McDonald's, Starbucks and Apple have shut some of their branches or reduced their operating hours in recent days.
Outside of China, German automotive supplier Webasto said Wednesday that the company had temporarily closed its headquarters near Munich. About 1,000 employees are affected.
Four of the company's staff members were diagnosed with coronavirus after an infected Chinese colleague traveled to southern Germany for a workshop and came into close contact with at least one staff member.

9:35 AM: Pompeo says U.S. will spare 'no effort' to protect U.S. citizens from outbreak
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Wednesday that he had spoken with senior Chinese official Yang Jiechi about evacuations from Wuhan.
"As always, our number one priority is protecting American citizens in times of crisis," Pompeo wrote. "We are sparing no effort to protect our people and help #China contain the #coronavirus outbreak."
More than 200 Americans landed in Anchorage late Tuesday evening local time on a chartered flight from Wuhan. They were screened for symptoms of the virus and then flown on to California, where they will be screened again.

9:00 AM: Tibet raises virus response to emergency level, bringing all of China to top-level alert
TOKYO — The government of China's Tibet Autonomous Region granted itself emergency powers on Wednesday to cope with the spread of coronavirus, bringing the entire country under the highest level of epidemic alert.
The Tibetan region announced its first suspected case of the virus earlier in the day, in a 34-year-old man who had taken a two-day train trip to the region's capital, Lhasa, from Jan. 22 to 24, and checked himself into a hospital on Saturday.
Now the region has upped its response level to Level One, following similar moves across the rest of the country last weekend.
The Level One protocol allows local governments to mobilize personnel, materials and means of transportation for the emergency response; temporarily requisition housing; enforce regional blockades; suspend mass activities; close businesses, factories and schools; quarantine patients; fix prices; and punish rumormongers, speculators and manufacturers of fake products.
While flights from Wuhan to most other parts of China were suspended Jan. 22, and the virus-hit city went into lockdown at 10 a.m. on Jan. 23, a final flight to Lhasa was allowed to take off at 10:21 a.m. that day.

8:35 AM: WHO says governments can decide whether to evacuate citizens
DUBAI — The World Health Organization said Wednesday it was up to individual governments to decide whether to evacuate their citizens from China amid the outbreak, Reuters reported.
The statement came after WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed his confidence in China's preventive measures and advised against countries evacuating their citizens.
Xinhua News Agency quoted Tedros as saying that WHO "does not recommend the evacuation of nationals, and called on the international community to remain calm and not overreact."
But on Wednesday, spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Reuters, "If countries want to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, WHO's position is that this is a matter for their governments to decide."
Japan and the United States have both evacuated 200 of their citizens from Wuhan in chartered flights. Several other countries have announced plans to move their nationals out as well.

8:30 AM: UNICEF ships six metric tons of medical supplies to China
WASHINGTON — The United Nations Children's Fund shipped more than six tons of medical supplies to China this week to help health workers grappling with the growing coronavirus outbreak.
UNICEF said in a statement that the shipment, which included face masks and protective suits, landed in Shanghai on Wednesday and will be sent on to Wuhan. The agency said children are among the almost 6,000 people infected with the illness.
In recent days, reports have emerged that hospitals are running out of key supplies, especially after a travel ban was put in place that essentially locked down more than 50 million people.
"This coronavirus is spreading at a breakneck speed and it is important to put all the necessary resources into halting it," said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. "We may not know enough about the virus's impact on children or how many may be affected — but we do know that close monitoring and prevention are key. Time is not on our side."

8:10 AM: Washington area universities call on students in China to return home
WASHINGTON — Students from several major universities in the Washington area studying abroad in China have been told to return home amid the coronavirus outbreak that has left more than 130 people dead and thousands infected.
American University is prohibiting travel to China, according to university spokeswoman Kelly Alexander, and its students studying in China report being told to return to the United States.
Georgetown University issued a similar warning, said school spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak. Three students studying in Beijing have been asked to leave, and school officials have temporarily banned university-related travel to China.
The University of Virginia has responded by advising students to leave their program at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, and continue their studies remotely, said Brian Coy, a university spokesman. Virginia Tech leaders have told faculty and students to avoid traveling to the country.
Leaders at George Washington University are helping students in China return home. And GWU students who had planned to travel to China in the coming weeks are working with university staff to make other arrangements, said Crystal Nosal, a spokeswoman.
At the University of Maryland's flagship campus in College Park, officials have delayed or canceled programs in China. Several potential coronavirus cases are under investigation in the United States. At George Mason University in Virginia, a student is awaiting lab tests to determine whether the student has the virus, the university said in a statement.

7:40 AM: Japan sends in second plane to evacuate nationals from virus epicenter
TOKYO — Japan is sending in a second charter flight on Wednesday evening to evacuate its nationals from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
The first plane brought out 206 people on Wednesday morning, 12 of whom have now been hospitalized after showing symptoms of illness, Japanese officials told reporters.
Five who had coughs or fever were sent to the hospital straight away, traveling from Haneda airport in separate ambulances. The remaining number went to different hospitals for tests, and seven of that group were later admitted to the hospital.

But even those not showing symptoms are still not in the clear. Most will stay in a hotel for two weeks where they will be monitored regularly, but three of the group asked to go home, where their health will also be regularly checked.
Japan also announced an eighth case of coronavirus on Wednesday after a tour guide who had traveled with a group of Chinese tourists contracted the illness. On Tuesday, the health ministry announced the tour bus driver had contracted the disease but now says a guide also fell ill. She is a woman in her 40s from the city of Osaka.
Officials said on Tuesday that around 650 Japanese nationals staying in the central province of Hubei had asked to be evacuated but said on Thursday that more people had contacted the government since then asking to leave.
The second flight is due to land in Tokyo on Thursday morning, and arrangements are already being made for a third charter flight.

7:25 AM: Kazakhstan cutting travel links with China over virus fears
MOSCOW — Kazakhstan, which shares a long border with China, will suspend all flights to its eastern neighbor on Monday amid concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, the Kazakh government's press service said in a statement.
Passenger transportation by bus between Kazakhstan and China was suspended Wednesday, and passenger trains between the two countries will be suspended starting Saturday. The issuance of visas to Chinese citizens is also being put on hold.
"The Kazakh government's interagency commission has taken a number of extra protective measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus around Kazakhstan's territory," the statement said.

No cases of coronavirus have been registered in Kazakhstan yet; however, Kazakh chief public health official Zhandarbek Bekshin told reporters at a news conference Wednesday that 35 people returning from China have been quarantined since Jan. 6.
Four of them were diagnosed with the flu, 22 with acute respiratory infections and one with a mixed infection of flu and parainfluenza, Bekshin said, according to the Interfax news agency.

7:10 AM: China's leader describes situation as 'still severe and complicated'
TOKYO — Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a message to the military warned that the situation in the country is "still severe and complicated."
More than 6,000 cases of infection by a new coronavirus have ripped through China with thousands more waiting to be confirmed. More than 50 million people have been put on lockdown around the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan.
Xi ordered the People's Liberation Army "to bear in mind the mission of army" and take actions as soon as they are ordered.

He challenged the army to "fight a hard battle" as they "actively support the local prevention and control of the epidemic."
With the health infrastructure across much of the affected areas overwhelmed by the rise in cases, China has mobilized its extensive military to join in the struggle against the outbreak.
The Communist Party is trying to manage the widespread anger over perceived bungling during the initial response to the outbreak.

5:40 AM: Novartis CEO warns coronavirus vaccine at least a year off
DUBAI — The head of one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies has warned that it will take at least a year to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus that has already killed more than 130 people in just a few weeks.
Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis, told CNBC that his company's operations in China were continuing unhindered and that the key to combating the disease will be to study its patterns and how it develops.

"We have to keep understanding the epidemiology of the virus," he said. "The reality is it will take over a year in my expectation to really find a new vaccine for this."
The multinational based in Basel, Switzerland, is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world by sales and market capital.

5:38 AM: Sporting events canceled, postponed or held elsewhere, as virus spreads
BERLIN — The coronavirus has resulted in the cancellation or postponement of numerous sporting events in China, as concerns mount that the virus could also impact the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
On Wednesday, the International Ski Federation (FIS) canceled several men's races in Yanqing that were set to take place in mid-February, scheduled in preparation for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
"Although the risk level in Yanqing is low, the health and welfare of the athletes and all participants must take priority," FIS President Gian Franco Kasper was quoted as saying in a release.
On Tuesday, the International Hockey Federation decided to postpone two Pro League women's matches in Changzhou, China, that were set to take place there between Feb. 8 and Feb. 9. The federation cited "the outbreak of the coronavirus" as the reason for the postponement.
Several qualifiers for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo that were scheduled for February are now set to take place outside China. Among the affected sports are boxing, basketball and soccer.
Several other major sporting events are at risk of being impacted by the spread of the coronavirus, including Shanghai's Formula One Grand Prix in April.

5:25 AM: India asks people to refrain from China travel
NEW DELHI — India on Wednesday joined a growing list of countries that have issued advisories against travel to China as the deadly coronavirus spreads. The Ministry of Health in a brief statement asked Indians to "refrain" from traveling to China in view of the spurt in coronavirus cases.
IndiGo, the country's largest airline, also announced flight suspensions because of the situation. It suspended its flights between New Delhi and Chengdu from Feb. 1 to Feb. 20 and other flights from Bengaluru to Hong Kong. The airline said the measures are "temporary and precautionary."
Government-run airline Air India canceled its flights to Shanghai from Mumbai and Delhi until Feb. 14.
Authorities in India are in talks with the Chinese government to evacuate Indian citizens in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. Indian nationals in the region were asked to fill out an evacuation consent form, which mandates that on return to India, they will undergo a 14-day quarantine. The form also asks for self-declaration of symptoms associated with coronavirus.

4:40 AM: Two new coronavirus cases confirmed in Australia
HONG KONG — Two more coronavirus cases have been reported in Australia, bringing to seven the number of people in the country confirmed as having the virus that originated in central China.
Brett Sutton, the chief health officer of Victoria state, told reporters Wednesday that one case involved a resident in his 60s who became unwell Thursday after traveling to Wuhan. He had since recovered.

Hours later, authorities in Queensland state said a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan, the city at the focus of the outbreak, was confirmed to have the virus. He was reported to be in stable condition in isolation at Gold Coast University Hospital.
Meanwhile, the Chinese women's national soccer team was being held in quarantine at a Brisbane hotel, according to reports. A total of 32 people, including players and staff, traveled through Wuhan a week ago, Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said.

4:25 AM: Australian researchers grow coronavirus for first time outside China
BERLIN — Researchers with the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne announced on Wednesday that they have grown the coronavirus from a patient sample, potentially paving the way for more scientific breakthroughs.
It was the first time such an experiment had succeeded outside of China, the scientists said. They hope that the sample — set to be shared with laboratories around the world — will help to speed up efforts to develop a vaccine and to diagnose the virus in patients without symptoms.
"Chinese officials released the genome sequence of this novel coronavirus, which is helpful for diagnosis," Julian Druce, a Royal Melbourne Hospital researcher, was quoted as saying in a release by the University of Melbourne.
However, "having the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities — it will be a game changer for diagnosis," he added.

4:05 AM: Two cases confirmed in Hong Kong, as total rises to 10
HONG KONG — Authorities in Hong Kong on Wednesday said they had confirmed two new positive cases of the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the Chinese territory to 10. The two are an elderly couple in their 70s who are from the city of Wuhan where the virus was first discovered.
The couple, health authorities said, arrived in Hong Kong on Jan. 22 and spent a night in a hotel. They were sent to the hospital six days later, and were likely to have eaten at various restaurants and visited several areas across the city.

The new confirmed cases are likely to fuel criticism that Hong Kong authorities acted too slowly in banning travelers from Wuhan and Hubei province more broadly. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday announced measures that she hoped would lead to a "drastic" reduction of travelers from the mainland, including shutting down several border crossings, canceling individual visitor visas and slashing flights from the mainland, but stopped short of closing the border.

3:14 AM: Total number of coronavirus cases in China surpasses SARS epidemic
TOKYO — The number of coronavirus cases in mainland China has now overtaken the total recorded during the 2002-3 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, although the death toll remains much lower.
Official Chinese government statistics show 5,974 confirmed cases in mainland China, with more than 9,000 suspected cases, 132 deaths and 103 people cured. Adding in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and 15 other countries, the total of confirmed cases tops 6,000.
The SARS outbreak saw 5,327 people infected in mainland China and 349 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

But SARS also hit 1,755 people in Hong Kong and killed 299 people there, and spread to more than two dozen other countries. In total it is thought to have affected 8,096 people and killed 774, according to WHO data,
The data underlines just how quickly the latest coronavirus has spread and the problems involved in getting it under control, experts say, especially with many believing the true number of infected people in China could be significantly higher than the official data show.
SARS was also a form of coronavirus thought to have originated in bats and passed onto humans through another animal.

3:00 AM: China and Russia to cooperate on developing coronavirus vaccine
MOSCOW — China has handed over the genome of the coronavirus to Russia in a joint effort between the two countries to create a vaccine, the Russian Consulate in Guangzhou said in a statement Wednesday.
Russia has not had any confirmed cases of the new virus, but its consumer safety regulator, Rospotrebnadzor, said it started work on a vaccine a week ago.
"Yes, of course, the development of a vaccine is underway. Every time we have a mutation (of a virus), we start developing a vaccine immediately," Anna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor, told Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency.
German Shipulin, the deputy director of the Health Ministry's strategic planning center, told the Izvestia newspaper that a vaccine will require a significant allocation of funds and take at least six months to develop.
"We do not know how this virus will behave among our population. … The susceptibility of the population to it depends on genetics. But if the virus does get to Russia and starts to spread with a large number of lethal outcomes, this vaccine will become a savior," he said.

2:43 PM: British Airways suspends flights to China
HONG KONG — British Airways on Wednesday suspended direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai following the coronavirus outbreak in China.
The move came after Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised against all but essential travel to mainland China, excluding Hong Kong and Macao, and urged against all travel to Hubei province, the center of the health crisis.
The London-based airline typically operates one direct flight a day to Beijing and another to Shanghai. Searches of its website showed they were no longer available, though indirect routings to both cities were still possible via connecting flights.

2:07 AM: Malaysia arrests man for spreading 'false information' on coronavirus
HONG KONG — Malaysian authorities have detained a man for spreading false news on the coronavirus, as authorities across the region battle a deluge of misleading information that has stoked panic.
The Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission, in a statement on Wednesday, said the 34-year-old man was detained for "spreading false information on Jan. 26 regarding the virus." His mobile phone and SIM card were also seized.
The "stern action," the commission said, is part of an effort to "control the spread of unlawful news about the novel coronavirus outbreak by irresponsible individuals that could disrupt national stability and public order."
Neighboring Singapore has also invoked a controversial new law against fake news on two separate occasions in relation to misinformation about the virus, including a false claim that a Singaporean had died after contracting it.
The spread of misinformation related to the virus has been widespread, with many believing videos stating that the virus came from the consumption of bat soup.
The viral video, which features a woman eating bat, was not filmed in Wuhan or anywhere else in mainland China, but in Palau. Within China, conspiracy theories that the disease was manufactured by Americans have also spread.

2:02 AM: WeChat sets up project to dispel rumors, warns users
NEW DELHI — WeChat, China's popular messaging and social media app, said in a statement that it was setting up a special project to "clean up the rumors" on coronavirus and "refute" them in real time.
As cases of the deadly virus spiked to nearly 6,000 in mainland China, so have rumors and misinformation adding to the panic.
The company said it would suspend accounts publishing incorrect information, temporarily or permanently. The company also threatened users with criminal action citing national laws under which people can be imprisoned, detained or be put under public surveillance if they are caught fabricating "false danger, epidemic situation, disaster situation."
Describing the current condition as an "epidemic," it urged users to remain "calm and rational" and rely on information from credible news outlets and the government. In a rare instance of transparency, the Chinese government declared it would post information on a daily basis on the outbreak and control measures.
Cases of coronavirus, first detected in China's Wuhan, have been recorded in 17 countries.

1:50 AM: Plane carrying American evacuees from Wuhan lands in Alaska
HONG KONG — A plane carrying as many as 240 American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan has landed in the United States.
The U.S. government chartered the aircraft to retrieve American diplomats and others from the central Chinese city that is at the heart of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.

The plane made a refueling stop in Alaska, where the passengers would undergo a health screening, and would then head for southern California, the Associated Press reported. The aircraft is expected to land at March Air Reserve Base in California's Riverside County, instead of at Ontario International Airport as originally planned.
The report cited Ontario airport commissioner Curt Hagman as saying the State Department had decided to divert the flight to the air base.

1:40 AM: Beijing shuts universities and schools indefinitely as China virus fears mount
TOKYO — Beijing's municipal government has indefinitely postponed the reopening of universities, schools and kindergartens as a precaution against the deadly coronavirus.
The school holiday was already extended for two weeks until Feb. 17, but the start of the spring semester has now been put off indefinitely, the government said.
Similar measures are being taken all over the country after the Ministry of Education issued instructions on Monday to postpone the new semester, saying that a new start time should be decided by local education departments in coordination with the local Communist Party and government.
"Schools of all kinds should strengthen the guidance for students' study and life during the winter vacation, and require that they do not go out at home, do not party, do not organize and participate in concentrated activities," the Ministry of Education said.

Leading international schools in the capital followed suit, with the French International School of Beijing telling parents it had received instructions "asking all students and school staff to remain confined to their homes in Beijing until further notice."
The International School of Beijing said it did not expect to reopen on Feb. 17 and the campus would need to remain closed for a longer period.
"We expect that upon returning to Beijing all students and employees will need to complete a 14-day travel quarantine period before returning to school," it said.
The Western Academy of Beijing issued similar instructions.
"Today we have received a new notice from the Beijing Municipal Education Commission (BMEC) announcing that the reopening of school campuses and start of regular school activities shall now be determined by them," it told parents. "This means that our online learning will continue beyond February 17, the same as Chinese kindergartens, schools, and universities."

1:15 AM: Coronavirus outbreak spreads to the Middle East
HONG KONG — The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday confirmed the first cases of the new coronavirus in the Middle East, according to reports.
The virus was detected among a family that arrived from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak, the state-run WAM news agency reported, citing a Health Ministry statement. It was not immediately clear how many people had been diagnosed.
The UAE is a major travel hub and is home to Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest international airport by passenger traffic, as well as long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad.

12:53 AM: Four Japanese evacuees taken to hospital for coronavirus checks
TOKYO — Four Japanese citizens who arrived in Tokyo from the virus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan on Wednesday showed symptoms of coughing and/or fever and have been admitted to a hospital for further checks, officials said.
The three men and one woman were taken to a hospital in the capital specializing in infectious diseases, traveling in separate ambulances, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. They were among 206 Japanese citizens who arrived back in the country on Wednesday as the evacuation of foreigners from the Chinese city at the center of the epidemic got underway.


At Tokyo's Haneda airport, Takeo Aoyama, an employee at a Nippon Steel subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters he was relieved to return home, the Associated Press reported.
"We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly and we were still in the city," Aoyama said, his voice muffled by a white surgical mask.
Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said on Tuesday that around 650 Japanese citizens living in the central province of Hubei had asked to return to Japan, adding that the government was making arrangements to lay on additional charter flights.

12:15 AM: North Korea calls fight against coronavirus a matter of 'national existence'
TOKYO — North Korea's ruling party newspaper called the fight against coronavirus a matter of national existence on Wednesday, as concerns rise that the nation's rudimentary health-care system would not be able to cope with a serious outbreak of the disease.
North Korea banned foreign tourists from entering the country last week, and tightened those controls this week by issuing instructions that any foreigner entering the country, including diplomats and aid workers, would be quarantined for a month, in "international class" hotels under medical supervision.
"All party organizations should regard efforts of blocking the spread of the new coronavirus as an important political matter that has to do with national existence and strengthen political activity," the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North's ruling party, said, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.
The paper also urged party organizations to make "active efforts" toward medical supervision, diagnosis and research and development on treatments for the virus.
The measures mirror steps taken by the country during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). During the ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014, entry requirements were even stricter, with anyone entering the country, including North Korean nationals and regime officials, held in quarantine for 21 days.
The latest measures will be a blow to North Korea's struggling economy, which had been relying in part on a big influx of Chinese tourists since last year to relieve the pain of international sanctions.

10:00 PM: Australia to evacuate some citizens from Wuhan and quarantine them on a remote island
HONG KONG — Responding to the deadly coronavirus outbreak, Australia said it would evacuate some of its nationals from Wuhan and hold them in quarantine on a remote island where the country has operated an immigration detention center.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the details Wednesday, adding that Australia had been working with the Chinese government to evacuate "isolated and vulnerable" Australians trapped in Hubei province, the epicenter of the health crisis.
The evacuees would be transferred to Christmas Island, an Australian territory hundreds of miles from the mainland in the Indian Ocean, where Australia has operated a controversial detention facility for asylum seekers.
It wasn't immediately clear how many people would be evacuated, though officials have said about 600 Australians have registered as being in Hubei province. Priority would be given to the young and the elderly, Morrison told reporters in the Australian capital Canberra Wednesday.
"Anyone who under this plan is transported to Christmas Island would be there, we envisage, for up to 14 days," Morrison said. "But that will be subject to the medical advice we receive."

9:30 PM: Can the coronavirus be contained? Unknowns complicate U.S. response.
WASHINGTON — China has ordered an unprecedented quarantine of more than 50 million people. It has closed schools and shut down live animal markets. Airports across the globe are screening passengers coming from the world's most populous country.
But three weeks after the new coronavirus emerged as a health crisis, experts can't yet say whether these efforts will succeed at containing an infection that now threatens at least 15 countries.
Some early signs are discouraging: Six countries, including China, have confirmed human-to-human transmission of the infection. Those include four cases in Germany connected to a single person — a worrisome sign for containment of the disease. Cases in China continue to multiply, and 5 million residents of Wuhan, where the virus originated, have left the city, some of them surely carrying the disease.
But so far, the mortality rate is less than the rate of other severe respiratory coronaviruses. In China, where 5,974 people are infected, 132 have died through Tuesday. That is a high rate, but far less than the fatality rate of SARS and MERS. And countries like the United States that quickly began screening travelers, isolating sick people and tracing their contacts have just a handful of cases. There have been no fatalities outside China.
Public health officials said Tuesday that they are grappling with a long list of unknowns that will determine how successful they are in limiting the toll of the widening outbreak. Those questions include how lethal the virus may be, how contagious it is, whether it is transmitted by people who are infected but show no symptoms, and whether it can be largely contained in its country of origin.
Some experts are encouraged that no case outside China seems to be severe, and that no fatalities have been recorded outside China so far.

8:45 PM: Two college basketball games postponed after Miami (Ohio) students tested for coronavirus
WASHINGTON — Officials at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, have called off two college basketball games after administrators announced two students who had recently traveled to China were being tested for coronavirus.
One of the students visited the campus health center on Monday and exhibited flulike symptoms, prompting staff to test him and his travel companion, a university statement said. The two students are now isolated in their off-campus residences while they await their test results from the CDC.
The school's men's and women's basketball teams were set to face Central Michigan and Western Michigan, respectively, over the next two days, but the athletic department announced on Tuesday that those games would be postponed.
The statement was vague and did not mention why the games were being rescheduled, saying only that Miami's opponents had asked for the change. But Central Michigan's athletic director, Michael Alford, confirmed it was a coronavirus-related precaution.
"The health and safety of our student-athletes is always a top priority and, out of abundance of caution, it was decided to cancel tonight's men's basketball game," Alford said in a statement. "I appreciate the diligence that the staff at Miami have shown and this serves as a reminder of how serious these issues are."
One of the students tested was an international student, the school statement said. The university, a public institution in southwest Ohio, has about 25,000 students enrolled at four campuses. More than 80 percent of its 3,000 international students are from China.
Spring semester classes began on Monday, after a month-and-a-half-long break and winter term when many students traveled abroad. As news of the outbreak spread, the university contacted students to ask about their travels, Jayne Brownell, the vice president for student life, said at a Tuesday news conference.
"We are following all of those CDC and Department of Health guidelines," Brownell said. "We are in touch multiple times a day."

8:10 PM: White House warns airlines ban of all China-U.S. flights possible
WASHINGTON — The White House on Tuesday warned airlines that it may suspend all China-U.S. flights if the coronavirus outbreak become a bigger public health threat to the United States.
In a meeting with airline executives Tuesday afternoon, White House officials said they are not banning flights just yet, but said the U.S. government will assess the situation daily, leaving open the possibility of a ban on all flights from China, people familiar with the meeting said.
Airlines in recent days have already canceled hundreds of flights scheduled from China's Wuhan International Airport, giving U.S. health officials a brief respite as they focused on the logistics of rerouting U.S.-bound travelers from the region to one of five airports for special screening.
Travelers are being funneled to airports in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, where they are being screened for the virus. If cleared, they are allowed to continue to their final destination, officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The State Department has issued a Level 4 advisory for Wuhan, meaning "no American should travel to Wuhan while this virus continues to have impact," Vice President Pence said Monday. Later Monday, the State Department issued a Level 3 travel advisory for all of China, urging Americans to reconsider or postpone travel to any part of the country.
Public health officials continue to say the coronavirus poses a low risk to the American public, but say the enhanced screenings at airports are part of "proactive preparedness precautions."
Officials familiar with Tuesday's meeting with the airline executives said the White House made clear any decision to ban flights will be based on public health.

7:45 PM: Charter plane with more than 200 evacuated Japanese citizens lands in Tokyo
TOKYO — A charter plane carrying 206 Japanese from the Chinese city of Wuhan arrived at Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Wednesday morning, as the evacuation of foreign nationals from the coronavirus-hit city gets underway.
Television reports said two of the passengers are suffering from cough and/or a fever, and video showed more than a dozen ambulances lined up outside the airport.
Japanese officials say any passengers showing symptoms will be taken directly to a hospital specializing in infectious diseases, while the rest will be taken to another hospital and tested for signs of the virus.

The second group will then be allowed to go home but urged not to venture outdoors for two weeks during the incubation period of the virus, with health officials visiting them on a daily basis to monitor their condition.
But on social media and comments sections of news reports, many people asked why the rest of the group is not also being isolated.
"It's really hard to understand why they do not isolate the returnees for two weeks," one person commented. "If some are already coughing and feverish, are not the other 200 plus people who are with them subject to infection? Are they allow to go home without isolation? What about their family members? What about their school or workplace?"
Officials say more than 650 Japanese citizens have asked to be evacuated from the central province of Hubei, and other flights will be laid on as soon as possible.

7:15 PM: Number of confirmed cases in China rises by more than 1,000 overnight
WASHINGTON — The death toll in China continues to rise, as health agencies reported 26 more fatalities on Wednesday morning local time. As of about 6:30 a.m. in Beijing, coronavirus had killed 132 people — all but six of whom were from Hubei province, where the outbreak began, according to a tally from national and local health commissions.
The number of confirmed cases also rose dramatically, by more than 1,000, to 5,974, according to the Chinese health agencies, which also reported that 103 people have been successfully treated for the disease.
The day-over-day increase comes as countries scramble to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, the disease's epicenter, and as Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged international cooperation to stop its spread.
"The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide," Xi said, according to a Reuters report.
