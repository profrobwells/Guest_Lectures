 Each side is "cautiously optimistic," but for different reasons.
The presidential campaigns of former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris touted bullish takeaways from internal data in the final stretch of the 2024 campaign, but each side appears to be focused on different trends.
As public polls signaled a close race on Monday, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt made an appearance on Fox Business and said early voters in swing states are leaning toward the GOP ticket.
“Our internal polls have President Trump leading in every key battleground state,” Leavitt said. “We are cautiously optimistic about a big victory tomorrow night as long as everyone turns out to vote.”

Leavitt added that “early voting trends” indicate that people are going to the polls and the numbers seem to favor Republicans in “every” swing state.
She also suggested Democrats are struggling in certain areas, as “urban turnout is down compared to what it was in 2020” and “female turnout for Kamala Harris is down compared to those that turned out early for Joe Biden” in the 2020 election.
Leavitt concluded that “all signs point to a victory tomorrow night, but we’re not taking our foot off the gas. President Trump has four rallies in battleground states today. And we need everyone to get out and vote.”
Two senior advisors similarly told The Daily Wire that they are “cautiously optimistic” about the election.
As it turns out, Harris’ campaign is also feeling “cautiously optimistic,” NBC News Washington Correspondent Yamiche Alcindor reported over the weekend.

“Senior Harris campaign officials say their internal data show they are winning battleground voters who have made up their minds in the last week by double digits,” Alcindor added.
“Still, Harris is doing everything possible to avoid the Blue Wall crumbling like it did in 2016,” she continued, and therefore Harris was campaigning in the swing state of Michigan.
Alcindor said a Harris aide told her they have a “big operation” focused on Dearborn, which has a large Muslim community, amid uncertainty about whether they will turn away from the VP this election because of conflict in Gaza.
On Friday, RealClearPolitics reporter Philip Wegmann said on X a senior Harris campaign official claimed Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden “crystalized” the choice of swing state voters who made up their mind to back the VP in the last week.
