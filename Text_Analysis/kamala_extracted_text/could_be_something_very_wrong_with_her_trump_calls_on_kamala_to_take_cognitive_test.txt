 ‘Could Be Something Very Wrong With Her’: Trump Calls On Kamala To Take Cognitive Test

 "She is slow and lethargic in answering even the easiest of questions."
Former President Donald Trump said on Sunday night that Vice President Kamala Harris should take a “test on cognitive stamina and agility,” arguing that her “slow and lethargic” answers during interviews are concerning.
Trump called on Harris, 59, to pass a cognitive test after the Democratic presidential nominee released a medical report on Saturday, which stated that she has “the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.” Harris used her medical report to attack Trump, suggesting that the 78-year-old former president is hiding whether he is fit for office.
Trump fired back, writing on Truth Social, “I believe it is very important that Kamala Harris pass a test on Cognitive Stamina and Agility. Her actions have led many to believe that there could be something very wrong with her.”
“Even 60 Minutes and CBS, in order to protect Lyin’ Kamala, illegally and unscrupulously replaced an answer she had given, which was totally ‘bonkers,’ with another answer that had nothing to do with the question asked,” Trump added. “Also, she is slow and lethargic in answering even the easiest of questions. We just went through almost four years of that, we shouldn’t have to do it again!”
Harris was slammed by conservatives, including Trump, for dodging questions on illegal immigration during her “60 Minutes” interview last week, an interview from which the news show still has not released the transcripts. U.S. senators and former CBS reporters have called on “60 Minutes” to release the transcripts after the news show was blasted for appearing to edit the interview with Harris in a way that helped her.
The Trump campaign responded to Harris’ calls for Trump to release more medical records by pointing to a doctor’s report from last November along with “detailed reports” on Trump’s recovery following the assassination attempt on him in July.
In November of 2023, Trump released a three-paragraph letter from his doctor which stated that the former president’s “overall health is excellent,” adding that his “cognitive exams were exceptional.” Trump campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement on Saturday, “President Trump has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician, as well as detailed reports from Dr. Ronny Jackson who treated him after the first assassination attempt. All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief.”
Dr. Jackson is a Republican congressman representing Texas and served as White House physician during the Obama and Trump administrations.
