Article Text:
 Less than 15 minutes of the 45 minute interview was released by CBS News.
The overwhelming majority of Americans want CBS News to release the full transcript of their “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris after the network was widely accused of deceptively editing Harris’ answers.
A staggering 85% of voters — including 88% of Republicans and 87% of Democrats — said that they think CBS News should release the full transcript of the interview, while only 15% said it should not release it.
53% said that they believed that the interview was edited to make Harris “look better,” while 47% said that they believed the interview was “fair and objective.”

The findings come after the Associated Press reported that the “60 Minutes” interview with Harris was 45 minutes long and was cut down to fit a 20-minute segment that aired on television and separate 6-minute segment that was posted to social media.

However, less than 15 minutes of the interview was aired between the two segments, meaning that less than one out of every three minutes of film was shown to the public.
The Trump campaign, top U.S. Senators, former CBS News journalists, and various publications have all called for the program to release the full footage and transcript of the interview, but they refuse to do so.
In fact, the show has largely avoided answering any questions about it.
The moment that sparked controversy on the show happened when host Bill Whitaker was discussing with Harris the United States’ financial support for Israel in its war against genocidal Islamic terrorists in the region.
“But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening,” Whitaker said to Harris.
In a promotional clip that was posted by CBS News on Sunday, Harris responded to that statement from Whitaker by saying: “The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.”
However, when the full interview was published by the network, that statement from Harris was nowhere to be found. Those words were not included anywhere in the television broadcast, nor did they appear in the interview when it was posted on YouTube, the interview’s transcript, or the show’s “Overtime” segment.
Instead, on television and in the interview posted online, Whitaker’s identical statement that “it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening” is followed by Harris saying: “We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”
