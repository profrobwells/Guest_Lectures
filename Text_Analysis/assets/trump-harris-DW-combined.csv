We‚Äôre right back where we started, ‚ÄúTrump is Hitler.‚Äù They just can‚Äôt keep away from it. And when they first trotted Kamala Harris out in what was nothing short of a coup against President Biden, replacing him with her at the top of the ticket, I think they thought she was going to emerge as some sort of phoenix from the ashes of the Democratic Party ‚Äì as if we had never met Kamala Harris before, as if we didn‚Äôt know who she was. They really acted like this was a person no one had ever met. I think they believed that she was going to invigorate the base so powerfully that they could retire the ‚ÄúTrump is Hitler; Trump is a fascist; Trump is a threat to democracy.‚Äù Now that they are seeing she is actually just the Kamala Harris that we all know from her forays into politics over the last two decades, they‚Äôve fallen back on what they think is their winning argument, which is ‚ÄúTrump is Hitler,‚Äù ‚Äî which they had sort of promised to do away with, I think, in the wake of the first assassination attempt on his life. It really does smack of desperation, the fact that these are all unnamed sources; the fact that the allegations are exactly the same. The Atlantic had an article a couple weeks ago arguing Trump is Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, right? They‚Äôre trying to up the ante. And, of course, it‚Äôs so depressing because what it does is cheapen the impact Hitler actually had in this world. It cheapens who these people were, Mussolini and Stalin, by comparing them to somebody who‚Äôs, at the end of the day, a patriot and somebody who just wants the best for his country. I think we‚Äôre really seeing, both on the Left and on the Right, an inability to comprehend why Hitler was that bad. That‚Äôs really what we‚Äôve gotten to.

"2082","race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","BATYA: It‚Äôs interesting, because what we‚Äôre really seeing here is the class divide mapping onto the gender divide. Harris is appealing to college educated women and Donald Trump is appealing to working class men. Of course, this has a lot to do with the aesthetics of the campaign. You mentioned Trump at McDonald‚Äôs and what I found so amazing about that moment was he showed up in his suit and did not take off his tie. He put the McDonald‚Äôs apron over the costume of Donald Trump. I think what that really showed was that he did not think this was a degraded job. He did not think that you had to sort of dress down and be humiliated to take this job. He acted the part of a McDonald‚Äôs worker with a lot of dignity. And I think that is why people really responded to that image of him. He looked proud to be doing it. He looked happy to be doing it. And I really cannot think of another politician who could have pulled that off in that way. He stands with workers and you see the way in which his economic policy is designed for the working class: No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on social security. He promised he would reduce the corporate taxes of any company that reshores manufacturing from 21% to 15%. This is going to encourage radical reshoring of manufacturing. He said he‚Äôs going to appoint a czar to entice American businesses back to the United States. Of course, women work in factories. Of course, women do service industry jobs. Of course, women work jobs that have overtime. But they are jobs that require physical brawn and physicality, the kinds of jobs that used to deliver the American dream before the Democrats became the party of the college educated. Meanwhile you look at the Harris campaign and she really is targeting that female college educated sector of the population ‚Äî people who have less economic insecurity, less economic struggle. People who are very, very invested in the question of abortion, honestly, to an extent that does not represent where the vast majority of Americans are at, the middle and the working class, who have a much more moderate view on abortion. This idea that abortion should be legal in all cases is very correlated with whether or not you have a college degree, and of course, women today in America are 15 points more likely to have that college degree. So it really reflects the way the Democrats have created an economy that really rewards women in a very big way.",71,2024-10-26,"https://www.dailywire.com/news/race-to-the-middle-which-candidate-resonates-more-with-middle-america","./kamala_extracted_text/race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","harris"

The elites have more money and more time and more commitment as a result of that privilege to showing up and voting. So it was a very smart thing for her to do. Even though Donald Trump has promised that he would veto a national abortion ban, the Democrats are a much more natural party for people who believe in late-term abortions because Democratic politicians are unwilling to say what the upper limit on the right to an abortion should be. They refuse to give that. So even though it is Republicans whose view at this point, namely Donald Trump, reflects more where the American people are at because of this question of the bans that she has been able to, I think, successfully tar Republicans with, she‚Äôs really been able to mobilize that elite, over-credentialed, educated female vote.",71,2024-10-26,"https://www.dailywire.com/news/race-to-the-middle-which-candidate-resonates-more-with-middle-america","./kamala_extracted_text/race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","harris"

"2088","race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","BATYA: Absolutely. About one month in, she came out with an economic agenda she‚Äôs been calling an ‚Äúopportunity economy.‚Äù And she had three main promises. The first was a massive investment in small businesses by way of tax cuts. People have sort of poked holes in that and said, ‚ÄúWell, a tax cut for a new business is not really going to help those people because they‚Äôre not going to have a lot of revenue those first few years,‚Äù which means that a tax cut is not going to help them very much. The second plank, she promised a $25,000 tax cut for first time homeowners, as well as cutting a lot of regulation around housing. And I think that that was actually a very smart plan from the cutting deregulation point of view, because, of course, we need much more housing. The reason people are finding it so hard to buy a home is just a sheer lack of supply. The problem with giving a $25,000 tax cut to first time homeowners is that it will increase demand. So there‚Äôs a real problem there. The experts on housing have said this is actually only going to make the problem worse because when you‚Äôre doing that you‚Äôre actually making more people able to buy homes, which means that this dwindling stock is going to become even more expensive. And the third idea that she had was just cribbed right from JD Vance, and it was a $6,000 tax cut for children for the first year of a child‚Äôs life. Of course, JD has said $5,000 and I believe it is unlimited for parents. So it was very interesting to me because from one point of view, this is not a great plan. It does reflect the Democrats overall view of how to help people who are struggling, which is instead of creating an economy that pays better to working class people, you sort of raise taxes on the rich and then redistribute that, which, of course, working class people don‚Äôt want that. They don‚Äôt want somebody else‚Äôs tax cuts. They don‚Äôt want welfare. They want much more of what Trump is offering, which is a protectionist economy, an economy that looks at the economy as a whole and says, ‚ÄùHow can we protect the labor of workers?‚Äù And Trump, of course, does that through tariffs, through, getting rid of free trade and then of course, through limiting the supply of labor through immigration control.",71,2024-10-26,"https://www.dailywire.com/news/race-to-the-middle-which-candidate-resonates-more-with-middle-america","./kamala_extracted_text/race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","harris"

She was sort of caught between a rock and a hard place because she was second in command in the Biden administration, which has been an absolute disaster for immigration. Opening the border and effectively allowing in 10 million undocumented immigrants to compete with Americans at the bottom end of the wage spectrum. And what‚Äôs actually worse is when they finally, finally ‚Äî after three and a half years ‚Äî decided to take executive action, what they did was create legal pathways to parole a whole bunch of people. So you don‚Äôt have the mess at the border anymore. They have actually paroled hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people into the country to compete legally with American workers. And of course, that is why this is happening. The gains that working class Americans had been seeing throughout the Trump presidency, and then in the post pandemic labor crunch, were halted immediately. And there‚Äôs just been precipitous wage losses now ‚Äî wage theft, to be honest, from working class people because of all of these paroled people. So the Haitians in Springfield are part of that group. They were paroled into the country by the Biden administration, I believe, because he thought that halting working class wage growth was the only way to tamp inflation down and to get that stigma off of his administration. So when Trump shows up and says, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre eating the cats, they‚Äôre eating the dogs, they‚Äôre eating the pets of the people in Springfield,‚Äù they‚Äôre probably not eating their cats and their dogs. They‚Äôre not doing anything to the pets. What they‚Äôre doing is they‚Äôre taking the jobs.

The unsuspecting Ukrainian Jews were ignorant of the Nazis‚Äô rabid anti-Semitism; until the invasion, Stalin had forbidden negative press re: Germany as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact.

Look at it this way, from our NBC polling, a merge of all of our data, those who voted in the 2020 presidential election and the 2022 midterms, Harris with a 6-point lead. The most reliable bloc of voters. Those who only voted in the 2020 presidential, that‚Äôs where Trump opens up a lead. And then those who didn‚Äôt vote in either, that‚Äôs where Trump has his biggest advantage over Harris. Are they actually going to vote this time around? Huge question mark. Another way to look at it, we asked folks, scale of 1 to 10: your interest in this election. Again, look at this. Those who rate it the highest, 9 or 10, race is tied. Seven or 8, pretty high, Harris is ahead. Here‚Äôs where Trump cleans up: those who say 1 to 6.

We‚Äôre right back where we started, ‚ÄúTrump is Hitler.‚Äù They just can‚Äôt keep away from it. And when they first trotted Kamala Harris out in what was nothing short of a coup against President Biden, replacing him with her at the top of the ticket, I think they thought she was going to emerge as some sort of phoenix from the ashes of the Democratic Party ‚Äì as if we had never met Kamala Harris before, as if we didn‚Äôt know who she was. They really acted like this was a person no one had ever met. I think they believed that she was going to invigorate the base so powerfully that they could retire the ‚ÄúTrump is Hitler; Trump is a fascist; Trump is a threat to democracy.‚Äù Now that they are seeing she is actually just the Kamala Harris that we all know from her forays into politics over the last two decades, they‚Äôve fallen back on what they think is their winning argument, which is ‚ÄúTrump is Hitler,‚Äù ‚Äî which they had sort of promised to do away with, I think, in the wake of the first assassination attempt on his life. It really does smack of desperation, the fact that these are all unnamed sources; the fact that the allegations are exactly the same. The Atlantic had an article a couple weeks ago arguing Trump is Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, right? They‚Äôre trying to up the ante. And, of course, it‚Äôs so depressing because what it does is cheapen the impact Hitler actually had in this world. It cheapens who these people were, Mussolini and Stalin, by comparing them to somebody who‚Äôs, at the end of the day, a patriot and somebody who just wants the best for his country. I think we‚Äôre really seeing, both on the Left and on the Right, an inability to comprehend why Hitler was that bad. That‚Äôs really what we‚Äôve gotten to.

"4555","race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","BATYA: It‚Äôs interesting, because what we‚Äôre really seeing here is the class divide mapping onto the gender divide. Harris is appealing to college educated women and Donald Trump is appealing to working class men. Of course, this has a lot to do with the aesthetics of the campaign. You mentioned Trump at McDonald‚Äôs and what I found so amazing about that moment was he showed up in his suit and did not take off his tie. He put the McDonald‚Äôs apron over the costume of Donald Trump. I think what that really showed was that he did not think this was a degraded job. He did not think that you had to sort of dress down and be humiliated to take this job. He acted the part of a McDonald‚Äôs worker with a lot of dignity. And I think that is why people really responded to that image of him. He looked proud to be doing it. He looked happy to be doing it. And I really cannot think of another politician who could have pulled that off in that way. He stands with workers and you see the way in which his economic policy is designed for the working class: No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on social security. He promised he would reduce the corporate taxes of any company that reshores manufacturing from 21% to 15%. This is going to encourage radical reshoring of manufacturing. He said he‚Äôs going to appoint a czar to entice American businesses back to the United States. Of course, women work in factories. Of course, women do service industry jobs. Of course, women work jobs that have overtime. But they are jobs that require physical brawn and physicality, the kinds of jobs that used to deliver the American dream before the Democrats became the party of the college educated. Meanwhile you look at the Harris campaign and she really is targeting that female college educated sector of the population ‚Äî people who have less economic insecurity, less economic struggle. People who are very, very invested in the question of abortion, honestly, to an extent that does not represent where the vast majority of Americans are at, the middle and the working class, who have a much more moderate view on abortion. This idea that abortion should be legal in all cases is very correlated with whether or not you have a college degree, and of course, women today in America are 15 points more likely to have that college degree. So it really reflects the way the Democrats have created an economy that really rewards women in a very big way.",51,2024-10-26,"https://www.dailywire.com/news/race-to-the-middle-which-candidate-resonates-more-with-middle-america","./trump_extracted_text/race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","trump"

The elites have more money and more time and more commitment as a result of that privilege to showing up and voting. So it was a very smart thing for her to do. Even though Donald Trump has promised that he would veto a national abortion ban, the Democrats are a much more natural party for people who believe in late-term abortions because Democratic politicians are unwilling to say what the upper limit on the right to an abortion should be. They refuse to give that. So even though it is Republicans whose view at this point, namely Donald Trump, reflects more where the American people are at because of this question of the bans that she has been able to, I think, successfully tar Republicans with, she‚Äôs really been able to mobilize that elite, over-credentialed, educated female vote.",51,2024-10-26,"https://www.dailywire.com/news/race-to-the-middle-which-candidate-resonates-more-with-middle-america","./trump_extracted_text/race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","trump"

"4561","race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","BATYA: Absolutely. About one month in, she came out with an economic agenda she‚Äôs been calling an ‚Äúopportunity economy.‚Äù And she had three main promises. The first was a massive investment in small businesses by way of tax cuts. People have sort of poked holes in that and said, ‚ÄúWell, a tax cut for a new business is not really going to help those people because they‚Äôre not going to have a lot of revenue those first few years,‚Äù which means that a tax cut is not going to help them very much. The second plank, she promised a $25,000 tax cut for first time homeowners, as well as cutting a lot of regulation around housing. And I think that that was actually a very smart plan from the cutting deregulation point of view, because, of course, we need much more housing. The reason people are finding it so hard to buy a home is just a sheer lack of supply. The problem with giving a $25,000 tax cut to first time homeowners is that it will increase demand. So there‚Äôs a real problem there. The experts on housing have said this is actually only going to make the problem worse because when you‚Äôre doing that you‚Äôre actually making more people able to buy homes, which means that this dwindling stock is going to become even more expensive. And the third idea that she had was just cribbed right from JD Vance, and it was a $6,000 tax cut for children for the first year of a child‚Äôs life. Of course, JD has said $5,000 and I believe it is unlimited for parents. So it was very interesting to me because from one point of view, this is not a great plan. It does reflect the Democrats overall view of how to help people who are struggling, which is instead of creating an economy that pays better to working class people, you sort of raise taxes on the rich and then redistribute that, which, of course, working class people don‚Äôt want that. They don‚Äôt want somebody else‚Äôs tax cuts. They don‚Äôt want welfare. They want much more of what Trump is offering, which is a protectionist economy, an economy that looks at the economy as a whole and says, ‚ÄùHow can we protect the labor of workers?‚Äù And Trump, of course, does that through tariffs, through, getting rid of free trade and then of course, through limiting the supply of labor through immigration control.",51,2024-10-26,"https://www.dailywire.com/news/race-to-the-middle-which-candidate-resonates-more-with-middle-america","./trump_extracted_text/race_to_the_middle_which_candidate_resonates_more_with_middle_america.txt","trump"

She was sort of caught between a rock and a hard place because she was second in command in the Biden administration, which has been an absolute disaster for immigration. Opening the border and effectively allowing in 10 million undocumented immigrants to compete with Americans at the bottom end of the wage spectrum. And what‚Äôs actually worse is when they finally, finally ‚Äî after three and a half years ‚Äî decided to take executive action, what they did was create legal pathways to parole a whole bunch of people. So you don‚Äôt have the mess at the border anymore. They have actually paroled hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people into the country to compete legally with American workers. And of course, that is why this is happening. The gains that working class Americans had been seeing throughout the Trump presidency, and then in the post pandemic labor crunch, were halted immediately. And there‚Äôs just been precipitous wage losses now ‚Äî wage theft, to be honest, from working class people because of all of these paroled people. So the Haitians in Springfield are part of that group. They were paroled into the country by the Biden administration, I believe, because he thought that halting working class wage growth was the only way to tamp inflation down and to get that stigma off of his administration. So when Trump shows up and says, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre eating the cats, they‚Äôre eating the dogs, they‚Äôre eating the pets of the people in Springfield,‚Äù they‚Äôre probably not eating their cats and their dogs. They‚Äôre not doing anything to the pets. What they‚Äôre doing is they‚Äôre taking the jobs.

That‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs answer when people ask him, ‚ÄúHow are you going to get inflation down?‚Äù And he says, I think accurately, ‚ÄúEnergy is one of the biggest drivers of inflation.‚Äù Because, of course, there‚Äôs energy at stake in everything to do with groceries, everything to do with food, whether it‚Äôs growing it, transporting it, feeding cattle ‚Äî everything. The cost of energy is going to be a huge driver in the cost of everything else. Trump wants to ‚Äúdrill baby drill.‚Äù He wants to use every method available.
