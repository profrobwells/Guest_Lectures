When Donald Trump first entered the political scene almost a decade ago, I did not like him. That is a generous way of putting it. I really did not like him. The only thing I knew about Trump at the time, aside from the fact that he was a reality TV star, was that he was a longtime Democrat from New York who was friends with all of the worst people in media and politics. All of those people hate him today and openly root for his political and physical demise. But that wasn’t the case in the early days of Trump’s political life. So, back in those days, I thought Trump was a leftist infiltrator. I thought that, no matter what he promised, he would govern from the Left. I thought that electing him would be the same as electing a far-Left Democrat — because that’s what he was, I believed. It turns out, I was wrong. Not for the first time. Sadly, not for the last. But I was wrong. Trump did not govern like a Democrat infiltrator sent by the Clintons to destroy the Republican Party from within (a conspiracy theory that, I admit, I once entertained). If he did, they wouldn’t have spent the last four years trying to send him to prison, or failing that, to the morgue. If I had fallen into a coma in January of 2017, missed the entirety of Trump’s tenure, and woken up in January of 2021, I would still know that Trump was a successful conservative president based entirely on how they’ve treated him ever since. Indeed, I would have all the reason that I needed to vote for him on that basis alone. They have tried to destroy him. Leftist elites have waged a campaign of vengeance unlike anything ever seen in the history of American politics. That’s reason enough to vote for him in 2024. I don’t need to know what happened from the years 2017 to 2021. But I do know, because I was thankfully alive and conscious during that time. So I saw that Trump fulfilled his promise to appoint constitutionalist justices to the Supreme Court, who then went on to overturn the most abominable decision in the history of the court — a decision that cost 60 million American lives. I saw that Trump enforced our immigration laws, defunded sanctuary cities, and sent criminal illegal aliens to prison. I saw that Trump’s time in office was also a time of relative peace all over the globe. He prevented wars rather than starting them — a novel strategy, at least compared to every other president in my lifetime. And I saw that Trump presided over a strong and growing economy. The unemployment rate hit a low not seen in 50 years. Manufacturing jobs started coming back to America. The stock market hit record highs. I saw all of that. We all saw it, if we were paying attention. Here’s what we didn’t see: any of the dystopian horrors that Trump’s opponents keep warning he will visit upon us. He did not govern like a fascist tyrant drunk on his own power. He did not install himself as dictator for life. In fact, he exercised great restraint. He didn’t start any new wars. He didn’t move to expand his own executive powers. He didn’t even issue that many executive orders, compared to the three most recent presidents before him. That’s why I’m voting for Trump. And why I believe you should too. He earned our vote. He earned it by governing successfully and leading competently. Trump was already a good president, which is very compelling evidence that he will be a good president. Nothing is sure in this life. You cannot predict the future with absolute certainty. Yet you can be extremely confident that someone can do a job well if they have already done it well. So that’s the best selling point for Donald Trump. The best selling point is who he is and what he has done. But the second best selling point is who he isn’t. He isn’t Kamala Harris. I’m voting for Trump because we need him in the White House. I’m also voting for him because we need to keep Kamala Harris out of the White House. I’m not going to spend a lot of time making the case against Kamala here. I’ve done that literally every day for the past three months. I suspect that anyone who reads this, anyone who is even potentially reachable at this stage of the game, already knows that Kamala is bad — a bad leader, a bad Vice President, a bad person. Totally unqualified for the job she currently holds. Even less qualified for the job she wants to hold. She is a far-Left radical. No matter how much she has backtracked over the past couple of months, her record speaks for itself. She wants to open our borders, defund our police, start more wars, kill more babies, take more money out of our pockets, destroy our right to free speech, make the world less safe and our communities less safe. She may be profoundly incompetent, but she is capable of doing all of those things. And she will. That’s the point I want to emphasize. Kamala Harris may be a bumbling, empty-headed buffoon. But she does have an agenda, she will use the powers of the presidency to enact it, and it will be a catastrophe for your family and mine. I would vote against Kamala Harris no matter who she was running against. I’d vote for a houseplant over her. We’ve already had one of those running the country for four years. It’s been a disaster, but Kamala will be worse. Kamala gives us more than enough reason to vote for Trump. But the good news is that we don’t have to hold our nose. We can vote against Kamala and for Trump, and do it proudly. On that note, I want to say one last thing. Trump’s critics like to say that character matters. They’re right. It does. They say we should think about Trump’s character before we consider voting for him. They’re right. We should. Well, there is no character trait more important than courage. CS Lewis once wrote that courage is the form of every virtue at its testing point. What he meant is that courage contains all of the other virtues. Courage is how all virtues are expressed when push comes to shove. If you are the most virtuous person in the world but all of your virtues disappear when you’re under fire, then you have no virtue. A man is defined by how he acts in those moments. So when you boil everything down, only one question matters: Do you have courage? That’s what separates the men who shape history from the ones who will be forgotten by it. That’s the dividing line. Now think about the iconic picture of Trump raising his fist in the air right after he was shot in the head. Most pictures are worth a thousand words. But I think for the best pictures you only need one. That picture of Trump screams one word: courage. Trump’s enemies may hate to admit it. They may never admit it. But Trump proved in that moment, and in the weeks and months that followed, that he is a man of exceptional courage. He was shot. A few weeks later, he was nearly shot again. It takes immense courage to continue along unfazed, still campaigning, still appearing in front of massive crowds, even after a bullet came half an inch from blowing a hole in your skull. The best thing I can say about Trump — the thing that most testifies to his character — is that if I had spent the month of July living in a cave, and only re-emerged in August, and had been following Trump closely ever since, I would never know that he escaped death by ten millimeters. That’s because the media has done everything they can to bury it and pretend it never happened. But it’s also because Trump is so completely unshaken by the event. He doesn’t come off like a man who just suffered a severe trauma, though he did. When you face down your own mortality and are not remotely rattled by the experience, and then you continue to put yourself in vulnerable positions because you simply refuse to run and hide, you have courage. You have shown a kind of courage that nobody in American politics today has ever shown. Trump’s relentlessly theatrical enemies have to invent all kinds of fantastical threats that they are supposedly facing. They pretend that Trump is some sort of existential danger to them. That their very lives hang in the balance. It’s all performance. The truth is that most of them are living lives of great comfort. And the irony is that, if Trump wins, their lives will only become more comfortable as the economy improves. They are not facing down any threat. They are not showing any courage. They don’t know what courage is. They’re on the same side as Hollywood and the media and corporate America and almost every powerful person in DC. They are safe. Trump is the one under fire. Trump has actually taken a bullet in real life. It’s not a performance for him. Trump is not a perfect man. Neither am I. Neither are you. But what I know is that when the bullets were flying, he stood tall. That’s the kind of man I want in the White House. It’s the kind of man we’ll need in the times ahead.

PALM BEACH—Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is circulating a memo describing a “massive turnout deficit” for Democrats on the eve of the 2024 election. Tim Saler, the chief data consultant for Donald J. Trump for President, described how Trump and Republicans are reportedly outperforming past elections in early votes and absentee ballots in a memo sent to Trump campaign senior leadership on Monday. “As we dive deeper into the data, Democrats are facing a precipitous decline in urban turnout according to their own ‘data experts’ and we are tracking an uptick in rural turnout,” Saler wrote. He cited Barack Obama’s former campaign manager, Jim Messina, who described the early vote numbers as “a little scary” on MSNBC. “The early vote numbers are a little scary,” said Messina, a 2012 Obama aide. “Republicans didn’t do what they did last time. “Last time, Trump said, ‘Don’t early-vote,’ so they didn’t,” he added. “Republicans do have an advantage in early-vote numbers. When the early votes come in, it’s going to look a little bit different than 2020, and that’s scary.” “What Mr. Messina is downplaying, is they are a lot scarier for Democrats,” Saler said. “According to NBC News, President Donald J. Trump has a 16-point lead (56-40) among voters who plan to cast their ballot on Election Day. Obama’s chief campaign strategist and CNN political commentator, David Axelrod, told CNN that there are no guarantees that voters will turn out on Election Day for Vice President Harris.” “Democrats are spinning themselves and reporters by claiming that their voters will turn out on Election Day when polls show otherwise and, most importantly, that’s asking Democrat voters to do something they have absolutely no history of doing,” he added. “If Democrats, who historically vote ahead of Election Day, haven’t been motivated to show up for Kamala yet, why do we expect them to show up tomorrow?” The memo emphasized confidence that Trump is heading into Tuesday “stronger than he has in any previous election.” But it also stressed that Republicans need to get out and vote for Trump. Saler added, “if patriots across the country keep the momentum and turn out as expected on Election Day, we will be swearing in President Trump in January.” The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump unveiled the new policy on Monday to a crowd of supporters in North Carolina, an important battleground state, saying the tariff has a “100%” chance of working. While most of the tariff plans Trump has previously touted on the campaign trail focus on rejuvenating American manufacturing, his promise on Monday centered on addressing the border crisis that has skyrocketed under the Biden-Harris administration, another top issue of the former president’s campaign. Trump said that “on day one or sooner,” he will inform Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, that if Mexico doesn’t “stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I’m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the United States of America.” “And it’s only got a 100% chance of working,” Trump added. “Because if that doesn’t work, I’ll make it 50 [percent]. And if that doesn’t work, I’ll make it 75 [percent] for the tough guys. I’ll make it 100 [percent]. And at some point, they’ll have so many soldiers on their southern border, you know, their southern border is where they come in.” Donald Trump proposes a 25% tariff on imported Mexican goods: ""If they don't stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I'm going to immediately impose a 25% tariff… It's only got a 100% chance of working because if that doesn't work, I'll make it 50."" pic.twitter.com/PTBzwZP9NK — The Recount (@therecount) November 4, 2024 In September while speaking at a town hall event in Flint, Michigan, Trump vowed to put a 200% tariff on vehicles manufactured outside of the U.S., saying he wants to bring more car manufacturing back to places like Flint and Detroit. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “They think they’re going to make their cars there and they’re going to sell them across our line and we’re going to take them and we’re not going to charge them tax. We’re going to charge them. I’m telling you right now, we’re putting a 200% tariff on them, which means they’re unsellable,” Trump said. “And then you wonder why I get shot at,” he added. “You know, only consequential presidents get shot at. … But you have to do what you have to do.

"4","https://www.dailywire.com/news/these-celebrities-say-theyre-voting-for-trump","These Celebrities Say They’re Voting For Trump","From Hollywood to the world of sports, these are the stars who said they're voting Republican. While most celebrities who mention politics vote blue no matter who the candidate is, there are several famous faces who have come out in support of Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. The biggest name on that list is billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has become a staunch Trump supporter in addition to saving one of the biggest social media platforms in the world from leftist censors. Musk has been on the campaign trail with Trump and frequently reminds X followers why they should support the former president. “Unless [Trump] wins, this will be the last election,” Musk shared on Sunday. “The Dems will legalize all the illegals in swing states, so there [will] be no more swing states.” “America will become a one-party, deep blue socialist state,” the post continued. The Tesla founder has given at least $132 million to boost Trump and other Republicans this cycle, including more than $50 million in recent weeks. Musk also predicted that Trump would beat Kamala Harris in a “crushing defeat.” YouTube star Jake Paul also came out in support of Trump with a twenty-minute-long video explanation he shared on the platform. The professional boxer pointed to the “number of problems that America” is currently facing, which he said included “wars, health, guns, jobs, economy, inflation, border control, freedom of speech.” “I think we can all agree that things just don’t feel right; America doesn’t feel good,” Paul said. “It shows that we are more divided than ever, and I can’t just sit back and watch this blasphemy unfold in front of me any longer.” Actor Dennis Quaid, who just played Ronald Reagan in a biopic, also said he’s supporting Trump. “It just makes sense,” the star said in May. “I was ready not to vote for Trump, until what I saw is, more than politics, I see a weaponization of our justice system and a challenge to our Constitution.” “Trump is the most investigated person, probably in the history of the world, and they haven’t been able to really get him on anything,” he added. “Sopranos” actress Drea de Matteo said she’s voting for Trump and she’s not the only one. “The people I’m around, a lot of liberals are voting for Trump. I think half of Hollywood is actually voting for Trump,” she told Variety. “I know that I’ve gotten plenty of messages in my inbox: ‘Thank you for saying things I can’t say.’” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Actor Zachary Levi said Hollywood stars need to speak up about their choice. The “Shazam!” actor said Harris “is not qualified in any way shape or form to be the Commander in Chief, the leader of the free world. Absolutely not.” He echoed de Matteo, saying many celebrities who support Trump are afraid to say so publicly. “They’ve sent me lots of messages, plenty of people in Hollywood, who are terrified to publicly say they would vote for Donald Trump or be conservative in any way. They know there’s ramifications for this kind of s***,” he said. Levi added, “But ya’ll, our industry is going to be f***ing gonzo. My cry to all of you out there, you closeted Trump voters, it’s now or never…If you need to come out publicly and say it…know that if what you’re afraid of is somehow the backlash of an industry that’s not going to exist very soon, then don’t let that hold you back.” One celebrity who makes no secret of being conservative is Kelsey Grammer, who endorsed the Republican nominee again this year. The same goes for Jim Caviezel, “Orange is the New Black” actress Taryn Manning, country singer Jason Aldean, rapper Kodak Black, Lil Wayne, Trace Adkins, Kid Rock, UFC head honcho Dana White, Rob Schneider, Roseanne Barr, Dean Cain, Kevin Sorbo, James Woods, Jillian Michaels, and Jon Voight. Mel Gibson has never hid his conservative beliefs. In October, he said Harris has a “miserable track record” and “no policies to speak of.” The “Braveheart” actor also said the Democratic candidate has “the IQ of a fence post.” In the sports world, Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker supports Trump, and so does Brittany Mahomes, wife of the Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Danica Patrick does, too. Brett Favre endorsed Trump for president. Late last month, retired United States Air Force Brigadier General Buzz Aldrin, who is also a famed NASA astronaut, endorsed Trump and said he was pleased with the candidate’s interest in both space exploration and preserving the safety of the nation. “The Presidency requires an understanding of human nature, clarity in judgment, decisiveness, knowledge, understanding, and calm under pressures few have a natural ability to manage, or the life experience to successfully undertake,” Aldrin said as part of his endorsement. “It is a job where decisions are made that routinely involve American lives – some urgently but not without thought. The job requires sober analysis of frightening scenarios, and the instinct to lead with resolve.” “I wholeheartedly endorse him for President of the United States,” Aldrin said. “Godspeed President Trump, and God Bless the United States of America.” Already have an account?

"5","https://www.dailywire.com/news/joe-rogan-endorses-trump-for-president","Joe Rogan Endorses Trump For President","The endorsement comes after he interviewed Trump last month. Podcast giant Joe Rogan endorsed former President Donald Trump for president on Monday night after an interview with X owner Elon Musk. The endorsement from Rogan, one of the most influential figures with men in the United States, could be one of the rare political endorsements that actually helps move the needle. “The great and powerful @elonmusk,” Rogan said after the Musk interview. “If it wasn’t for him we’d be f***ed.” “He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way,” he continued. ” For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump.” The endorsement comes after Trump and vice presidential nominee JD Vance both sat for interviews with Rogan last month while Vice President Kamala Harris refused. Trump responded to the endorsement moments after Rogan announced it as he was campaigning during the final hours of the campaign in Pennsylvania. “So somebody that’s very, very respected asked me to do his show two weeks ago, and I said, why not?” Trump told the crowd. “And to me, it’s very big, because he’s the biggest there is, I guess, in that world by far, somebody said the biggest beyond anybody in a long time, and his name is Joe Rogan, and he’s never done this before.” “And it just came over the wires that Joe Rogan just endorsed me,” Trump continued. “Thank you, Joe!” Trump noted that Rogan tends to be “a little bit more liberal than some of the people in this room” but he still loved doing the three-hour interview.

The Trump campaign posted a flashback to Vice President Kamala Harris bashing saying, “Merry Christmas,” promising that a second Trump presidency would have Christmas cheer. “How dare we speak ‘Merry Christmas!’ How dare we!” Harris said in a 2017 speech during negotiations about protections for illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. The Trump Team TikTok account posted the old video of Harris and then cut to a clip of former President Donald Trump. “Well, guess what? We’re saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again,” Trump said in the clip. Team Trump posted this on TikTok one day ago. It has 30M views and 4.2M likes. pic.twitter.com/CqqUcMrLGP — End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) November 4, 2024 During his 2016 campaign, Trump promised that Americans would say “Merry Christmas” again if he won. “If I’m president, you’re going to see ‘Merry Christmas’ in department stores, believe me,” he said in a speech at the time. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again,” he said in another. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ The Trump Team’s TikTok was posted on Sunday, two days before the presidential election on Tuesday. Trump and Harris are currently tied nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. Trump holds a tiny lead in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, and Arizona. Harris holds a slight lead in Michigan and Wisconsin. During her 2017 remarks, Harris called it “morally wrong” to take Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status away from non-citizens. “When we all sing happy tunes and sing ‘Merry Christmas’ and wish each other ‘Merry Christmas,’ these children are not going to have a merry Christmas,” she said. “How dare we speak ‘Merry Christmas!’ How dare we! They will not have a merry Christmas. They don’t know if they will be here in a matter of days, weeks and months.” This election cycle, the Trump campaign and Republicans have zeroed in on immigration, one of their strongest issues, arguing that the Biden administration has allowed an unmitigated disaster at the border. Harris has hammered abortion, urging women especially to vote for her to preserve legal abortion. In the last few weeks, her campaign has also tried to boost support among men, which Democrats fear may be one of her biggest vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, Christmas is already in the air around the country. Retail stores have already begun to display their Christmas inventory and are decorating their stores in anticipation of the holiday season. The famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree has been selected and is set to arrive in Midtown Manhattan on Saturday. Already have an account?

There's only one Donald J. Trump."" Keith Schiller, who worked as Donald Trump’s bodyguard for years before becoming his Director of Oval Office Operations, told Daily Wire host Michael Knowles on Monday morning that the media’s description of Trump’s character is far from reality. During The Daily Wire’s “Election Wire” livestream, Knowles discussed Trump’s character with Schiller, a man who has been close to Trump for decades, serving as the director of security for the Trump Organization. “The media has been saying for a decade now … [Trump] is awful and he’s a man of terrible character and everyone hates him and he’s a terrible person to be around,” Knowles said. “You have the personal insight. Tell us about the man personally.” “The media has done a great job of building him up and knocking him down,” Schiller replied. “The truth is in the employees and the people he touches on a daily basis. He reaches out, he has rapport with long-term people that have been at his employ.” “If he were such a bad person, he couldn’t keep people around him,” Schiller added. “There’s people … who love him. He’s a man of the people.” Knowles brought up how even after becoming president, Trump always showed his appreciation for those serving around him, such as when he stopped before boarding Marine One to pick up a Marine’s hat that had blown off in the wind. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Schiller also said that Trump “knows how to connect with people” on the campaign trail, pointing to how his supporters will line up “for miles” to greet his motorcade. Even though Trump is wealthy, Schiller said there is a genuineness about him that makes it easy for him to connect with Americans from “all walks of life.” “He’s done that because he’s employed thousands upon thousands of people over the years, and he’s been able to get them behind them, make them feel a connection that’s so unique to him,” Schiller continued. “He’s a very unique gentleman, right?

"8","https://www.dailywire.com/news/my-closing-statement-why-i-voted-trump","My Closing Statement: Why I Voted Trump","There are essentially three reasons I support Donald Trump. So, it’s down to the wire. According to the latest RealClearPolitics polling average, Donald Trump is up in national polling — by 0.1%. In Georgia, he’s leading by 2.3%; in North Carolina, by 1.5%; in Pennsylvania, by 0.3%; in Arizona, by 2.6%; in Nevada, by 1%. Meanwhile, according to that same average, Harris is leading in Michigan by 0.6% and in Wisconsin by 0.3%. Suffice it to say, every single one of these battleground states is well within the margin of error — meaning that a significant polling error in Trump’s favor turns the election into a blowout for him, and a significant polling error in Harris’ direction turns it into a blowout for her. According to Atlas Intel, Trump is currently leading in all the swing states; according to New York Times/Siena, Trump is behind in Nevada, but ahead in Arizona, and all the other swing states are essentially dead even, with Harris up slightly in Georgia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. The bottom line: Nobody knows anything. As Nate Cohn of the New York Times points out, “Across these final polls, white Democrats were 16 percent likelier to respond than white Republicans. That’s a larger disparity than our earlier polls this year, and it’s not much better than our final polls in 2020 — even with the pandemic over. It raises the possibility that the polls could underestimate Mr. Trump yet again.” The early votes tell us … pretty much nothing. They show that the Republicans have done a far better job than in 2020 of getting out the early vote, but those may be high-propensity voters who were going to vote for Trump anyway. Meanwhile, female voters are, indeed, showing up in droves — but the same story applies. Everyone is now attempting to read chicken entrails. So when Ann Selzer, widely-respected as one of the best pollsters in the country, came out with a shocking poll on Saturday that had Kamala Harris leading Trump in Iowa by three points, Democrats erupted into spasms of ecstasy. At last, here was the evidence that Trump is finally going to be subdued, and Harris will emerge victorious! But, of course, it’s not quite that simple. The poll is pretty clearly an outlier. Emerson has Trump up nearly 10 points in the state right now. And Iowa is a Republican state at this point: The Republican Party has an advantage in registered voters over the Democratic Party of some 173,000 voters. Bottom line: We should take the Iowa poll with a grain of salt. As Nate Silver says, “Releasing this poll took an incredible amount of guts because — let me state this as carefully as I can — if you had to play the odds, this time Selzer will probably be wrong.” So, here’s the bottom line: Stop reading chicken entrails and GO VOTE NOW. On Friday, I voted early. And I voted, of course, for Donald Trump. Now, for the final time, let me explain why. I want to explain why I voted for Trump not to the ardent Trump voter — you already know the case for Trump, obviously. And I’m not explaining it to the person who believes Trump is a Hitlerian menace — if you believe that, nothing I say can reconnect you to reality. I’m addressing people who might have hold-ups about Trump on character but like his policy; people who think that Kamala Harris is a “change” candidate; people who are worried about the supposed “threat” to institutions from Trump, but aren’t crazy enough to stay up nights worrying about concentration camps or boxcars from a second Trump administration. For all of you who are wavering, I think it’s necessary to explain my reasoning. After all, I went from someone who didn’t vote for either Trump or Hillary in 2016 — my first time abstaining from a presidential vote ever because I felt both were unfit — to voting for Trump in 2020; to voting for, campaigning with, and giving money to Donald Trump in 2024. There are essentially three reasons I support Donald Trump: The first is Donald Trump, the second is Kamala Harris, and the third is the institutions. Let me begin by acknowledging many of the concerns of those of you who are hesitant about Donald Trump. As you know from listening to the show consistently, I don’t like a lot of the things Trump says. I’m not in love with his statements on TruthSocial about various controversies of the day. (I’m not voting because I care about his hot take on Taylor Swift.) I’m not big on the bulls******ry that Trump often bandies about with regard to topics large and small. I think the evidence is skimpy that there is widespread pet barbecuing in Springfield. But here’s the thing about Trump: Underlying a lot of the bulls*****ry is truth. Trump speaks in superlatives. He exaggerates for effect. He tells stories he’s half heard, and then repeats them in inflated fashion. But he’s generally right on the central point: Illegal immigration is out of control; the regulatory and tax regime of the Biden/Harris administration has generated historic inflation and burdened America with a future of economic stagnation; Biden and Harris are unprecedentedly cowardly and weak on foreign policy. And here’s the biggest thing: I’m not voting for Trump because I need a moral exemplar. I’m not a child. I’m an adult voter, and I have plenty of people I use as moral guides and sounding boards: my parents, members of my community, philosophers and thinkers. To me, politicians aren’t gods or great leaders — at least, not very often. They’re plumbers. The question is whether they’ll fix the toilet. Donald Trump fixes the toilet. Kamala Harris throws a cherry bomb in it. We don’t have to speculate about this. We know it’s true. Donald Trump has already been president. And he was a hell of a lot better than Kamala Harris has been as vice president. So let’s talk policy. Anti-Wokeness: Beginning with general governing worldview, Trump believes that America’s founding principles are great. He doesn’t believe that America was built on racism, sexism, bigotry, and homophobia. He believes that America is a land of opportunity for everyone — and that it should be. He doesn’t identify winning with exploitation or losing with victimhood. He doesn’t believe in any idiotic oppressor/oppressed matrix by which we can determine, solely based on someone’s failure, whether society has been mean to them. This is actually the great battle of our time. Because, as I will discuss, Harris is a devotee of wokeness: the belief that those who fail are oppressed, and those who succeed are oppressors. And that worldview means incentivizing failure and punishing success in every area of human life. Economic Meritocracy: Donald Trump generally believes in economic meritocracy. Trump is about winning. This, we all know. Like it or hate it, it’s his gauge of success. What that means is that he values merit. He wants an economy where innovators and entrepreneurs like Elon Musk are given the freedom to take us to Mars, not an economy where Kamala Harris’ Department of Justice sues Musk for failure to hire enough refugees or immigrants on new visas. He wants an economy where businesses are worried about creating the best goods, products, and services for the lowest price, not about the dumbest regulations coming from the EPA or the diversity, equity, and inclusion regime of the corporate office. This is why Trump wants lower taxes, less regulation, and more dynamic business as a result. What of his talk about tariffs? Yes, tariffs are generally bad policy. But Trump is transactional; he uses tariffs as a way to cudgel other countries to behave according to the basic rules of the road in international markets. Tariffs, he believes, are a great way of ensuring that countries like China don’t simply dump endless amounts of money into industries that threaten American safety while stealing American technology. And he’s not wrong. This is why Trump had a thriving economy: Wage growth beat inflation by 15%, and inflation grew at just 1.9% per annum. There is a reason people are nostalgic for the Trump economy. Foreign Policy: Because Trump is not a devotee of the evil oppressor/oppressed matrix, he knows that other countries have interests that are not ours. When Trump says “America First,” he doesn’t mean isolationism, as he himself told me; he doesn’t mean Charles Lindbergh or Father Coughlin. He means that America’s interests ought to be first and foremost — and that very often, those interests can be protected by the credible threat of use of force. Trump innately understands deterrence. I’ve told this story before, but it’s worth telling it again: When I held a fundraiser for Trump a few months ago, he told this story. He said: You want to know why Vladimir Putin never invaded Ukraine on my watch? Because I called him and I told him, “Vlad, Vlad, don’t you do it.” And Vlad said, “Why not, Mr. President?” And I said, “Because, Vlad, if you do, I’m gonna bomb the s*** out of you.” And he said, “No, you won’t, Mr. President.” And I said, “Well, I might!” And then Trump turned to me and said, “And you know what? If there’s even a five percent chance that the United States military, the most powerful military in the history of the world, is going to bomb the s*** out of you, you don’t do it.” Trump knew that innately. That’s why the world became far more peaceful under Trump. China, for the first time, saw that perhaps it didn’t have a patsy in Trump, and believe it or not, bipartisan opposition to Chinese aggression grew radically under Trump. Russia didn’t invade Ukraine under Trump, even though it did under Obama and Biden. And, of course, while Obama and Biden radically incentivized the growth of terror by Iran, it was Trump who contained Iran, impoverished it, and brokered the Abraham Accords. Trump gets it. So that’s the positive case for Trump. Now to the case against Kamala. Kamala Harris is not an important figure, in and of herself. She has been an empty vessel her entire political career. She’s quite bad at the game, actually: She couldn’t speak straight to the point if her life depended on it, instead spewing ghastly word vomit that would put the fat kid from the “Stand by Me” pie-eating contest to shame; she vacillates wildly between insane Leftism, as in her 2019 failed presidential campaign, to faux-hawkish tough-on-crime prosecutor, as she’s been trying to do this year. None of it washes. She’s totally insincere, utterly charmless, and terrifically inauthentic. She’s the “Polar Express” of political candidates, inhabiting the uncanny valley full-time. And she’s surrounded herself with other residents of the island of misfit, cloying and uber-irritating tools: Doug Emhoff, her nanny-impregnating, religious Jew-impersonating, ex-girlfriend allegedly slapping husband; Tim Walz, the pretend ultra-man, who pretends to be a gun fanatic but can’t properly load one, who play-acts at being a football coach but can’t even use the terminology properly; and all the rest. Of course, Harris wouldn’t be there if she weren’t just a tool of the Democratic machine. She was put in place in 2020 by Barack Obama and the rest of the Democratic upper echelon, who decided that Joe Biden needed a woman of color on the ticket; then, after failing dramatically as vice president in every job she was given, she was jabbed into the presidential nomination by the same machine, which suddenly realized that Biden’s brain had passed away some years before. She is not joy. She is not brat. She is an empty pantsuit. She always was. But that doesn’t mean she isn’t dangerous. Because, like Joe Biden, she’s actually just an inept weathervane for the Democratic Party as a whole. And that party has embraced the failure and radicalism of its most insane members. Pro-Wokeness: In regards to her worldview, Harris, like Biden before her, has said that “equity” ought to be at the center of all her policies. By equity, of course, she means equality of outcome. She has not been shy about this. She has said it repeatedly, in different contexts, for years. She truly believes that disparities are a result solely of discrimination. This means that any group that underperforms has been exploited by an evil system. The world is a system of oppressors and oppressed, and it is the job of the federal government to rectify those imbalances, both domestically and abroad. For some groups, no evidence need be shown to demonstrate victimization (say, women in the United States, who currently constitute a majority of college graduates) in order for that group to be labeled victimized; historic victimization will do. For others, even evidence of current victimization must be ignored (Asians and Jews), so long as members of those groups are disproportionately successful. This is an evil worldview; it incentivizes failure, it punishes success, and it treats people not as individuals but as members of classes. It is entirely anti-American. It tears Americans apart on the basis of identity. And no, it isn’t going away. She’s trying to hide it, but it’s the essence of her entire campaign, which treats women and men as enemies, ignores hatred of Jews so long as it comes from intersectional communities, and promises endless benefits — including the very redefinition of reality — to “marginalized” groups. Which is how Tim Walz ends up stumping for tampons in the boys’ bathroom. And how the Biden-Harris White House has repeatedly attempted to enshrine racism into law. Economic Redistributionist: Harris’ economic policies are rooted in this worldview, as are the Democratic Party’s as a whole. Thus, as they see it, businesses that are successful are definitionally exploiters; to have their wealth expropriated and spent as Harris and her friends see fit on groups they seek to cultivate then becomes permissible. Regulations are simply ways to establish equality of outcome. Innovators are to be punished as oppressors. “The rich” are seen as a separate class from everyone else, despite the fact that income mobility remains the hallmark of the American economy. The answer to everything: control. Top-down control. Higher taxes, more spending, more regulation. Giveaways, takings, and borrowing: These are the programs of Kamala Harris. That’s why Joe Biden brought about 20% inflation and why inflation outpaced wages. It’s also why even before Biden launched his massive spending initiatives, his White House forecast stagnated growth a decade into the future. That’s not a bug. That’s a feature: equality in stagnation. Foreign Policy Coward: Extended to the realm of foreign policy, the woke ideology means weakness and surrender in the face of foreign predations. It treats muscular and self-confident American defense as a weakness and cowardice as virtue. Harris says she was the last person in the room on Afghanistan — and she probably was. Both she and Biden still brag about the worst foreign policy embarrassment of our lifetimes, in which billions in military equipment was left behind for the Taliban as erstwhile allies were hunted down or fell off wheel wells at Bagram Air Base where 13 American service members were blown up just trying to help innocent civilians escape, and which ended with 19 million women stuffed into burqas in basements and deprived of any hope of a normal or decent life. It was that weakness that led Putin to invade Ukraine — and Biden’s first move was to offer Volodymyr Zelenskyy a plane ride out. Then Biden and team pursued the dumbest foreign policy available: a commitment to unspecified “victory” while slow-walking the actual aid that might attain something resembling it. Meanwhile, the Chinese are on the move, building steadily in the South China Sea, threatening Taiwan, and moving forward with every possible aggressive action short of war. Move to the Middle East, and it’s the same story: Biden alienated the Saudis and Israelis in a misguided attempt to establish moral parity with Iran while simultaneously freeing up billions of dollars to Iran to spread terrorism. All this culminated in the current seven-front war launched on Israel by Iranian proxies, which began October 7. Hamas is still holding American hostages. Yet Biden and Harris have slow-walked aid to the Israelis too, while simultaneously undermining the government of Israel, openly threatening Israel with cut-offs in military shipments if they don’t take Biden-Harris advice on fighting Hamas, Hezbollah, or Iran. And, most of all, Biden and Harris have been total cowards in standing up to the massive tsunami of Jew-hatred that has emerged from their own support base. Instead, Kamala Harris has implied that Israel is committing a genocide and that those protesting American support for Israel have a solid case. Then, there’s the border. Because Kamala Harris believes that America is rooted in xenophobia and racism, she has presided over a wide-open border. There are only two reasons anyone in high office would do this: first, in order to change the voting demographic of the country; second, because they believe the United States somehow owes citizens of other countries residence in America thanks to the guilt of the United States. For Harris, undoubtedly both are true. Finally, I’m voting for Donald Trump because of the institutions. I know this one seems to boggle minds, thanks to Donald Trump’s legal and public relations maneuvering between November 2020 and January 6, 2021. I saw no evidence of Trump’s contentions at the time, and said so; I thought his statements about Mike Pence’s ability to single-handedly refuse to certify votes was morally and factually wrong. I thought January 6 was wrong too, and tragic (although, to be sure, some of those prosecuted have certainly been overprosecuted). But Donald Trump is not the threat to the institutions of the United States. They survived him, with flying colors. Those who say there was not a peaceful transfer of power in January 2021 are simply lying. There was. That’s why Joe Biden took office without a military operation. It’s why Donald Trump left office as specified. The Constitutional checks and balances held up. And if Trump were to win, those particular checks and balances would never be implicated — specifically because Trump would have won, and thus there would be no further challenge to an election. Democrats have far graver plans for our institutions. They say it openly. And what’s worse, they also plan to uphold the power of institutions that have totally lost their legitimacy. Let’s begin with the institutions that must be preserved. Supreme Court: The Supreme Court of the United States remains a bulwark institution in our Constitutional structure, of course. The power of judicial review is embedded in all of our legal structures. It was Democrats who killed the judicial filibuster, then whined when Mitch McConnell did the same in order to confirm Trump’s Supreme Court nominees. It is not the Republicans who threaten the Supreme Court. It is Harris, who has herself pledged to try to pack the courts or institute term limits. The Supreme Court is no longer the plaything of the Left, and so the Left will seek to destroy it. Congress: Then, there’s the Senate. Harris has already said she would kill the filibuster, thus allowing controversial legislation to pass with a bare majority. Presumably, this would include the creation of two new states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, in an attempt to add four new Democratic senators. It would also include ramming through the so-called Equality Act, a grave violation of religious liberty; the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, federalizing election procedures and loosening protections against fraud and ballot harvesting; and other radical pieces of legislation. Meanwhile, it was Democrats who started the process of barring Republican nominees from committee assignments in the House; look for them to continue that practice and exacerbate it. Department of Justice: For all the talk about President Trump attempting to weaponize the DOJ against his enemies, he never truly did. Hillary wasn’t locked up; Joe Biden wasn’t investigated. But Joe Biden has activated the DOJ against Trump. Democrats would certainly use the DOJ to target any political opponent they could, as they have Trump. Of course, that would only be the tip of the iceberg. Barack Obama’s IRS targeted his enemies too. The executive branch is large and powerful — and it is Democrats who have used it against their opponents. Federalism: Harris would also be an ardent opponent of federalism, which divides power between the federal government and the states. Many have worried about the implications of the overruling of Roe v. Wade. But all that did is send the issue of abortion back to the states, where it originally was. Democrats pledge to give the federal government control over abortion and to do the same to nearly every issue. Democrats see federalism as the enemy and want a homogenous rule over all of the country. There are few policies better prone to lead to a breakdown of the union than that. Churches and Families: Then, there are the institutions that matter most: churches and families, what Edmund Burke called the little platoons of society. These are the institutions that build social fabric — the places we make friends and share family, where we build lives together. Harris’ federal government crowds them out. Churches, in this view, so long as they do not become propagandists for the progressive worldview, are barriers to the rule of the elite and must be torn down. They must be targeted with tax law, broken in favor of abortion-on-demand. Families, too, are a danger, as they may, in fact, reinculcate traditional virtue. Thus, federal policy must favor the destruction of families in favor of the values of the National Education Association and its friends: Children must be protected from their parents so that they can emerge from the chrysalis of Left-wing values, full-fledged butterflies of wokeness. This is why Tim Walz’s Minnesota is a sanctuary state for so-called “transgender children”: Parents are the problem. Then, there’s the other side of the coin: the institutions that deserve to be wrecked, but which Kamala Harris would preserve. Universities: The universities, for example, are the biggest scam in American life. Liberal arts studies have become indoctrination centers for the Left; colleges now teach students to protest their own civilization rather than teaching them to be good citizens. And it is the Left that has encouraged this. It is no coincidence that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was recently caught in an email telling the president of Columbia University to ignore Jew-hatred on campus, since only Right-wingers were upset. The universities are the corrupt preserve of the radical Left, and they are the breeding ground for Democratic donors and leaders. They are the engine of wokeness, and they ought to be torn down as they currently stand. Harris wouldn’t just preserve them; she would strengthen them by giving them billions of dollars in student loan bailout money. Legacy Media: Next, of course, there is the legacy media. The legacy media are the tail end of the Democrat-Media Human Centipede; they ingest whatever Democrats tell them and then excrete the digested product onto the American people. That’s how the media spent two years telling us that Joe Biden was mentally competent, only to then flip when embarrassed and tell us he had to go, only to go right back to ignoring his mental decrepitude so as to preserve him in the presidency. Not a day goes by in which the legacy media doesn’t prove to be a stenographer for Democrats. The same simply isn’t true for Republicans: When Republicans are in power, the legacy media hold them to account, and treat them as the enemy. The legacy media must be wrecked by the free market — and that’s happening. But it won’t happen if Harris and her friends work to enshrine their monopolistic dominance by cracking down on the social media platforms that allow alternative media to thrive. And that’s precisely what they plan to do. I’ve made the case here for Donald Trump and against Kamala Harris. There are good reasons to vote for Trump other than disliking Harris, as I’ve made clear. But here’s the funny thing about this election: very few people think the opposite. Most Democrats believe that voting for Harris is worthwhile not because they can make an affirmative case for Harris; that case is essentially un-makeable. They can only make a case against Trump. And that should worry you. See, here’s the thing: that case is speculative. And back before Donald Trump was president, I might even have agreed with that case: As I’ve said, I didn’t vote for either candidate in 2016. But then he was president. And so I know what his presidency will be: a solid economy, an excellent foreign policy, and a fight against woke ideology that endangers our future. And I know what she will be, too. Because that’s not speculative either. Kamala Harris can’t name a single way she disagreed with Joe Biden. And Biden was a tool of the woke Left. He presided over economic stagnation, foreign policy collapse, and the continued fraying of our social compact. She would do the same. Which is why you should ignore all the alarmists. There is no mystery to this election. We know what Trump 2 would look like: Trump 1. And we know what Harris would look like: Biden 2. That’s the call. That’s the whole thing. So you don’t have to love Donald Trump. Hell, you don’t even have to like Donald Trump. But you do need someone to fix the problems that plague the country, not exacerbate them. And that man is Donald Trump. Which is why I voted for him, and I hope you will too. Continue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+ Already a member?

Former President Donald Trump plans to blitz through three battleground states on Monday, while Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to focus on Pennsylvania with Election Day just hours away. Trump is scheduled to hold rallies in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, while Harris will spend the day campaigning in the Keystone State. The latest polling shows that Trump has a narrow lead in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and Harris has a slight edge in Michigan. The final day of campaigning comes as tens of millions of Americans have already voted, and the candidates have spent hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump will begin Monday morning in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he will speak at the J.S. Dorton arena at 10:00 a.m. Trump, who won the state in both 2016 and 2020, also visited the Tar Heel State on Saturday and Sunday, where he held rallies in Gastonia, Greensboro, and Kinston. Next, Trump will head to Pennsylvania for events in Reading and Pittsburgh. On Sunday, he rallied in Lititz, where he urged his supporters to show up to the polls on Tuesday. “You need to get out and vote, it’s very simple,” Trump said. “For the past nine years, we’ve been fighting against the most sinister and corrupt forces anywhere on earth. With your vote in this election you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Trump’s last event on Monday will be in Grand Rapids, Michigan, scheduled to begin at 10:30 p.m. In 2016 and 2020, Trump also closed out his campaigns in Grand Rapids. Harris is holding events in Scranton, Allentown, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. The stops in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia will feature celebrities like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ricky Martin, The Roots, and Oprah Winfrey. “We need you to vote, Pennsylvania. We need you to vote,” Harris said last week during an event in Harrisburg. “No one can sit on the sidelines.” Harris spent the weekend campaigning in Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina. Harris’ running mate, Governor Tim Walz (D-MN), will spend Monday in the Midwest, visiting the Wisconsin cities of La Crosse, Stevens Point, and Milwaukee before heading to Detroit, Michigan. Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Senator JD Vance will visit four battleground states on Monday, holding events in La Crosse, Wisconsin; Flint, Michigan; Atlanta, Georgia; and Newtown, Pennsylvania.

Former President Donald Trump said Vice President Kamala Harris would not be able to handle the pressure of meeting with world leaders like China’s President Xi Jinping if elected president. Trump made the remarks on Saturday during a rally in Gastonia, North Carolina, as he makes a final campaign swing through pivotal states as Election Day approaches. “There are some people who thrive under pressure and there are some people who crack,” Trump said. “If Kamala can’t handle an interview with Joe Rogan, then she can’t handle the presidency. She certainly can’t handle Putin or President Xi of China. She will get overwhelmed, melt down, and millions of people will die, perhaps. This is not a charity event — this is an election for the biggest and toughest job anywhere in the world.” Trump’s interview with Rogan last week has already been viewed 43 million times on YouTube alone. Rogan and Harris could not agree to an interview after the vice president asked the popular podcast host to travel to her for the interview and restrict the time to just one hour. “For the record, the Harris campaign has not passed on doing the podcast. They offered a date for Tuesday, but I would have had to travel to her and they only wanted to do an hour,” Rogan wrote on X earlier this week. “I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin,” he added. “My sincere wish is to just have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being. I really hope we can make it happen.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Later in the North Carolina rally, Trump slammed Harris’ economic plans, saying that there would be major consequences for people’s livelihoods if she was elected. “Do you want to lose your life savings because we put a weak and foolish woman in the White House? Do you want to lose your job and maybe your house and pension because Kamala has the economic understanding of a child?” he said. Trump is expected to return to North Carolina for several more rallies before Election Day. He won the state in both 2016 and 2020 and has a 1.4% average lead in the state according to an average of 67 polls. Already have an account?

A 60-year-old male has been arrested for beating a Trump supporter inside a New York grocery store over the victim’s “Trump 2024” hat, police say. The suspect, Robert Yott, allegedly targeted the Trump supporter over his “Trump 2024” hat and repeatedly punched the victim in the head and face, leaving the Trump supporter with broken teeth and a bloodied mouth, the report said. “On [November 1], around 10:00 a.m., the Village of Bath Police Department was dispatched to a fight at the Tops Friendly Markets,” a press release from The Village of Bath Police Department said. Bath is a small town located in Steuben County. “It was determined that Robert Yott, age 60, of Bath, initiated a confrontation with a stranger inside Tops, after becoming aggressive over the fact that the stranger was wearing a Trump 2024 hat,” police said. “Mr. Yott punched the victim in the mouth and head several times, causing the victim’s teeth to be broken and mouth bloody,” the press release continued. “Mr. Yott was not known to the victim and this appears to be a random act of violence.” Following the assault, Yott was arrested and charged with one count of assault in the second degree and fourth degree criminal mischief. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “Mr. Yott was arrested and charged with one count of Assault in the Second Degree, a Class D Felony, and Criminal Mischief in the Fourth Degree, a Class A Misdemeanor,” the department said. “Mr. Yott was processed and transported to Steuben County Jail where he is currently awaiting CAP arraignment.” Numerous supporters of former President Donald Trump have been targeted and attacked for their political views. In June, for example, an 82-year-old man in Massachusetts was allegedly assaulted by a 27-year-old male for holding a Trump sign, police said. In April, a 64-year-old man from New Jersey was allegedly assaulted with a sledgehammer and was hospitalized for significant injuries to the head. The suspect, 36-year-old Michael Gonzales, was charged with attempted murder over the assault. The victim, Rocky Granata, was known for driving around New Jersey in a vehicle covered with pro-Trump and MAGA messages, reports indicate.

Her judgment on humans is stellar. Jimmy Kimmel, by the way, is now so excited for Kamala Harris that he is actually violating the law. Here he was the other night doing just that: When I made an election joke, the Deep State used it as a pretext to conduct a fishing expedition against me, subpoenaing all financial records, leases, employment information and pay stubs, and email accounts. Will Jimmy Kimmel enjoy the same? https://t.co/uAMI9saL2i — Douglass Mackey (@DougMackeyCase) October 31, 2024 So, yes, that’s a joke. The problem is, the Department of Justice actually prosecuted a man named Douglass Mackey back in October of 2023 for this exact same joke. Mackey had about 58,000 Twitter followers when he tweeted out and texted some information suggesting that black voters should show up late for the election. They prosecuted him and he went to jail. Jimmy Kimmel, however, can apparently do it with no problem at all. But the desperation is setting in for the Democratic Party. They’re looking for a closing argument. Their latest attempt comes courtesy of President Trump himself. President Trump was out on the campaign trail with Tucker Carlson last night in Glendale, Arizona, and he started talking about Liz Cheney. Here is what he had to say: 🚨To every FAKE NEWS reporter taking President Trump’s words out of context: President Trump was CLEARLY explaining that warmongers like Liz Cheney are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight them, rather than go into combat themselves.pic.twitter.com/UlHvKszEIY — Karoline Leavitt (@kleavittnh) November 1, 2024 I actually don’t like the Chicken Hawk argument. It was crap when it was trotted out against George W. Bush and all of his supporters back in the 2000s and I think it’s crap now. I don’t think congressmen are sitting there thinking, “Well, it’s not me, so I’m just going to send troops.” The reality is, there are wide differences of opinion about foreign policy among people who have served in the military and people who have not served in the military. So, I don’t like the Chicken Hawk argument because it’s specious, empty, and foolish. But that is not the rip on Trump. What they are ripping Trump for is the part where he said, “Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her…” They’re claiming he wants her assassinated. I’m sorry, but that’s just not true. It’s not real. Trump is not calling for the killing of Liz Cheney. He’s clearly making the exact same argument the entire Left made about the entire Right during the period 2002 to 2008 in which they said, “You guys are really sanguine about sending troops into harm’s way, but very few of you have served in the military and it would be totally different if you were on the front lines with barrels trained at you.” Liz Cheney then put out a statement saying: This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. Listen, it’s not my fault you can’t speak English or that you’re being radically dishonest by taking President Trump out of context. Then, this was the literal headline today over at Drudge: TRUMP CALLS FOR CHENEY’S EXECUTION WANTS MILITARY TRIBUNAL ARIZONA AG INVESTIGATES! HARRIS CONDEMNS HIS VIOLENT RHETORIC That’s not remotely true. And then there was this one from the Daily Express: Trump says Liz Cheney should be ‘shot in the face’ by nine guns in sickening fantasy. Donald Trump has caused controversy by suggesting Liz Cheney should have “guns trained on her face” in an alarming firing squad fantasy. Not a fact. That’s not remotely what he said. This is the stupidest game — and they’re now playing this game full-time. They’re finding things that Trump says that are actually unobjectionable on their face. You can disagree with the argument, but the actual language is being skewed and twisted in order to achieve something that Trump never said. * * * Continue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+ Already a member?

We're going to lose our ability to worship."" Heritage Action for America’s President Kevin Roberts called on Americans of faith to get out to the polls, warning that Kamala Harris is the most “anti-religion” candidate the United States has ever seen. “I don’t believe it is hyperbole to claim that Vice President Kamala Harris is the most anti-faith, anti-religion presidential candidate in our history,” Roberts said during a media roundtable on Friday. Roberts, who is Catholic, drew on Culture Research Center polling that found only 51% of religious Americans are likely to vote in the 2024 election. According to that research, the other 49% of religious Americans who don’t plan to vote represents about 104 million eligible non-voters. Roberts argued that they need to get to the polls — or they may lose their ability to worship. “People of faith who are worried about the choice they are making really need to understand what’s at stake,” he said. “We’re going to lose our ability to worship. We’re going to lose our religious liberty if the Harris, Walz campaign prevails.” “There are people of faith who are sitting on the sidelines, because they have forgotten that we’re electing a president, not a pastor,” Roberts argued. “None of us are perfect. I’m not perfect. None of you, dare I say, are perfect. We believe in the doctrine of original sin. Donald Trump therefore is not perfect. Even my Catholic friend JD Vance is not perfect.” The Heritage Foundation president discussed how some religious voters may have qualms with Trump’s abortion policies. Trump has said that he would not sign a national law protecting the unborn — a move that some Republicans view as a political necessity, but many pro-lifers have taken as a betrayal. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “While certainly the position of Heritage Action and the Heritage Foundation is more robust than where President Trump is, [religious voters] need to remember the former president’s track record on this,” Roberts said, referring to Trump’s legacy as the president to appoint the Supreme Court justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. Trump is also the first president to attend the national March for Life in person, appointed a slew of pro-life federal judges throughout his time as president, signed an executive order protecting babies born alive in botched abortions, and significantly slashed Planned Parenthood’s federal funding. “If President Trump and Senator Vance are elected next Tuesday, there is a far greater chance of being able to work with them and the people they appoint on issues that matter to us, including abortion and including religious liberty,” Roberts said. “I think in contrast, there’s a 0% chance we get that opportunity in a Harris, Walz administration. On abortion, on religious freedom, people of faith need to be mindful of that.” Harris has previously drawn fire for suggesting that a Catholic jurist, Brian Buescher, was unfit to serve as a judge due to his Catholic beliefs, specifically suggesting that holding Catholic teaching on abortion and gay marriage is disqualifying for a judge. She sponsored the FACT Act as California’s attorney general, a law requiring pro-life pregnancy centers to post advertisements about where women can get abortions (the Supreme Court struck this law down several years later). As California attorney general, she also targeted pro-life activist David Daleiden for his undercover investigations alleging that Planned Parenthood was illegally selling aborted baby body parts. Planned Parenthood has repeatedly given Harris a perfect score on their congressional scorecard, since she supports unlimited abortions and emphatically promotes abortion as “reproductive rights.” Most recently, she alarmed proponents of religious freedom by saying she would not allow religious exemptions for abortions as president. Religious liberty advocates have said Harris was expressing support for unconstitutionally forcing medical professionals to violate their religious beliefs by performing abortions. Jackson: “Religious exemptions [to abortion], for example? Is that something you would consider?” ⁰Harris: “I don’t think we should be making concessions when we are talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body.” pic.twitter.com/AVzyKEjBrG — Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) October 22, 2024 “She was emphatic last week or so when she made that comment about eliminating religious exemptions,” Roberts told The Daily Wire of Harris. “And obviously, that’s something that is a real problem even for people of no faith. Because if you eliminate our first freedom, which is to believe and worship as we shall, then all of the others are endangered. And that also is not hyperbole, because we have surrogates of the vice president’s campaign out there talking about beginning to abrogate the freedom of speech.” “This is what we’re up against,” he warned. “I think we’ve got to be ready to saddle up if, in fact, they prevail.” Already have an account?

With less than four days left, Trump campaign announced an avalanche of events on Friday heading into election day. He’ll rally in Warren, Michigan and Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Friday, in Gastonia, North Carolina, Salem, Virginia, and Greensboro, North Carolina on Saturday, and Lititz, Pennsylvania, Kinston, North Carolina, and Macon Georgia on Sunday. That’s all before Monday, the final day of his campaign, when he’s also completely packed: he’ll hold a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina at 10AM, Reading, Pennsylvania at 2pm, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at 6pm, and Grand Rapids, Michigan at 10:30pm. By the looks of it, he may be rallying until the early hours of the morning on Tuesday, November 5. Donald Trump rallies in Henderson, Nevada. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Meanwhile, Vice Presidential Nominee JD Vance is in Michigan, North Carolina, and Georgia on Friday, and Nevada and Arizona on Saturday. And a whole host of Trump surrogates are on the campaign trail until Tuesday: Robert F. Kennedy will be stumping for Trump in Wisconsin, Donald Trump Jr. will join Vance in Arizona, and the “Team Trump Women’s Tour” featuring top Republican surrogates will make a stop in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday night. Tulsi Gabbard, Danica Patrick, and Sage Steele will also be campaigning for Trump on Sunday in Wisconsin, and Kristi Noem will speak at a Trump event in Holland, Michigan on Sunday night. Kamala Harris has a slight lead on Trump in both Wisconsin in Michigan, while Trump has a slight advantage in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, according to FiveThirtyEight polling issued Friday. The Trump campaign will kick off a four-day bus tour in Pennsylvania on Friday, beginning in Limerick, Pennsylvania and ending in Bensalem, Pennsylvania on Monday, November 4. It will make stops in Downington, Gap, Glenmoore, Broomall, Lansdale, Hazle Township, Lehighton, Bartonsville, Philadelphia, and Telford. The bus tour will feature Trump campaign surrogates Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, Texas rep. Ronny Jackson, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz, former acting United States attorney general Matt Whitaker, former Department of Defense chief of staff Kash Patel, former White House deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, and others.

Photo courtesy of Team Trump. “Team Trump is traveling across Pennsylvania to meet voters where they are -from diners to sporting complexes to construction sites,” Liz Huston, a spokeswoman for Team Trump, told The Daily Wire. “Pennsylvanians are swamping the vote for President Trump because in her four years as Vice President, Kamala Harris has failed them.” “On November 5,” Huston predicted, “Pennsylvania voters will flock to the polls to elect President Trump to secure the border, strengthen the economy and restore law and order.” “Harris has made inroads among independents,” the Marist Pennsylvania poll release stated. “She now leads Trump by 15 points among these voters and receives greater support among them than President Joe Biden had in 2020, according to the 2020 Presidential Exit Poll.” “While Trump edges Harris among white voters, he falls short of the support he received among these voters in 2020,” the release noted. “Harris outpaces Trump among Black voters but fails to reach the support Biden received four years ago. The gender gap has narrowed to 12 points in Pennsylvania.” Meanwhile, the Trump campaign announced that it had filed a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint against the Washington Post on Friday, accusing the publication of making “illegal corporate in-kind contributions to Harris for President.” The FEC complaint cites a Semafor report on how the Washington Post pays to boost stories “critical of Trump as subscribers flee,” a story that mentions how the Washington Post “aggressively ramped up its paid advertising campaign, boosting dozens of articles related to the election,” starting Monday, Oct. 28. The Post was boosting generally positive stories about Kamala Harris, the report says. “The facts support a reasonable inference that The Washington Post made, and Harris for President accepted, an illegal corporate contribution in the form of coordinated communications,” the complaint states. “Therefore, the Commission should find reason to believe a violation has occurred, conduct an immediate investigation, and assess an appropriate sanction for this corporate interference in our elections.” Already have an account?

"16","https://www.dailywire.com/news/exclusive-seven-undecided-pennsylvania-voters-say-whats-driving-their-decision","EXCLUSIVE: Seven Undecided Pennsylvania Voters Say What’s Driving Their Decision","A focus group in two bellwether counties reveals what voters like and dislike about each candidate Polling has consistently shown former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris locked in a dead heat in Pennsylvania — and the results of a recently-convened focus group shared exclusively with The Daily Wire suggest the Keystone State is still very much up for grabs. The political analytics firm Cygnal gathered seven undecided Pennsylvania voters from Erie and Northampton Counties, which have gone for the winner of every presidential election since 2008. While voters largely agreed with Trump’s policy proposals, they were put off by his personality. However, the participants also dinged Harris for “flip-flopping,” and even those who are leaning towards the Democrat said they were put off by her aggressive focus on abortion. With polls showing Trump and Harris essentially tied going into election week, the winner of this key swing state may come down to which candidate can make a direct, relatable pitch to Pennsylvanians. “They’re both kind of touring with celebrities and making it all about them,” said Tiffany, a Republican between the ages of 30 and 44 who voted for Trump in 2020, but now thinks she’s more likely to vote for Harris. “That’s not resonating, that’s not fixing anything, that’s not discussing the issues. That’s just making it about yourself.” The candidates seem to understand what’s at stake: both Trump and Harris are scheduled to spend the last day before the election in Pittsburgh. Like voters across the country, the focus group participants were largely focused on the economy. Mike, an independent between the ages of 45 and 54 who voted for a third-party candidate in 2020, spoke for much of the group when he talked about the impact of inflation. “Today, I stopped at the grocery store. I needed two packs of batteries, some hotdog buns, and something else, and it was like $40 bucks,” Mike said. “We can’t sustain this level, especially when I haven’t seen a pay increase in four years.” Inflation was the dominant theme of the conversation: participants mentioned rising costs more than 40 times in the two-hour session. “What matters to me is when I go to the grocery store, I can’t afford to buy groceries for my family,” said Rachel, a Democrat between the ages of 30 and 44 who voted for Biden in 2020. “I have to pull from my savings. You step into a grocery store now and your bill’s already at $70 no matter what you pick up. That’s what matters to me.” For all the concern about inflation, however, none of the voters thought much of Harris’s pledge to impose price controls on groceries and other goods. Even those currently leaning toward Harris said they were very concerned about excessive government spending and the growing national debt. These voters say they would like to see less American wealth going overseas, an issue Trump has been hammering. “We need to find a way to get rid of our debt and pay it down, such as calling in all the loans we’ve given to foreign nations recently,” Tiffany said. One thing that isn’t likely to solidify Tiffany’s vote for Harris: abortion. Though abortion is a top issue for pro-choice women like Tiffany, she said that she finds some of Harris’ abortion ads offensive. “I don’t like it being used as a scare tactic,” she said. “Some of these commercials are like, as a woman, I should want to vote for a pro-choice candidate because I could get raped and need an abortion. I find that a little inappropriate for campaigning.” Jamie, a Republican between the ages of 45 and 54 who voted for Trump in 2020 but is currently undecided, said she was also bothered by the Democrat’s focus on abortion. “We have one candidate who believes in restrictions, and we have one candidate that thinks abortion should be given to a woman up until the point of the baby being actually born,” Jamie said. “It is a big reason why I don’t like Kamala Harris.” If one thing was alienating voters from Trump, it was his personality. Asked to describe what animal comes to mind when they think of the former president, most offered unflattering comparisons. Rachel said “peacock,” because “everything he does is based on how it makes him look.” “He has to look good,” she said. “So whether he perpetuates lies, whether he has to make things up, as long as it makes him look good, then that’s what’s going to be said.” Another said Trump brings to mind an ape because he’s strong but ham-fisted, while another described him as a bull in a china shop. A fourth said Trump was like “a pigeon because a lot of times he just s***s on everything.” Several participants worry that Trump’s style could hurt the United States on the world stage. When asked what advice they would give Trump to win their vote, several offered some variation of “show more humility.” But voters aren’t necessarily enamored with Harris, either. Multiple participants said the vice president reminds them of a “chameleon,” perhaps the worst label a political candidate can get. “Stop being so flip-floppy, so that people actually know where you stand on issues, and you can trust that you’re going to do what you say you’re going to do,” said Rachel, one of the voters leaning to Harris.

The Trump campaign is demanding action after the Colorado Secretary of State’s office said it had accidentally posted county voting system passwords publicly on its website for months. Lawyers for former President Donald Trump told Secretary of State Jena Griswold on Wednesday to order county clerks to temporarily stop processing mail-in ballots until county election systems can be reconfigured after the password leak was discovered. The voting system passwords from nearly every Colorado county, for equipment like vote tabulating machines, were posted to the Secretary of State’s office website in June and could be viewed by clicking “unhide,” according to The Denver Post. Griswold, who is facing calls to resign from Republicans over the security breach, has said that the password leak did not compromise election security because the state’s voting system had multiple safeguards in place. Still, Trump’s campaign is pushing for further transparency. “We are particularly concerned because your office knew of this security breach at least as early as October 24, yet concealed the problem by failing to notify anyone,” Trump lawyer Scott Gessler wrote on Wednesday. Gessler asked Griswold to order impacted counties to take steps to reprogram the election machines and said that it was “essential that you act immediately to protect the integrity of Colorado’s general election.” “We recognize these steps may be an inconvenience for your office and for the affected counties. But this inconvenience is necessary because it is the only way to guarantee that the elections equipment in those counties whose current BIOS [basic input/output system] passwords were disclosed by your office are secure and that the chain-of-custody for that equipment required by Colorado law and regulations is unbroken,” he wrote. In a Thursday response to Trump and the Colorado Republican Party, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Beall wrote that officials became aware of the breach last week. “It was quickly determined that the spreadsheet presented no immediate threat to the security of Colorado’s voting systems or the 2024 General Election,” Beall wrote. “The Department determined that because Colorado’s voting systems are protected by layers of security and redundancies, no single error can compromise the integrity of the system.” Beall said state cybersecurity experts would go to impacted counties to update voting systems’ passwords. CBS reported that Griswold’s office did not immediately inform county election officials after discovering the security lapse. “Unfortunately, clerks found out about it from an email that came from the state GOP, which was incredibly disappointing,” Colorado County Clerks’ Association Matt Crane told CBS Colorado. “If a mistake happens in a county, counties have to report that out to the state immediately. And so with something like this, when it is such so severe in nature, potentially severe, we think that the first call should have been to the county, so that we could have taken a look at our systems and at our security processes and make sure that everything was okay.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Griswold’s handling of the incident has drawn criticism from Republicans in Colorado, including former Deputy Secretary of State Suzanne Taheri. Taheri said that Griswold was trying to downplay the mass posting of the passwords. “She’s trying to say that in order to get in, you need both passwords,” Taheri told CBS. “Well, not really. The first password, as long as you’re physically there, you could then plug a USB into the computer, bypass the system password and get in and start doing whatever you wanted with the software.” Griswold has so far resisted calls to resign, saying there were no serious consequences from the breach. “No, I’m not going to resign,” Griswold told Denver7. “A civil servant in the department made a serious mistake that we have actively taken action to remedy. Humans make mistakes. And that’s why I’ve been so focused on adding more layers of security to our elections.” Already have an account?

The Trump campaign called out “fake news” reporters on Friday morning after multiple media outlets claimed that former President Donald Trump called for Liz Cheney, a former Republican congresswoman and current Kamala Harris supporter, to be “fired upon.” The media outrage was sparked by comments made by Trump while he was speaking to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson at an event in Glendale, Arizona, on Thursday night. Trump slammed Cheney as a “radical war hawk” who got to make decisions about war while “sitting in Washington in a nice building,” arguing that “she always wanted to go to war.” “Let’s put her with a rifle, standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,” Trump said. Cheney responded to the comments, comparing Trump to a dictator and arguing that he made a death threat. “This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala,” Cheney posted on X.

Iran more than doubled its GDP in a couple of years by about $200 billion.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Pointing out Iran likely used the funds to support terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, all of which are at war with Israel, he continued by recalling how close the Trump administration had been to normalizing relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, saying, “I think we needed about six months more in our administration to get the Saudis on our side.” Friedman said Indonesia and “some of the secondary Gulf nations” had also been ready to normalize relations with the Jewish state. “What people need to understand about the Abraham Accords is it wasn’t about showing these countries that we could move away from Israel,” he stated. “It was about showing these countries how closely we were aligned with Israel. That’s what made Israel the most attractive partner to the Gulf, that they were rock-solid aligned with the United States.” “What I thought then, and I think what’s been proven to be the case, is that the US-Israel alliance, at its strongest, is the fulcrum upon which you can then expand peace throughout the Middle East,” he said. “As it weakens, those opportunities not only become less, but the potential for malign activity and mischief becomes greater.” Speaking of the 2024 election, he said some Jews who support Kamala Harris “really just want to self-rationalize the idea that Kamala Harris will be better for Israel or better at fighting antisemitism than Trump. I don’t think there’s any intellectually honest way to get there.” Friedman spoke of Trump’s 2019 executive order that stated, “My Administration is committed to combating the rise of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incidents in the United States and around the world. Anti-Semitic incidents have increased since 2013, and students, in particular, continue to face anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on university and college campuses. … It shall be the policy of the executive branch to enforce Title VI against prohibited forms of discrimination rooted in anti-Semitism as vigorously as against all other forms of discrimination prohibited by Title VI.” Friedman called the order an “enormously important” tool that President Joe Biden has not enforced. “You can’t get tenure at a major American university if you’re pro-Israel,” Friedman asserted. “We’ve seen that over and over again. And this is the breeding ground for the leaders of America for the next 20, 30, 40 years.” Saying he was “really nervous” about a world where Harris won the election, he continued, “Who’s going to deal with making sure Israel has the weapons it needs to defend itself? The only thing Kamala Harris has ever said that’s in favor of Israel is that they have the right to defend themselves. I’d like her to point to any country in the world that, after it’s been attacked, doesn’t have the right to defend itself. It’s a meaningless platitude. Where she goes with that, I don’t know. I don’t think she really believes in the cause, in the ultimate justice of a Jewish state.” Already have an account? Your information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Former President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he intends to create a new Cabinet position geared toward cutting the cost of living if elected to a second term in the White House. He made the announcement as part of a “new step” to get “emergency price relief to all Americans” while speaking at a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with less than a week to go before Election Day. “I will create a new Cabinet position for a senior member of my administration who will be tasked exclusively with doing everything in the federal government’s power to reduce the cost of living,” Trump said. Trump also said he would sign an executive order on “day one” that would direct every federal agency to “immediately remove every single burdensome regulation driving up the cost of goods.” Voters have rated the economy as their top issue for this year’s presidential election, with the rising cost of groceries and inflation establishing themselves as two leading causes of concern for U.S. consumers. Trump’s 2024 rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, said in August that she would “take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans” and vowed to fight price gouging in the food and grocery industries. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Elon Musk, the owner of X and other companies such as Tesla and SpaceX, has suggested he could help Trump in a second term ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent efficiently by the federal government. Trump told Fox News two weeks ago that Musk wanted to be his “secretary of cost-cutting,” though he suggested the role would not be a formal Cabinet position because of the tech entrepreneur’s business empire. “He wants to be in charge of cost-cutting,” Trump said. “We’ll have a new position, secretary of cost-cutting, okay? Elon wants to do that. He’s running a big business. He can’t just say, I think I’ll go into the Cabinet. Other people can, he can’t.” Earlier this week, Trump unveiled a plan during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida to seize assets from criminal gangs and drug cartels and divert those resources to a compensation fund for the victims of migrant crime.

YouTuber Jake Paul announced that he’s decided to endorse former President Donald Trump and explained that doing so is the only way to “save America.” In a nearly twenty-minute long video posted on Thursday on X, Paul laid out his message to the undecided voter why he was supporting Trump and not Vice President Kamala Harris. However, he did note that because he moved to Puerto Rico to pursue his dream of becoming a champion professional boxer, he has “rescinded his right to vote” in the 2024 election. “But that doesn’t mean I can’t present my 80 million-large audience with proper facts, numbers, and data to encourage them to vote in the proper direction to quite literally save America,” Paul said. He listed the “number of problems that America” is currently facing, which he said included “wars, health, guns, jobs, economy, inflation, border control, freedom of speech.” “I think we can all agree that things just don’t feel right; America doesn’t feel good,” Paul said. “It shows that we are more divided than ever, and I can’t just sit back and watch this blasphemy unfold in front of me any longer.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “What is the problem? Democrats have been in power for 12 of the last 16 years, so if we aren’t happy … then who is to blame?” he added, pointing out that while Harris has been in office the last 3 ½ years, she has zero accomplishments. Paul pointed to a chart showing that when it comes to the cost of rent, food, gas, etc, prices were lower under Trump and that inflation was the lowest it’s been in thirty years. He said he knows the legacy media likes to paint Trump as a “bad guy,” but said he’s more concerned about “how good of a president he is” rather than with “Trump’s character flaws or what he’s done in the past. Because that is his job and that is what’s going to affect the people of this nation.” Who I’m supporting for president and why you should too… pic.twitter.com/OBd5uWrXTV — Jake Paul (@jakepaul) October 31, 2024 Paul said all he hears is that Trump’s “a ‘felon’ convicted of felonies … every member founding the U.S. Constitution and this great country that has grown from the U.S. constitution was a convicted felon of Great Britain. The people rebelling against the system, wanting to create change, wanting to disrupt, and wanting to do right by the people that founded this country were all felons.” At one point, he also brought up the transgender athlete issue, and said as a future dad, he will be damned if he’s going to send his daughter to a school that would let any man enter his daughter’s bathroom or “compete against her in sports. It’s bulls***. That is taking away women’s rights.” He said if a person “really cared about women and their opportunities and their lives, I think it would be better to have a president that doesn’t want biological men competing in women’s sports,” which Trump has said he will stop when he’s in office. Paul also made it clear that when it comes to protecting women, it’s Trump and not Harris who will keep women and girls safe — by stopping the flow of illegal immigration, with some “662, 566” with “criminal histories, 13,000 convicted of homicide, and so on.” Already have an account?

Former President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against CBS News for $10 billion, accusing “60 Minutes” of “deceptively doctoring” its interview with Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this month. The lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Thursday, alleges that the “60 Minutes” edits “attempt to tip the scales in favor of the Democratic Party as the heated 2024 Presidential Election — which President Trump is leading — approaches its conclusion,” Fox News reported. After Harris’ interview on “60 Minutes,” the news show released a promotional video where Harris’ words appeared different from her statements in the interview that aired. The “60 Minutes” edit occurred when Harris responded to correspondent Bill Whitaker’s question on Israel. In the promotional clip, Harris stated, “The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.” In the edited version of the interview that aired, Harris replied to the same question by stating, “We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.” Trump’s lawsuit blasts “60 Minutes” for allegedly glossing over Harris’ “word salad.” “To paper over Kamala’s ‘word salad’ weakness, CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,” the lawsuit states. “Millions of Americans, including residents of Texas and this District, were confused and misled by the two doctored Interview versions,” Trump’s lawyers add. After Trump and Republicans slammed “60 Minutes” for its edits in the Harris interview, CBS News responded three weeks later, writing, “60 Minutes gave an excerpt of our interview to Face the Nation that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response. When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Trump called on “60 Minutes” to release the transcripts of the interview, writing on Truth Social on October 7, “In normal times, what happened on 60 Minutes, (deceptively ‘doctoring’ her answers), would be THE END OF ANYONE’S CAMPAIGN! Kamala is slow, incoherent, and in no way qualified to be President of the United States. RELEASE THE TAPES FOR THE GOOD OF AMERICA. We can do it the nice way, or the hard way!” Despite being pushed by GOP senators to release the full transcript of the Harris “60 Minutes” interview, CBS News never did. Trump then threatened to sue CBS in a letter sent by his lawyer on October 21. “Instead of doing the right, transparent thing, CBS’s counsel retreated from the October 20 Statement and provided a hasty, weakly worded response letter stating that CBS would decline to provide an unedited transcript of the Interview,” the lawsuit states. “President Trump, in reply, sent a second letter (a) reiterating his demand for public release of the full, unedited transcript of the Interview and (b) serving as his pre-suit notice…” Trump is demanding a trial jury and at least $10 billion in damages, according to Fox News.

'But I can ask all Americans to vote, and I ask them to defend our country.' Pro-lifers jailed by the Biden-Harris administration for their activism are anxiously awaiting the results of the 2024 election. One candidate has promised to pardon them — the other candidate is part of the administration that locked them up. The Daily Wire spoke to a number of these prisoners, who are in jail for violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, a law protecting abortion clinics under which pro-life activists can be charged for blocking or inhibiting a woman from getting an abortion. As prisoners, they cannot vote. But they strongly urge their fellow pro-life activists and Americans not to support Kamala Harris, who supports unlimited abortions and who targeted pro-life activist David Daleiden and pro-life pregnancy centers during her time as California attorney general. “Paulette is one of many peaceful pro-lifers who Joe Biden has rounded up, sometimes with SWAT teams, and thrown them in jail,” Donald Trump said in June as he spoke at the Faith and Freedom Coalition, referring to 75-year-old pro-life activist Paulette Harlow. “Many people are in jail over this. … We’re going to get that taken care of immediately — [on the] first day.” He added that he will “rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner who’s unjustly victimized by the Biden regime, including Paulette, so we can get them out of the gulags and back to their families where they belong.” All of the prisoners who spoke with The Daily Wire mentioned this promise. “For the past fourteen months I, along with eight other anti-abortion rescuers convicted of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) have been incarcerated in Federal correctional institutions, praying Donald Trump will be elected and make good on his promise to pardon us,” wrote Jonathan Darnel, imprisoned for trying to stop abortions from taking place at a Washington, D.C., abortion clinic. He spoke with The Daily Wire from the Federal Corrections Institution Thomson in Illinois, where he will be imprisoned until February 2026. As he spoke, the prison’s automated message interrupted him: “This call is from a federal prison.” After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, the Biden Justice Department was clear that it would use FACE to target pro-lifers as a response to the Supreme Court decision. Roe’s overturn increased “the urgency” of the Justice Department’s work, said Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, including the “enforcement of the FACE Act, to ensure continued lawful access to reproductive services.” Darnel, Lauren Handy, Herb Geraghty, Heather Idoni, Jean Marshall, Joan Bell, William Goodman, and John Hinshaw all believe that abortion is the murder of an unborn child. They sought to stop abortions from taking place by praying or singing in front of abortion clinic entrances — and the Biden-Harris Justice Department imprisoned them all. Most of these pro-life activists are frustrated with Trump over his stances on abortion, but they expressed much stronger fears about a potential Harris administration. And they are grateful for Trump’s promise to free them. “If Harris becomes president I would not be surprised if myself and my fellow Rescuers receive more indictments and lawsuits,” Handy told The Daily Wire. “She is an enemy to the pre-born and to activists alike.” Handy is imprisoned in FCI, Tallahassee, a low-se­cu­ri­ty fed­er­al women’s prison, where The Daily Wire unsuccessfully attempted to visit her last week. Outside the massive prison, birds chirped and a soft breeze swept the premises, occasionally carrying female chatter with it. Otherwise, the place was eerily silent. This is the federal prison where the Biden/Harris DOJ locked up pro-life activist Lauren Handy for trying to stop abortions/save unborn babies in D.C. She’s incarcerated in the same prison as Ghislaine Maxwell, infamous cohort of Jeffrey Epstein. pic.twitter.com/xHmjlCTpSV — Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) October 31, 2024 Razor wire surrounds the premises. Visitors must wear very specific, modest clothing and predetermined clothing colors, or they will be sent away. Handy told The Daily Wire that “every time someone comes to visit me in person, I get strip searched naked.” FCI Tallahassee houses some notorious female criminals — Ghislaine Maxwell, for example, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s female cohort, is imprisoned there. Colleen R. LaRose, known as “Jihad Jane,” a woman convicted of attempting to “wage violent jihad in South Asia and Europe,” also served time in FCI Tallahassee, as did Russian secret agent Maria Butina. Handy is housed with such notorious women for her part in “rescues” — pro-lifers’ attempts to stop abortions from taking place. She’s one of the duo who recovered the bodies of five preemie-sized aborted baby bodies from Washington Surgi-Clinic in Washington, D.C., where she believes abortionist Cesare Santangelo is performing illegal abortions. The District of Columbia refuses to investigate the matter. “I am doing good all things considered,” she wrote. “There is much to be done to advance a culture of life in prison so I find myself feeling productive and hopeful.” William Goodman is another pro-lifer imprisoned in FCI Danbury, 14 months into a 27-month sentence for attempting to stop abortions from taking place at Washington Surgi-Clinic in 2020, like Darnel and Handy. He says he was housed with Steven Bannon, who was released from prison on Tuesday, and several January 6 prisoners. “Even though I wish none of them had been arrested and imprisoned,” he wrote, “their companionship has been a blessing.” Goodman, in messages to The Daily Wire sent from the Connecticut prison, described the upcoming election in serious terms. “This is an existential battle between good and evil, between life and death, between truth and lies, between sincerity and deception, between the First Amendment and censorship, between representative democracy and the administrative state, between those who love our nation and elite globalists, between freedom and state control, between our nation as a republic or as a tyranny,” he wrote. “As our divided nation splits into two different worldviews, the heart and soul of America lies in the balance,” he continued. “Are we or are we not ‘one nation under God?’ I believe we are one nation UNDER GOD! I believe we need to pray and take action as patriots. And I know I am not alone. There are millions and millions of Americans who feel this way too.” Goodman argued that the Harris-Walz ticket is “disgusting,” given that they have “made the killing of innocent babies the first priority of their administration.” He reflected on how Harris has described the right to choose as the bedrock of democracy, writing: “Such violent policy is clearly very harmful to mothers, fathers, as well as our whole nation, and obviously — it’s completely deadly for the most innocent & defenseless of all God’s children.” “Sadly, as a federal felon I can not vote,” he wrote. “But I can ask all Americans to vote, and I ask them to defend our country and vote against the evil of the Harris-Walz agenda which opposes Almighty God in so many abominable ways.” Some of the prisoners described their deep moral qualms with the election, especially since neither candidate supports the full abortion platform that they desire. Specifically, Trump has said that he would not sign a national law protecting the unborn — a move that many Republicans view as a political necessity, but many pro-lifers took as a betrayal. “If Trump is elected, we’ll be pardoned,” said Darnel. “If Harris is elected, more activists may be arrested. So of course I hope Trump becomes president. But which outcome is more conducive to the end of abortion? That, I cannot tell you.” “I encourage people to expand their view of what it means to be involved politically,” Handy said. “I believe we can create pro-life power through direct action, mutual aid and trans-local organizing. Pro-lifers should vote in a way aligns with their values.” While the Biden-Harris DOJ has targeted pro-life activists, it has largely ignored the hundreds of pro-abortion attacks on Catholic Churches and pro-life pregnancy centers since the May 2022 leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion indicating Roe v. Wade would soon be overturned. The FACE Act also protects pregnancy centers and Catholic Churches, and critics have argued that the Justice Department has weaponized the law to leverage it against pro-life activists. “Nearly every single prosecution of alleged violence against abortion clinics has involved application of the FACE Act despite the lack of enforcement on attacks against churches and pregnancy resource centers,” Catholic Vote’s Brian Burch argued to the DOJ this summer. “What policies are in place at the DOJ which contribute to this imbalance, and what is being done to rectify it?” The pro-life activists who emailed The Daily Wire from prison believe they were targeted. “Most cannot believe that we are in prison for defending innocent babies!” wrote Goodman, describing his fellow prisoners. “They think it’s crazy the federal government has come after us with such hostility. Their honesty and sincerity is refreshing. Many of the fellas have expressed their sadness over their wives or girlfriends killing their babies by abortion. Their stories are heartbreaking to hear.” As Darnel spoke to The Daily Wire on the phone, he paused his story as loud shouting and footsteps sounded in the background. “Oh, I think I gotta go, everybody’s rushing off to lunch,” he said quickly. “I’m sorry it had to be so abrupt.” Already have an account?

"25","https://www.dailywire.com/news/swing-state-showcase-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-race-in-north-carolina","Swing-State Showcase: Everything You Need To Know About The Race In North Carolina","North Carolina is the only swing state that could likely see a result on Election Day The winner of the 2024 presidential election is likely to be decided by a handful of swing states, including North Carolina. The state’s 16 electoral votes could be vital to whichever candidate wins them, so here’s what you need to know about the state of the race. Polling Other than a brief moment after she launched her candidacy, Harris has lagged behind Trump in the Tar Heel state. The former president’s lead has widened over the past few weeks, and he currently has a 1.5% lead in North Carolina, according to Decision Desk. Prior to Harris becoming the nominee, Trump looked to run away with the state, enjoying a 5-6% lead over President Joe Biden, according to RealClearPolitics. How North Carolina Has Voted In The Past North Carolina has been a reliably red state for 10 out of the past 12 elections, only voting Democrat in 1976 (Jimmy Carter) and 2008 (Barack Obama). The odds are in Trump’s favor, as the state voted for him in 2016 and 2020. Trump won the state in 2016 with 173,315 more votes than Hillary Clinton, The New York Times reported, getting 49.8% of the vote to Clinton’s 46.2%. Trump increased his vote share percentage in 2020 to 50.1%, but Biden narrowed Clinton’s loss to just 74,481 votes, or 48.7% of the vote, POLITICO reported, making North Carolina Trump’s narrowest victory of the election. What The Candidates Are Saying The Harris campaign has continued its national strategy in North Carolina, focusing on abortion and falsely claiming that Trump would sign a national abortion ban, an idea he has repeatedly disavowed. Harris has also claimed that Trump would cut taxes for billionaires while she would cut taxes for the middle class, even though her administration hasn’t done so. Trump’s administration did cut taxes for nearly all Americans, despite media claims otherwise. If Harris is referring to her plan to end taxes on tips, that is a plan she lifted from Trump. Trump’s ads in the state have focused on Harris’s support for allowing illegal inmates in jail to receive taxpayer-funded sex changes. What Early Voting Shows North Carolina has seen an increase in early voting compared to 2016 and 2020. As of Thursday morning, more than 3.4 million people have voted in person, while another 190,000 have mailed in their ballots. At this point in 2020, 3.8 million people had voted early. Of the ballots cast so far, 33.97% have been cast by registered Republicans and 32.68% have been cast by registered Democrats, with nearly 33% from unaffiliated voters. When Can We Expect A Result? Unlike other swing states, we shouldn’t have to wait days to know how North Carolina votes, Fox News reported. Each county counts its absentee ballots through the end of Election Day and uploads them to a central system, meaning that counties can turn in their vote totals much earlier than states that count absentee ballots after Election Day. Jason Roberts, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina, told Fox that about 90% of ballots should be counted by midnight on Election Day, so the winner of the state should be determined then. The only votes that won’t be counted at that time are provisional ballots that are counted after the election, such as overseas voters. What Counties To Watch There are three counties to watch in North Carolina: Mecklenburg, the metro area around Charlotte; Wake, the metro area around Raleigh; and New Hanover, which contains the port city of Wilmington. Biden carried all three counties in 2020, increasing both Barack Obama’s 2012 and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 totals in Mecklenburg and Wake. In Mecklenburg, Obama won the county by more than 22% in 2012, while Biden won it by more than 35% in 2020, NewsNation reported. New Hanover, however, typically votes Republican. The county swung for Romney in 2012 and Trump in 2016, albeit by small margins. Biden won the county in 2020, even though Trump won the state. So, New Hanover will be a good bellwether for how the country may ultimately decide. The problem for Republicans in the state is that, during the pandemic, many people from Blue states moved to North Carolina, and it remains to be seen whether they brought their failed political policies with them. Voting Issues From 2020 To Now Because North Carolina counts absentee ballots ahead of time, counting the votes was done on Election Day, without a prolonged count like in some swing states. The only slight controversy observed in 2020 was the disparity between polling, which showed Biden winning the state by a slim margin, and the actual results. The North Carolina Supreme Court in 2023 upheld a law, previously struck down by a lower court, that requires voters to show ID when they go to the polls. A lawsuit from the Republican National Committee attempting to remove 225,000 potentially ineligible voters from North Carolina’s voter rolls has failed ahead of the 2024 election, however. The RNC and the state Republican Party alleged in an August 23 complaint that North Carolina’s State Board of Elections had illegally registered “ineligible” voters, including potential non-citizens. The lawsuit was fought up to the Supreme Court, which dismissed Republicans’ claims under a federal law, but sent a separate state constitutional claim back to the lower court. Other Races To Watch Even though the state routinely votes Republican in presidential elections, it has voted for Democrat governors in nine out of the last 12 elections. It appears 2024 will also go in the Democrat’s favor, with Josh Stein up 14 percentage points over Republican candidate Mark Robinson. It does not appear that Robinson’s poor performance will be a drag on Trump in the state. Robinson has been blasted for his past statements saying he would ban abortion without exception, with ads featuring his comments playing almost around the clock. Neither of North Carolina’s two senators is up for re-election this year, and all but one House race appears to be settled already. Don Davis (D-NC), serving his first term in office, is currently fighting for re-election against Republican challenger Laurie Buckhout. The district has a +1 Republican advantage and is largely rural outside of a couple of cities. Decision Desk still gives Davis a 76% chance to win the seat, thanks to the incumbent advantage. It remains to be seen what kind of help Harris or Trump could provide for their respective parties in this race. Key Ballot Measures There is only one ballot measure on the ticket in North Carolina for 2024: an amendment to the state constitution that would prohibit state and local governments from allowing noncitizens to vote. The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina opposes the ballot, saying it is already against the law for non-citizens to vote. Supporters, however, say the measure would ensure that state courts and lawmakers didn’t encourage non-citizens to vote in state and local elections. Already have an account?

"26","https://www.dailywire.com/news/swing-state-showcase-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-race-in-arizona","Swing-State Showcase: Everything You Need To Know About The Race In Arizona","Polling shows Trump leading Harris in the battleground state, with the Democrat Senate candidate in the lead down-ballot Arizona, with its 11 electoral votes, has flipped between the Republican and Democratic nominees in recent elections. This year, polling shows that either candidate could win on November 5th. Here’s everything you need to know about Arizona. Polling Current polling averages have former President Donald Trump with a slight, 2.2% lead over Vice President Kamala Harris, with the two candidates slated to receive 48.8% and 46.6% of the vote in the state, respectively. Trump has maintained a lead over Harris in Arizona since mid-September, when the two were tied in a dead heat. Harris held a lead over Trump in Arizona in August, hitting a high water mark of 1.4% on August 22nd. Recent polling from Gallup found that the economy and immigration are the top issues for Trump supporters, while Harris supporters name health care, Supreme Court appointments, and abortion as their top issues. What The Candidates Are Saying Both Trump and Harris are rallying in Arizona on Halloween, less than a week before the election, as they make their final pitches to voters in the state. Trump will be joining Tucker Carlson for a live interview in Glendale to benefit hurricane relief efforts, while Harris is hosting a “When We Vote We Win” rally in Phoenix. The two have visited the state numerous times throughout their campaigns, each highlighting their core policy positions. Harris spoke at a rally in Chandler, Arizona earlier this month where she focused on the economy, healthcare, and abortion access, topics that voters consistently say are among their top issues. “Ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,” the Democrat said at her rally, also discussing the cost of living. “We will lower the cost on everything from health care to groceries, taking on, for example, the issue of corporate price gouging. I’ve done it before, and I’m going to do it again.” Harris went on to allege that if elected, Trump would impose “a 20% tax on everyday goods and necessities,” seemingly referring to his tariff proposal. Trump most recently appeared at a Tempe rally last week, where he railed against mass illegal immigration and blamed Harris for the “invasion” across the southern border. “She has eradicated our sovereign border and she has unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens,” Trump said. “My message today is very simple. Kamala’s migrant invasion, given to us through gross incompetence, disqualifies her from even thinking about being president.” How Arizona Has Voted In The Past President Joe Biden won the state in 2020 by a razor-thin margin of just 11,000 votes. Trump carried Arizona in 2016 by about 90,000 votes. The state went to the Republican presidential nominees in 2012, 2008, 2004, and 2000. What Early Voting Shows Early voting has begun in the state, with Bloomberg reporting that “the data shows a decline in early Democratic voters from 2020,” and Republicans “outpacing” Democrats at the ballot box. While Republicans have cast more than 434,000 votes, Democrats are lagging behind at over 365,000 votes. Another 232,000-plus ballots have been cast by those with other or no party registration. When Can We Expect A Result? Americans may not know who won the key swing state until several days after the election. Maricopa County is the state’s most populous county, and includes the cities of Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Tempe. Maricopa County recently announced that counting ballots from election day might take anywhere from 10 to 13 days. The county contains nearly 60% of the state’s registered voters, underscoring its electoral importance. Republican Abe Hamadeh, the candidate for Arizona’s 8th congressional district, has criticized Maricopa County’s plan to administer the election, warning that it “fails to account the time voters need to complete the FOUR-PAGE ballot, setting the stage for long lines & chaos on Election Day.” 🚨🚨BREAKING🚨🚨 Today, I partnered with the Republican National Committee (@GOP) to call for an emergency meeting with Maricopa County to immediately review their flawed Election Plan. It fails to account the time voters need to complete the FOUR-PAGE ballot, setting the stage… pic.twitter.com/GWjXE9zA1I — Abe Hamadeh (@AbrahamHamadeh) October 24, 2024 The Washington Post is similarly warning that the Arizona ballot “could create election day problems” because of how long it is. One early voter said that it took her 35 minutes to fill out the ballot, which includes 13 statewide ballot measures. The multi-page ballots could also create logistical issues for election administrators, presenting a higher risk that machines become jammed and take longer to count. Voting Issues From 2020 To Now Arizona has been plagued by concerns of voting irregularities and potential fraud in recent years. The state, and Maricopa County in particular, was a major hub of Stop the Steal rallies after the 2020 election amid concerns of potential fraud. America First Legal, a conservative legal organization, is suing Maricopa and Yavapai Counties in what it calls “a landmark election integrity case.” The case alleges that Yavapai County’s “signature verification and curing procedures are unlawful, that it has been unlawfully canceling voter registration without their knowledge or consent, and that it maintains unstaffed drop boxes.” Now some are concerned that illegal alien voting in the border state could impact electoral outcomes. America First Legal is also suing all 15 counties in Arizona, accusing them of failing to remove illegal aliens from the state’s voter rolls. Undercover footage obtained by the Heritage Foundation in Arizona documents self-proclaimed non-citizens saying that they are registered to vote, with many explaining that they prefer Harris to Trump. Maricopa County is now also ramping up security at its voting centers, even preparing drone patrols, police sniper teams, and armed guards for election day as some election officials have received threats. Other Races To Watch Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake currently trails her Democratic opponent, Rep. Ruben Gallego, according to polling averages. Recent polling from the Trafalgar Group has Gallego up four points against Lake, with the two candidates receiving 50% and 46% of the vote respectively. Gallego has a wider lead according to the most recent polling average, however. The Democrat is estimated to have 49.8% of the vote compared to Lake’s 43.4%, giving Gallego a 6.4% lead. Democrats currently control the upper chamber of the legislature with a slim majority of 51 to 49. The two are running to replace outgoing Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat turned Independent who announced earlier this year that she would not be running for re-election. Arizona has nine congressional districts, six of which are held by Republicans. Every Arizona congressman is up for reelection, with Republican Juan Ciscomani of the sixth Congressional district set to face Democrat Kirsten Engel in a rematch of the 2020 election. Ciscomani won the district, which encompasses the southeastern portion of the state, by 1.5 points in the last election. Campaign finance data shows that it has been the most expensive congressional race in the state, with nearly $14 million being raised for it. Arizonans will also have the opportunity to vote on ballot measures, including Proposition 314, which would create “a new state crime that prohibits a person who is an alien from entering or attempting to enter this state directly from a foreign nation at any location that is not a lawful port of entry.” There’s also Proposition 312, which would allow property owners to apply for property tax refunds if laws prohibiting illegal camping, loitering, public defecation, panhandling, and other similar crimes are not enforced. Proposition 313, meanwhile, would mandate that any individual convicted of child sex trafficking be imprisoned for life. Already have an account?

Former President Donald Trump told a crowd of his supporters on Wednesday that the Biden-Harris administration has treated them “like garbage,” highlighting President Joe Biden’s description of Trump supporters as “garbage.” During a campaign call on Tuesday night, Biden slammed comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s joke at a Trump rally last weekend after the comedian called Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage.” In response, Biden said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is [Trump’s] supporters.” Trump again brought up Biden’s comments at a rally in the battleground state of North Carolina on Wednesday, saying, “We know it’s what they believe because look how they’ve treated you. They’ve treated you like garbage.” “You know what the truth is, they’ve treated our whole country like garbage, whether they meant to or not,” he added. “Because they’re grossly incompetent people, and they’ve destroyed our country.” PRESIDENT TRUMP: Biden’s “GARBAGE” comments “were the direct result of Kamala and Tim Walz’s decision to portray everyone who isn’t voting for them as evil or sub-human… And we know it’s what they believe because look how they’ve treated you.

"30","https://www.dailywire.com/news/swing-state-showcase-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-race-in-wisconsin","Swing-State Showcase: Everything You Need To Know About The Race In Wisconsin","Wisconsin was decided by less than 1% in both 2016 and 2020. Wisconsin was perhaps the most consequential swing state in 2016, and was decided in the past two presidential elections by razor-thin margins. This year doesn’t seem like it will be any different. Here’s everything you need to know about Wisconsin. Polling Throughout August, Harris led Trump by as much as an average of five points before Trump started taking ground back in September and retook the lead in October. Trump currently leads Harris 48.8% to 48.2%, according to a DecisionDeskHQ average of 67 polls from Wisconsin. DecisionDesk HQ now projects Trump has a 55% chance of winning Wisconsin, a major reversal after Harris was given a 59% chance at the end of August. Trump winning Wisconsin would buck recent trends in the state, which Democrats won every year from 1988 until 2016. Before that, Republicans won Wisconsin in every presidential election but two from 1952 to 1984. The top issues for Wisconsin voters are the economy, immigration, and abortion. The most recent polling available from Marquette University Law School shows that 40% of voters said the economy was the most important, 15% said immigration and border security, and 12% said abortion. Trump is trusted by 51% of voters on the issues of immigration and the economy while Harris was trusted by just 36% of voters on those issues. On the issue of abortion, Harris was trusted by 53% of voters compared to the 30% of voters who trust Trump on the issue. What The Candidates Are Saying Unlike Hillary Clinton’s notorious 2016 decision to skip campaigning in the Badger State, both Trump and Harris have campaigned heavily in the critical battleground. Trump has at least two major rallies planned in Wisconsin for the final week of the campaign. On Wednesday, Trump will take the stage alongside football legend Brett Favre for a rally in Green Bay. Then on Friday, Trump will head to the Democratic stronghold of Milwaukee — where he received the endorsement of the city’s police association — for another rally. On Monday, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, spoke in both Wausau and Racine. Harris has a rally scheduled at the University of Wisconsin in Madison on Wednesday, where she hopes to appeal to young voters through a joint appearance with Mumford & Sons. Earlier this month, Harris campaigned with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney in Brookfield. How Wisconsin Has Voted In The Past In 2016, former President Donald Trump became the first Republican to carry Wisconsin since Ronald Reagan, winning the state by just over 20,000 votes. Four years later, Wisconsin swung for President Joe Biden, again by just 20,000 votes. This year’s race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is again expected to be determined by a razor-thin margin as polls indicate a statistically tied race to claim the state’s 10 electoral votes. What Early Voting Shows Hundreds of thousands have already voted, with Wisconsin’s election commission reporting Friday that early voting had jumped almost 40% since the same time in 2020. As of Sunday, the commission reported that some 405,744 people had already voted early. Around 108,213 early voters were reported in the Democratic strongholds of Dane and Milwaukee County. In Wisconsin’s traditionally Republican “WOW” counties (Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington), around 86,244 people have voted early, according to election commission data. Republicans need to perform well in the WOW counties in order to offset Democrats’ advantage in urban areas. Republicans will also need high turnout from the state’s rural counties. When Can We Expect A Result? In both 2016 and 2020, the results of Wisconsin’s presidential election were not known on Election Day. In 2016, the results were announced the morning after the election, while in 2020 the state was called for Biden after the election. Milwaukee and other cities have followed policies that require all ballots to be counted in one central area, which has caused delays in getting ballots counted in previous years. The 2024 results could see a similar timeline as 2020, but will likely not take as long as officials say it will in states like Arizona. Voting Issues From 2020 To Now Election integrity was a major concern for Republicans in Wisconsin after widespread mail-in voting during the 2020 election. One of the most contentious issues has been that of the use of drop boxes for ballots. In July 2022, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the use of drop boxes in 2020 violated the state constitution. However, the court reversed its decision in July after the liberal wing of the court took the majority earlier this year. The decision was celebrated by Democrats and decried by Republicans, who argued that the use of drop boxes would compromise election integrity. Use of the drop boxes is reportedly down this year from 2024 with about just 78 in use compared to the 500 that were employed in 2020. Multiple cities and villages throughout the state have banned the use of drop boxes this time around after security concerns. “I think that a ballot drop box does create opportunity for those that want to circumvent the law,” Dodge County Sheriff Dale Schmidt said earlier this year. Wausau Mayor Doug Diny is under investigation by the Justice Department after he moved the city’s drop box into his office because of concerns that it was secured to the ground outside city hall. Mail-in voting has already come under scrutiny in Madison after 2,215 duplicate ballots were sent out to the heavily Democratic city. City officials said the incident was a “mistake” while Republicans demanded a more in-depth investigation. The DOJ has also taken action against the cities of Lawrence and Thornapple after they decided to only have paper ballots and cast them by hand. Federal officials accused the cities of discriminating against the disabled. Lawrence has agreed to use one electronic voting machine and a federal judge also placed an injunction this month against Thornapple. Wisconsin’s Election Commission has been sued by the Public Interest Legal Foundation for records on the state’s voter registration process while another suit accuses the Milwaukee Election Commission of having 143,000 invalid voters on its rolls. In September, the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty warned that there are 144,347 people in Wisconsin who do not have to show an ID to vote because they are classified as “indefinitely confined.” This status exploded during COVID when officials in Milwaukee and Madison said all voters could claim it, though the state Supreme Court later struck down this guidance. The Republican National Committee has already filed multiple lawsuits in the state as well, focusing on ensuring that cities hire an equal number of Republican poll workers and special voting deputies to administer elections at nursing homes. This time around there will be no private funding for elections, thanks to a Republican-backed measure that passed in April targeting “Zuckerbucks,” referring to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s widespread funding of state elections in 2020. More than $10 million in Zuckerbucks was spent in Wisconsin during the 2020 election, according to the Foundation for Government Accountability. The FGA estimated that more than 80% of the funding went to areas Biden won by an average of 37 points. Other Races To Watch Other key elections in Wisconsin include a contentious contest between Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Republican challenger Eric Hovde. Like Trump, Hovde has jumped in the polls in recent weeks, with polls showing the race within one or two points. November also marks the first election with new legislative maps ordered by the state’s liberal Supreme Court and signed by Democratic Governor Tony Evers. Democrats are looking to chip away at the Republican’s supermajority in the Senate and majority in the Assembly. Voters will also have the opportunity to pass an amendment to the state constitution that would ensure only American citizens are allowed to vote in national, state, and local elections.

"31","https://www.dailywire.com/news/swing-state-showcase-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-race-in-georgia","Swing-State Showcase: Everything You Need To Know About The Race In Georgia","Polls and betting markers favor Trump less than one week out from Election Day. Former President Donald Trump appears to have the edge in the perennial swing state of Georgia, where he was defeated four years ago. The Peach State was the site of much controversy after the 2020 election, including a longstanding feud between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Here’s everything you need to know about Georgia. Polling With less than one week to go before Election Day, Trump has more than a 2-point advantage over Vice President Kamala Harris, according to RealClearPolitics‘ average of polls. Betting markets signal an even more profound gap in Georgia. Polymarket showed Trump ahead by more than 30 points with millions of dollars in bets placed. A similar margin could be found on PredictIt. How Georgia Has Voted In The Past Trump prevailed by roughly 5 points in Georgia during the 2016 election, helping to solidify his overall victory against Democrat rival Hillary Clinton. But in 2020, President Joe Biden and his running mate, Harris, defeated Trump and Vice President Mike Pence by a much smaller margin in Georgia: 0.25 points. Just over 12,500 votes out of about 5 million made the difference. What The Candidates Are Saying Over the past couple of weeks, while campaigning in Georgia, Trump pledged to lower energy prices and secure the southern border. He appealed to Christian voters, saying Republicans would “never lose” if they turned out. He also knocked former First Lady Michelle Obama, saying she made a “big mistake” in being “nasty” to him while she campaigned for Harris in Atlanta. Harris rallied in Atlanta along with former President Barack Obama, rocker Bruce Springsteen, actor Samuel L. Jackson, and filmmakers Tyler Perry and Spike Lee. The VP talked about taking the opportunity to “turn the page on the fear and divisiveness” under Trump. Harris also has sought to woo congregants at black churches through a “Souls to the Polls” effort. Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), and Harris’ VP pick, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, have scheduled stops in Georgia during the final stretch of the campaign as both tickets vie for the 270 mark needed to win the Electoral College. Harris is set to return over the weekend. Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp, who says he did not back Trump in the 2024 primary but will support the GOP ticket in the general election, told Fox News in August: “there’s no path” for Trump or any Republican to win the Electoral College without Georgia. What Early Voting Shows More than 3 million early votes had been cast as of October 30, according to state data — nearly half the number of active voters in Georgia. The deadline for early voting is Friday. Also on October 30, Georgia’s Election Data Hub showed that 206,333 out of more than 342,000 absentee ballots had been accepted so far. Fulton County, a Democrat stronghold where most of Atlanta is located, has led the other counties in terms of early-voting turnout. When Can We Expect A Result? The 2024 presidential election in Georgia may not be called by the end of Election Day, particularly if the race is close. Raffensperger recently told CBS News his state will get overseas ballots no later than Friday, November 8. “Those will then be the final numbers,” Raffensperger said. “And we’ll just see if that makes the difference in the total vote totals. I understand we’re very competitive, and that’s why we’ve done everything since day one to make sure we have fast, accurate and secure elections for all my voters here in Georgia.” The deadline for county certification returns is November 12. What Counties To Watch Cobb and Gwinnett counties in the Atlanta suburbs could be key in 2024. They went for GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, but swung in the Democrats’ favor in 2016 and even more so in 2020. Rural counties such as Baker and Peach, which according to the Savannah Morning News have larger-than-average black populations, went for Trump in the past two elections after backing Barack Obama twice. And there are counties, including Baldwin and Jefferson, that voted for Biden in 2020 yet split the ticket in 2022, backing Kemp and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA). Voting Issues From 2020 To Now Although Democrats raised concerns about voter suppression over a 2021 election integrity law, with some calling it “Jim Crow 2.0,” early voting this year has been record-breaking. “Georgia voters know we’ve made it easy to cast a ballot. It’s really that simple,” Raffensperger said in a statement after early voting surpassed the 3 million mark. “Over the past four years we’ve worked tirelessly to prepare for this election by adding Early Voting days and investing in infrastructure, only to be rewarded with the lies of Jim Crow 2.0 and a missed All-Star Game. We’re [battle] tested and ready, despite the critics.” Georgia, like other states, grappled with election integrity matters in the 2020 contest. Multiple tallies affirmed Biden’s victory while a flurry of GOP lawsuits were dismissed. Still ongoing is Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ 2020 election racketeering case against Trump and his allies. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty, says he is being targeted by politically motivated lawfare. In late October, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected a GOP effort to quickly revive new rules for ballot counting and certification that proponents argued would be good for transparency and accountability. The rule would require paper ballots to be counted by hand, and a judge called it “too much, too late” for the state to undertake. A judge had earlier invalidated the election rules, calling them “illegal, unconstitutional and void.” Critics of the rules claimed they could be used to cast doubt on the results and disrupt the certification process. Georgia election laws say the results must be certified by the Monday after the election. In one recent turn of events related to the 2024 election, Georgia officials said they stopped a cyber attack on the state’s absentee voter website. Georgia officials indicated during a press conference on October 30 that they expect lawsuits from the losing side in the presidential election. Other Races To Watch Besides the presidential contest, Georgia residents are voting in their local U.S. House race, but not any for the U.S. Senate or governor this year. Among the other face-offs is one in which Willis is seeking re-election as Fulton County DA. WABE reported how there are three state measures on the ballot, too. They include one for a local homestead tax exemption, another on creating a tax court with statewide jurisdiction, and a third on a personal property tax exemption increase. The leading voting issue for Georgia residents is inflation, followed by “preserving democracy,” immigration, abortion, healthcare, crime, and the war in the Middle East, a recent Marist survey revealed. Trump got better marks when it came to the economy, immigration, and the war in the Middle East, while Harris was viewed as being stronger on abortion and democracy. Already have an account?

"32","https://www.dailywire.com/news/how-trump-learned-to-embrace-the-transgender-culture-wars","How Trump Learned To Embrace The Transgender Culture Wars","From transgender athletes to parental uprisings, here's how the former president came around on the 'the 2024 sleeper issue.' Even Donald Trump was surprised by the massive applause he got when he promised to cut federal funding for schools pushing radical gender ideology on kids. “Look at the hand you get for that,” Trump marveled during a March 14, 2023, speech in Davenport, Iowa. “Bigger than, ‘We’re going to be energy independent!’” Nobody would have known what he was talking about, Trump said, if he discussed gender ideology at a campaign rally during his first presidential run. He was right. Four years ago, few Americans could have imagined a presidential candidate promising to protect kids from transgender surgeries or having men in their daughters’ sports. Trump steered clear of the issue in 2020. But 2024 has been a different story. In the campaign’s final stretch, Trump has zeroed in on the Left’s embrace of transgenderism, pouring millions into television ads that highlight Kamala Harris’s promotion of far-left policies, such as taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for illegal immigrants and federal prisoners. “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” warns Trump’s most aired ad. It’s also his most effective ad, according to Democratic testing results reviewed by The New York Times. Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you. pic.twitter.com/Yk1KBgMH4f — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) September 20, 2024 Republicans across the country are following Trump’s lead, aggressively messaging that transgender procedures are irreversible and deeply harm children. Candidates up and down the ticket argue that men do not belong in women’s sports or spaces, and that parents should have the right to decide what their children are being taught in school about race, sexuality, and gender. The Daily Wire spoke with more than a dozen activists and operatives close to Trump world, who say that events of the last four years — the grassroots uprising of parents against ideology in schools, the Loudoun County, Virginia, sexual assault of a young girl by a trans-identifying student, and the emergence of fighters like Riley Gaines on the high-profile issue of trans-identifying athletes — convinced Trump that this is a culture war he needs to be at the front of. Radical gender ideology crashed like a tidal wave upon the United States in 2021, when parents discovered the leftist content, both racial and sexual, pushed upon their children in schools without their consent. In late June 2021, Republican congressman Jim Banks sent a memo urging his colleagues to “lean into the culture war” as a “winning” issue. He took note of the “organic movement from parents across the country in places like Loudoun County” who he said were “fed up with the lessons their kids are being taught.” “As House conservatives, we should be sending a signal to these concerned parents: We have your back,” Banks wrote. That was just a few months before the real watershed moment in October 2021, when authorities arrested a father named Scott Smith at a Loudoun County school board meeting. The Daily Wire’s Luke Rosiak exposed that the school system worked to conceal that a skirt-wearing boy sexually assaulted a young girl, Smith’s daughter, as it pushed a transgender bathroom policy. Rosiak’s explosive October 2021 report came as Republican Glenn Youngkin campaigned to win over Virginia voters, and that report sparked a massive response from Virginia parents. Youngkin listened to these parents and promised he would be their champion. And he won. His victory in Virginia is widely attributed to his embrace of the parental rights cause, particularly in contrast with his opponent, Democrat Terry McAuliffe, who infamously claimed: “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” (Photo by Chen Mengtong/China News Service via Getty Images) The coronavirus pandemic allowed parents a glimpse into their children’s classrooms, and many parents were shocked to discover the racial, sexual, ideological, and even pornographic content their children were exposed to every day. Like the parents in Virginia, they began to speak up, and to share stories, documents, and testimony with publications willing to shine a light on their stories. Education reporting exploded in conservative newsrooms: a once-mundane beat was now rife with stories about explicit sex education, pornographic books, and the promotion of radical gender ideas. “We could have put the entire newsroom on education and we’d still have been leaving stories and leads on the table,” Geoff Ingersoll, editor-in-chief of The Daily Caller, told The Daily Wire. “Once American parents started to realize the state of public education, once they realized what they were sending their kids into, it turned into an absolute frenzy,” Ingersoll said. “No story was too small, and no longer were school board meetings routine.” And the politics of the transgender issue changed when it became intertwined with schools. “A lot of people’s views on the trans issue began to change the moment you brought kids into it,” one senior Trump world adviser told The Daily Wire. “There’s a big difference between what a 25-year-old does versus what a 13-year-old can do.” “Republicans are pretty live and let live when it comes to how adults want to live their lives,” he added, “but correctly draw the line when it comes to experimental drugs or procedures on children, who can’t coherently make these decisions themselves yet, because their brains aren’t even developed.” The adviser even pointed to polling showing that support for gay marriage has been trending downward for the first time in a decade. The left did this to themselves, he said. “That movement has basically become a trans rights movement, and has become all about allowing experimental procedures on kids.” Activists who spoke with The Daily Wire identified another key moment for the culture war messaging trajectory: the rise of Riley Gaines, a female college swimmer forced to race against a male, and to hand over her trophy when she tied with him. In March 2022, Gaines raced against trans-identifying swimmer Lia (Will) Thomas in the women’s 200 freestyle at the NCAA Women’s Championships in Atlanta, Georgia. The Daily Wire tracked down Gaines during the NCAA and first reported her story, in which Gaines argued that she and her competitors had been put in an unfair situation, and called on the NCAA to show fairness to female swimmers. (Photo by Rich von Biberstein/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Gaines has grown increasingly bold in her defense of biological sex, traveling the country to speak to college students and urge them to stand against the invasion of women’s spaces — even in the face of violence and harassment. Partnering with the Independent Women’s Forum, she’s drawn together a circle of female athletes, including Thomas’ former teammate, Paula Scanlon, who testify at both the state and local level, organize protests, and more. In August 2024 Gaines endorsed Trump for president, specifically because of his promises to protect women’s sports and spaces. “Some say they’re voting for Kamala Harris because she’s a woman,” Gaines told the Trump rally in Glendale, Arizona. “I’m voting for Donald J. Trump because I am a woman.” “I am voting for Donald Trump because I am a woman!” @Riley_Gaines_ brings the crowd to a roaring applause. Tune into our LIVE coverage in AZ.

Trump Jr. has two daughters — ”stellar athletes,” he told The Daily Wire — and seeing men stealing women’s opportunities infuriated him. In November 2019, when Trump Jr. appeared on CBS This Morning to discuss his new book, he startled the hosts by criticizing “woke goalposts,” arguing that trans-identifying weight lifters are displacing women and that “the goalposts never stop moving.” Trump Jr. told The Daily Wire that he realized “biological men competing in women’s sports wasn’t about being inclusive, it was about being invasive.” The president’s son said he spoke up about the topic at the time, even though many others in his circles were not, because of how eagerly leftists were pushing the issue. “As a father of two daughters, who are also stellar athletes, I immediately realized that biological men competing in women’s sports wasn’t about being inclusive, it was about being invasive,” he said. “And years ago, even before this issue was front and center, I spoke out boldly on the trajectory the left was eager to take our country. Sadly, I was all too correct.” “It’s an injustice and it’s deeply personal to me, just as it’s deeply personal to American families all across this country,” he shared. “The left constantly wants to lecture the rest of us about what’s fair, when at the same time they are endorsing the least fair policy you could ever imagine.” “Yet again,” Trump Jr. said, “Democrats want to have a debate about something that’s been totally obvious since the beginning of time. But thankfully, common sense Americans know that boys play with boys and girls play with girls.” The GOP’s embrace of the transgender battle has vindicated prescient conservatives who warned that far-left LGBTQ activists were pushing an agenda that went much further than gay marriage. Many Republicans regarded these warnings as sensational, and were anxious to avoid any suggestion they were anti-gay. “After Obergefell, when the Supreme Court shut down all the traditional marriage laws across the country, politicians were in disarray,” explained Terry Schilling, the head of the American Principles Project. “They just equated any opposition to the LGBT movement as a loser and they didn’t want to touch it with a 10 foot pole.” There was some movement on the issue: newly-elected President Trump signed a directive barring trans-identifying individuals from entering the military in 2017, which took effect in April 2019. Other than that, conservative advocates struggled to get federal agencies to act on culture issues. “I think it was a lack of awareness at the severity of what was happening,” explained Doreen Denny, a longtime adviser for Concerned Women for America (CWA), a conservative Christian organization that has been sounding the alarm on gender issues for many years. “The trend was already there,” she said. “Nothing we were discussing was hypothetical. Every situation that we were presenting, whether it be the domestic violence shelters, in women’s prisons, in sports, or in private spaces, they were already happening.” During the Trump administration, Denny lobbied federal agencies to keep men out of women’s sports and spaces like women’s shelters. And though figures like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ultimately listened and fought to protect women, getting there was an uphill battle. “They weren’t accepting that reality and recognizing the role that they had to step in, make clarifications in federal law, and make sure that this wasn’t happening,” Denny said. Meanwhile, Democrats and activists were mobilizing to pass the radical Equality Act, which would force schools to admit males who identify as girls onto female sports teams and into female restrooms, and more. The Equality Act passed the House of Representatives in May 2019, backed by almost all Democrats, who argued that the bill merely expanded LGBTQ protections from discrimination and that it was both crazy and conspiratorial to raise concerns about men in women’s sports. This was false. As Doreen pointed out, men were already making headlines entering women’s spaces. Since 2017, male athletes have been breaking female records in Connecticut, and in May 2019, a male runner who identified as a female named Cece Telfer won the NCAA title in the women’s 400-meter hurdles.

(Photo by Rudy Gonzalez/NCAA Photos via Getty Images) Child gender transitions were also beginning to make headlines. In the fall of 2019, conservative media lit up a high-profile story of 7-year-old James Younger, whose mother wanted to transition him to a girl, despite his father’s passionate objections. The story drew the attention of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz, prompting Abbott to announce an investigation into Younger’s case. But still, neither the trans-identifying athletes nor the story of little James Younger truly permeated the messaging coming from Trump’s White House. “It was strange [Trump] didn’t weigh into that when it was such an easy layup,” a senior White House official, who learned about Younger’s case from conservative groups at the time, told POLITICO Magazine in 2020. “There is a growing grassroots energy on this that up until this point is untapped. I would venture to say Americans feel like it’s gone too far.” Heading into the 2020 election cycle, Schilling argued that Republicans should lean into messaging on trans issues to win. His organization, APP, was paying close attention to the Kentucky governor’s race at the time, where Trump ally Matt Bevin was up against Democrat Andy Beshear. APP analyzed how thousands of voters reacted to Beshear’s positions on transgenderism, and found that “the sports issue got the most powerful response from people, specifically conservative Democrats and independents,” as Schilling told POLITICO in 2020. Schilling’s organization ran aggressive ads that fall. “Should men be allowed to participate in sports events for women and girls?” the ads asked. “Andy Beshear thinks so. Should men be permitted to use women’s restrooms because they identify as transgender women? Andy Beshear thinks so.” Though Bevin lost the race, APP estimated that the ads gained him nearly 13,000 new votes and narrowed his margin of defeat from 31,000 to a little over 5,000. And while Schilling was disappointed that Bevin lost, he felt vindicated — he had proven to both donors and politicians that the messaging worked. It would take a bit more to get Republicans on board with the conversation. While Schilling and others argued that Republicans needed to message on transgenderism, the GOP still shied away from the topic. “People weren’t there yet,” said Penny Nance, one of the top conservative activists fighting against transgender ideology over the past decade. “They didn’t understand it yet…it was like a freight train coming. We could hear it rumble. We knew it was getting ready to hit.” By this point, the issue of men in women’s sports had caught Trump’s attention. On March 1, 2021, Trump brought up the topic at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida. (Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty Images) “Joe Biden and the Democrats are even pushing policies that would destroy women’s sports,” he told the crowd of conservative students, activists, and commentators. It was a new bit for the president, who jokingly imitated athletes struggling to raise their weights. “Lot of new records are being broken in women’s sports,” he said wryly. “Hate to say that, ladies, but a lot of new records that are being shattered…Young girls and women are incensed that they are now being forced to compete against those who are biological males. It’s not good for women, it’s not good for women’s sports, which worked so long and hard to get to where they are.” That same month, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a rising Republican star, vetoed her state’s bill banning men from women’s sports. It was a political disaster for her, even after she backtracked. Schilling recalls the conservative attitude at the time. “You can’t even sign a women’s sports bill into law? This is pathetic, and we’re not going to support you for president or even vice president.” And former Republican Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson was eviscerated by conservative commentators and press for vetoing a bill banning transgender surgeries and procedures for kids (the state legislature overrode that veto). For the first time, it appeared that Republicans were paying the price for being on the wrong side of transgender issues. Other Republicans picked up the slack. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis signed the state’s “Fairness in Women’s Sports Bill” and promised to ban transgender surgeries for minors during the summer of 2021. He followed up with the state’s “Parental Rights In Education” law in March 2022, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by outraged liberal media, banning classroom discussions of gender and sexuality. State lawmakers across the country introduced hundreds of bills to protect children. According to one “anti-transgender” bill tracker, “2024 is the fifth consecutive record-breaking year for total bills considered.” Many of these state-level pieces of legislation are the product of collaboration between conservative organizations like the Heritage Foundation and the Family Policy Alliance network throughout the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a far-left organization that endorses child sex changes, says it is currently tracking 530 bills on transgender issues across the nation. One source close to the Trump campaign admits the issue “snuck up on us” politically, but credits the activists who relentlessly fought for it to get the attention it deserved. “The conservative movement educated the world, educated the country, and educated Palm Beach,” said the source, referring to the MAGA circles in southern Florida. “Our campaign was completely focused on economy and immigration, and because of grassroots amplification, this one snuck up on us. Then when we tested it, it worked.” Pollster Brent Buchanan, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based polling firm Cygnal, suggested that Democrats might underestimate how the issue polls due to leftist stereotypes. “Overall, it’s really an issue of fairness, not necessarily of sexuality,” he explained to The Daily Wire, “and I think that’s what is missed as to why people who question its use in political campaigns view it as hateful. It’s actually incredibly effective when you think about it from the lens of fairness. It’s not, ‘Don’t let transgender people play sports.’ It’s, ‘Girls worked so hard to get here, and then you let a dude in, who’s built differently, and ruin their chances of winning.’” Buchanan’s firm has used a tool for message testing through which Cygnal can run statistical tests on what moved someone’s vote choice. And he maintains that pushing back on transgender ideology is a “very effective message at moving female voters.” “I’m looking at a competitive congressional district right here,” he shared in a phone interview. “The number one issue, by far, that moved women over 55 in this district, was transgender sports. Not even a close second. And then when you look at women under 55 in this district, it is the second most effective issue, with tax messages being ahead of it.” Detransitioner Chloe Cole speaks outside the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, September 20, 2022. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) The Wall Street Journal recently dubbed transgenderism, “The 2024 Sleeper Issue,” arguing that the topic is playing against Democrats “in races across the country,” and pointing to the 69% of Americans who told Gallup that “transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that conform with their birth gender.” “It could be a decisive issue for the election,” Nance, the CEO and President of Concerned Women for America, told The Daily Wire. “If Republicans are brave enough to stand up for young women, then they will be rewarded by women voters, Republican, Democrat, and Independent.” But in the end, the Trump campaign would never have spent a penny on the transgenderism issue if Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio and his polling didn’t validate that messaging, according to someone close to the campaign. “Tony is absolutely religious when it comes to spending only on the top two or three issues,” the source close to the Trump campaign reflected. “That bar is so high with Tony and this team. They’re not squandering money, on advertising they’re absolutely frugal.” In July 2023, Trump signed Concerned Women for America’s presidential pledge to uphold the dignity of women and motherhood. The pledge was very clear: “Only women can be pregnant and bear children. Only women can be mothers…My administration will focus on affirming sex-based distinctions that protect women in every area, such as shelters, prisons, housing, health care, defense, education, and sports.” CEO and President of CWA Penny Nance says a prayer for Donald Trump on September 15, 2023, in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) By September of that year, when he delivered a campaign speech in Dubuque, Iowa, Trump promised to not only to keep males out of female sports, but also to protect children from irreversible transgender procedures, and to block federal funds from hospitals that participate in the “chemical or physical mutilation of youth.” By this point, many young men and women who had attempted to transition to another gender began to speak up about their mental and physical distress. These individuals, now known as detransitioners, shared their stories in now-viral social media posts, drawing the attention of top Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson, who invited detransitioner Chloe Cole to testify before Congress. “I will sign a law,” Trump promised in Iowa that year, “in all 50 states [that] will prohibit sexual mutilation of these beautiful children.” Schilling says Trump is very aware of the intricacies of transgender issues. On a July visit to Mar-A-Lago, Schilling whipped out his polling “to show President Trump how important family issues are to voters.” “He’s more aware of what Dems are doing to our kids than most politicians I’ve met,” Schilling tweeted at the time. “I told him, ‘Mr. President, you’ve had our backs and we’ve got yours. Let’s win!’” I had the opportunity to show President Trump how important family issues are to voters. He’s more aware of what Dems are doing to our kids than most politicians I’ve met. I told him, “Mr. President, you’ve had our backs and we’ve got yours. Let’s win!” pic.twitter.com/LMXIW5aq0z — Terry Schilling 🇺🇸 (@Schilling1776) July 24, 2024 Schilling’s persistence, and the persistence of other conservative activists, has greatly contributed to Trump’s understanding of the transgender issue, a source close to the Trump campaign said. “Many people like Schilling brought their concerns to the campaign, one by one by one,” that individual shared. Now, with just days until the election, Trump, his campaign, and top Republicans are aggressively messaging that the Left has gone too far on transgenderism. Trump’s campaign platform promises to “cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.” And, of course, the platform promises to “keep men out of women’s sports.” That messaging, and the messaging of GOP candidates across the country, is resonating. In both Texas and Alaska, two major Democrats flip-flopped their stances on men in women’s sports just days ahead of the election. And the Trump campaign’s ads targeting Harris over trans surgeries for illegal immigrants got under her skin to such an extent that she tried to suggest, in an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier, that Trump himself supported such a policy — then argued that Trump is merely stoking fear with his advertisements. “He spent $20 million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters,” Harris argued, “because he actually has no plan in this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people.” The American people will decide for themselves in less than a week. Trump is betting that they’ll choose the party that stands with parents — and against transgender ideology. Already have an account? Your information could be the missing piece to an important story.

More Americans still believe the latter over the former, but the gap between the two beliefs has closed in recent years, according to the latest New York Times/Siena National poll on the question. This same poll has asked registered voters the question since at least July 2022, and since then, voters have shifted toward the belief that Trump had every right to contest the election and away from the belief that he threatened democracy. When the question was asked in early July 2022, 39% of respondents said they thought Trump was exercising his right, while 55% said he threatened democracy. This was more than a year after the events of January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters entered the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop then-Vice President Mike Pence from certifying the 2020 election results as questions about the validity of the ballots remained. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Now, however, the number of people who believe Trump was just exercising his rights has risen to 46%, while the number who believe he threatened democracy has dropped to 49%. The number of people who said they were unsure or refused to answer has also dropped nearly in half, from 7% in July 2022 to just 4% now. The latest poll with the question was conducted just after news broke that former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney had communicated with an anti-Trump January 6 hearing witness. Cheney, then representing Wyoming, communicated with the “star witness” of the hearing behind the witness’ attorney’s back, The Daily Wire reported. The initial communication was facilitated by then-Trump strategic communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin, but Cheney later communicated directly with the witness, Cassidy Hutchison. “Cheney interacted with the witness, former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, through ex-Trump strategic communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin — and later directly — in an effort to compel further testimony …” the New York Post reported. “Though she worked behind the scenes to obtain Hutchinson’s juiciest allegations in 2022, some of which were later found to be false, Cheney never mentioned the backchannel talks with Hutchinson or Griffin in her book ‘Oath and Honor’ about the riot,” the Post added. The conversations between Hutchinson and Griffin began two months before the hearing began. Hutchinson’s communications with Cheney started three days before the hearing. Already have an account?

Terrible to say a thing like that, but he really doesn’t know, he really, honestly, he doesn’t and I’m convinced that he likes me more than he likes Kamala.” BREAKING: Trump responds to Biden calling 74 million Americans “garbage” Trump says that Biden’s comment is worse than Hillary Clinton calling Trump supporters “deplorable” pic.twitter.com/hEPtEAYAof — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 30, 2024 The Trump campaign released a statement shortly after Biden’s remarks went viral on X, saying that the former president is backed by a wide range of supporters who have been labeled by the Harris campaign as “fascists, Nazis, and now, garbage.” “There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him,” the statement continued. “Kamala does not deserve four more years. President Trump will be a president for ALL Americans.” Biden made the remark during a campaign call on Tuesday night as Vice President Kamala Harris was giving her closing argument to American voters before the election. “Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community,” Biden said. “Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage,” Biden continued, referencing remarks that were made at Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City over the weekend by an insult comedian. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.

"35","https://www.dailywire.com/news/swing-state-showcase-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-race-in-pennsylvania","Swing-State Showcase: Everything You Need To Know About The Race In Pennsylvania","The Keystone State is important for both candidates, but considered a must-win for Kamala Harris. With its 19 electoral votes, whoever wins Pennsylvania will have a good chance at winning the presidential election. The Keystone State is critical for former President Donald Trump, but considered a must-win for Vice President Kamala Harris. Losing would significantly complicate her path to victory. Both candidates are spending the most time and money in Pennsylvania, holding dozens of events and pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into swaying voters. Here’s everything you need to know about Pennsylvania. Polling The polls show Trump with a tiny 0.4% sliver of a lead in Pennsylvania, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. Just before President Joe Biden suspended his campaign in July, Trump had a four point lead in Pennsylvania, a sizable lead for this state. As soon as Biden dropped out and Harris was informally installed as the Democratic nominee, she spiked in the polls, but she never led Trump by more than one point. Harris topped out in mid-September at 48.5% to Trump’s 47.5%, according to the RCP average. At this point in 2020, Biden was leading in Pennsylvania by 4.3 points. He won the state by a single percentage point. In 2016, Hillary Clinton, who narrowly lost the state, was leading by 5 points. If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she will have to win both Michigan and Wisconsin and one swing state in both the south and west to win the White House. How Pennsylvania Has Voted In The Past A true swing state, Pennsylvania has flipped between red and blue over the past few presidential elections. In 2020, Biden won Pennsylvania by approximately 81,000 votes. In 2016, Trump won the state by more than 44,000 votes. Former President Barack Obama won Pennsylvania by huge margins both times he ran for president — an estimated 620,000 votes in 2008 and 310,000 votes in 2012. Before Trump flipped Pennsylvania red in 2016, no Republican had won the state since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Ronald Reagan won Pennsylvania in both 1980 and 1984. What The Candidates Are Saying Trump has made a strong play for Pennsylvania’s blue-collar voters, emphasizing energy independence, specifically his support for fracking and coal mining, two major industries in the state. He has also promised to prioritize domestic manufacturing, arguing it will create jobs in Pennsylvania’s steelworking industry, which was deeply affected by the decline of American manufacturing in recent decades. Meanwhile, Harris has hammered the abortion issue, especially in the more blue areas like the Philadelphia suburbs. Her campaign is trying to mobilize minority voters in urban areas, although Democrats have complained internally that she may not be doing enough to mobilize that demographic. What Early Voting Shows Already, 1.2 million early ballots have been cast in Pennsylvania. For context, the state saw nearly 7 million total votes in 2020. Pennsylvania is the one swing state where Democrats are enjoying an early lead in early voting — about 60% of those who have voted early are registered Democrats, although that does not guarantee they voted for Harris. Pennsylvania does not have widespread early in-person voting, and Trump supporters tend to vote in person. This means Republicans could show up in large numbers on Election Day. When Can We Expect A Result? Pennsylvania’s presidential election results are likely to be delayed several days this election cycle, just as they were in 2020, due to the time it takes to count mail-in ballots. The delay is caused by Pennsylvania law, which does not allow mail-in ballots to be processed until 7 a.m. on Election Day. In 2020, Election Day was November 4, but Pennsylvania was not called for Biden by major news outlets until November 7. The call put Biden over 270 electoral votes, making him the president-elect. The process could end up being faster this time, since Pennsylvania is seeing fewer applications for mail-in or absentee ballots so far. As of last week, there were 1.9 million mail ballot applications compared with 2.7 million total mail ballots cast in 2020, according to state data. In the 2022 midterms, a flurry of recount demands delayed Pennsylvania certifying the results until December 22. This year though, the state must certify election results by December 11, about five weeks after Election Day, under a new federal deadline. Al Schmidt, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, will likely be in the spotlight as the election gets underway. The secretary oversees the state’s election process, including certifying the results. Local election boards submit the unofficial returns to the secretary’s office, which conducts a final review and certifies the official election results. Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who was widely expected to be Harris’ running mate, will then formally affirm the election results and issue a list of the electors chosen for the Electoral College. What Counties To Watch Many of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election in Pennsylvania targeted votes in Philadelphia County; Allegheny County, which includes the Pittsburgh area; and Montgomery County, the third most populous county in the state. These three areas will be heavily scrutinized during the 2024 election. As far as bellwethers, Erie County in the northwest corner of the state and Lackawanna County in the Scranton area will also be watched closely. Erie frequently flip-flops between red and blue, and Lackawanna is notable because President Joe Biden is from Scranton, and because it has a lot of blue-collar voters, a bloc that has increasingly turned towards Trump. Voting Issues From 2020 To Now Pennsylvania’s 2020 election was fiercely challenged by Republicans on many fronts. Republicans lost a challenge relating to Pennsylvania allowing mail-in ballots to be received up to three days after Election Day, even if they were not postmarked. The more than 10,000 ballots affected by this challenge would not have changed the election result. This year, however, mail-in ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. The Trump campaign sued after their poll watchers were kicked out by local officials from “satellite election offices” in Philadelphia and several other counties, where some early votes were cast. A local judge rejected the suit, ruling that these locations were not official polling places. Philadelphia is continuing to use satellite offices this election. Republicans also unsuccessfully sued over voters being allowed to correct mistakes on their ballot, as well as over Pennsylvania not requiring a voter’s signature on their ballot to resemble the signature on the voter’s registration form. Ballot drop boxes were hugely controversial in Pennsylvania and other swing states. Pennsylvania allowed drop boxes for mail-in ballots due to the pandemic. The Trump campaign sued, arguing that drop boxes increase the risk of voter fraud, but a federal judge threw out that lawsuit. Some areas of the state are still using drop boxes this election cycle. Several broader lawsuits also failed in 2020. A Republican lawsuit arguing the state’s expansion to no-excuse absentee ballots was unconstitutional was dismissed. That case could have seen 2.5 million mail-in ballots out of the state’s 6.9 million total ballots thrown out. The state continues to have no-excuse mail-in voting today. Texas challenged Pennsylvania and other swing states’ 2020 election results, but the Supreme Court threw out that case. Election certification was also a target of several challenges from the Trump campaign and other Republicans. Claims about dead people voting in Pennsylvania circulated as well, although there was not much hard evidence of this happening frequently. Pennsylvania completed an audit involving a random sample of more than 45,000 ballots that supported Biden’s victory. This year, ballot concerns have already popped up in Pennsylvania. In Lancaster County west of Philadelphia, a criminal investigation is underway after election workers flagged about 2,500 voter registration forms for potential fraud. Two other counties received similar forms, the county’s district attorney said. Last week, election officials in Bucks County, also near Philadelphia, said a viral video appearing to show mail-in ballots for Trump being destroyed did not show “authentic” ballot materials. The video was reported to the FBI nevertheless. Earlier this week, the Republican National Committee petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a Pennsylvania court’s ruling that election officials must count “provisional ballots” cast by voters whose mail-in ballots are rejected because they are sent in without a required “secrecy envelope.” Other Races To Watch Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey (D), who is seeking a fourth term, is running against Republican Dave McCormick, a successful businessman and Army veteran. McCormick has run a pro-fracking campaign and has also called for border security and reigning in spending. Casey, at one time a rare pro-life Democrat, has emphasized his support for abortion and has argued that corporate price gouging is causing inflation.

I’d like to shoot that guy,"" the Democrat allegedly said. A male Pennsylvania Democrat — who uses she/her pronouns — was arrested after he allegedly said he would like to shoot former President Donald Trump ahead of a rally at Pennsylvania State University. The 74-year-old resident, Paul J. Gavenonis, was reportedly overheard saying he’d like to shoot Trump while he was purchasing a parking pass at the university transportation office ahead of Trump’s rally on Saturday at the college, the Lexington Herald Leader reported. The staff member at the transportation office became alarmed by his comments and called the police. According to the university police, the registered Democrat described how he planned to climb to the top of one of the buildings and said, “You can’t take a gun in or the students will see it,” the outlet noted. He was also quoted allegedly saying, “I hate Donald Trump. I’d like to shoot that guy.” Another “white dude for Harris” Paul J Gavenonis arrested for allegedly threatening to kiII Trump.

Gavenonis was charged with misdemeanor counts of terroristic threats and disorderly conduct, the outlet noted. He was arraigned on Friday by District Judge Steven Lachman, who denied bail for Gavenonis. The Democrat is currently incarcerated at the Centre County Correctional Facility, the outlet noted. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, October 30. Gavenonis’ arrest follows two assassination attempts against Trump in the last few months of the 2024 campaign, as The Daily Wire reported. In September, the former president was targeted in an apparent assassination attempt, when a 58-year-old man hid out for 12 hours near Trump’s golf course in Florida, allegedly to take a shot at him. The assassination attempt came just two months after Trump was on stage at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 when a gunman opened fire, hitting him in the ear, killing one Trump supporter, and injuring two others at the rally. 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire, hitting Trump in the side of the head, killing rally-goer Corey Comperatore, and injuring two others, Jim Copenhaver and David Dutch. A Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks while other personnel rushed to protect Trump and escort him off the stage. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned after the shooting, one day after testifying before the House as she faced backlash over the security failure underlying the Trump rally shooting. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas then announced that Ronald Rowe, the Secret Service’s deputy director, would become acting director. Rowe said it was clear to him that “other protective enhancements could have strengthened our security” at the rally and listed some directives he made, as previously reported.

It’s a very big powerful party with smart people … but they’re vicious."" Former President Donald Trump blasted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday and what he called her “campaign of absolute hate.” During an event at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump accused Harris of “inexcusable” slander and lies as she and other Democrats ramp up their attacks on the former president, which have included calling him a “fascist.” Trump also argued that Harris is “unfit to be president,” adding that “her message has been a message of hate and division, and my message is about saving our economy, securing our border, and bringing together the greatest and broadest coalition in American history.” “She’s running on a campaign of immoralization, and really a campaign of destruction. But really, perhaps more than anything else, it’s a campaign of hate. A campaign of absolute hate,” Trump said. “I said yesterday that she’s a vessel. She is a vessel. It’s a very big powerful party with smart people … but they’re vicious, and they’re perhaps even trying to destroy our country.” “After two assassination attempts in just over three months, her lies and her slanders are very shameful and really inexcusable,” he added.

The vice president said the rally showed that Trump “is focused and actually fixated on his grievances, on himself, and on dividing our country.” “There’s a big difference between he and I. If he were elected, on day one, he’s going to be sitting in the Oval Office working on his enemies list. On day one, if I am elected president of the United States, which I fully intend to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list,” Harris added. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Harris also called a press conference at the vice president’s residence last week to slam Trump after an article in The Atlantic claimed that the Republican nominee praised Adolf Hitler’s generals and disparaged a slain U.S. Army private during conversations with his White House staff during his first term. Citing the article, Harris claimed that Trump wants “unchecked power” and “vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas.” The Atlantic article was refuted by the slain soldier’s family and multiple Trump administration officials.

Former President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday a plan to seize assets from criminal gangs and drug cartels and divert those resources to a compensation fund for the victims of migrant crime during a second term in the White House. “I’m announcing that for the first time under my administration, we will be seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels,” Trump said during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, one week from Election Day. 🚨 NEW POLICY ALERT 🚨 President Trump announces that his administration will seize the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels and use them to set up a compensation fund for the victims of migrant crime. pic.twitter.com/No6sxV5uxC — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) October 29, 2024 “And we’ll use those assets to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime,” he added. “And the government will help in the restoration. The government will help in the restitution, but something has to be done, and we’re gonna get it done.” While the economy appears to be the leading issue for voters across the nation in the 2024 election, immigration and violent crime are also top issues they consider to be important, surveys have shown in recent months. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ Trump’s 2024 rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, has faced blowback over the Biden administration’s struggles to curb illegal immigration because she was tasked with stemming the “root causes” of migration to the southern border in 2021.

Harris also gets flack over her support of the “defund the police” movement and promoting a bail fund to assist people who were arrested in Minnesota amid the George Floyd riots that took place during the summer of 2020. “The full consequences of Kamala’s four-year reign are almost too terrible to discuss or contemplate … Kamala is grossly incompetent — a total train wreck who has destroyed everything in her path,” Trump said during his press conference. Earlier in the year, Trump said during a Fox News interview that airstrikes against Mexican drug cartels were “absolutely” a possibility, adding, “Mexico is going to have to straighten it out really fast or the answer is, absolutely.

The results weren’t close. Trump received a whopping 66% of the vote, Harris a paltry 17%. 🇺🇸🇮🇱 New Poll by Channel 12: 66% of Israelis favor Trump to win17% favor Harris. The majority of Israelis support Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/LRRU48K0Z6 — Vivid.🇮🇱 (@VividProwess) October 28, 2024 Israelis are highly aware of and grateful for the friendship Trump has shown to the Jewish state; Trump’s unmatched support for Israel has been well-documented. In 1995, Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel and called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city. It called for setting aside funds to relocate the American Embassy to Jerusalem by 1999. The law allowed the president to invoke a six-month waiver of the application of the law and reissue the waiver every six months on “national security” grounds. The waiver was repeatedly renewed by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+ But Trump made the move happen in 2018. On February 23, 2018, Trump announced that the US Embassy in Israel would reopen in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. In addition, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, an area that was vital to Israel’s national security interests, as its enemies would fire down at Israelis in every previous war. “We’re gathered tonight to talk about the sacred bond between the United States and Israel, and it’s a bond that’s in serious trouble,” Trump said in September. “In less than three weeks, we will mark the one-year anniversary of the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. On October 7, Hamas terrorists slaughtered more than 1,200 Israelis, including men, women, children, and even little, beautiful babies. They tortured, wounded, kidnapped, and horribly maimed thousands more. Unthinkable.” “This evening, we repeat the vow that we have kept in our hearts since the terrible day in October: Never again,” he declared. “This should never have ever happened. … Weak leadership in the United States allowed this to happen, and it should never have happened.” “If we continue down our current path, with four more years of Kamala, Israel will be faced not just with an attack, but with total annihilation,” he asserted. “You don’t have a protector. You have a big protector in me; you don’t have a protector on the other side. And I’ve said long and loud, anybody, and especially over the last few years, anybody who’s Jewish and loves being Jewish and loves Israel is a fool if they vote for a Democrat.” Israel will face “unceasing, bloody war to obliterate the Jewish state and drive Jews out of the Holy Land.

"40","https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-rocks-madison-square-garden-kamala-panics","Trump Rocks Madison Square Garden, Kamala Panics","If you look at the behavior of the two campaigns, it is pretty clear whom both campaigns think is ahead. We are now one week and one day away from the biggest election of our lifetime, the 2024 election, and Donald Trump is not only closing fast, he is closing big. On Sunday night, Donald Trump held a rally at Madison Square Garden. He packed the house. 20,000 people showed up. There were tens of thousands of people in the streets outside. No real signs of protest. If you look at the behavior of the two campaigns, it is pretty clear whom both campaigns think is ahead. Donald Trump believes he’s ahead. Kamala Harris seems to believe that Trump is ahead — and you can tell because there’s a desperation play by the Kamala Harris campaign and her surrogates to call Trump Hitler. Tim Walz suggested that the Madison Square Garden rally was just like a Hitler rally. The inestimably stupid Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the same thing. Harris herself did a little speech from the vice presidential residence likening Trump to Hitler. That’s Harris’ closing pitch. It takes a lot of gall to see just what happened at Madison Square Garden on Sunday as some sort of Nazi rally. There were Israeli flags hanging from the rafters. There were tons of Orthodox Jews who showed up — and Orthodox Jews are going to vote for Donald Trump virtually unanimously. Everybody thinks that what Trump does at these rallies is very corny because he has Lee Greenwood singing “God Bless the U.S.A.,” because there are lots of American flags and lots of MAGA hats. It looks like a family reunion. That is the appeal. And that appeal can’t be understood by the more sophisticated set, but it is a very real appeal nonetheless. Trump was in a very good mood, joking about Harris being lost when her teleprompter broke. Last Friday, he went on Joe Rogan’s show, and he was great. He feels like he’s winning. The other evidence that Trump is winning is not just that he is happy and that the person campaigning happy tends to be the person who’s ahead, it’s also that Kamala Harris is clearly flailing. Harris was asked over the weekend by a reporter about the internal polling from her campaign and she answered that her internal polling was her “instinct,” adding, “I let the campaign people deal with all that other stuff.” But here’s the kicker: she doesn’t have any political instincts. She doesn’t have positions. Everything she does is poll-tested. Everything that she’s doing right now is a trial balloon, which she then immediately shoots down if it doesn’t get the response that she wants. Everything seems to be failing for her. She held a rally over the weekend and Beyoncé was supposed to show up. Tons of people showed up because they figured Beyoncé would perform and they would get a free Beyoncé concert. One problem: the packed crowd showed up and so did Beyoncé, who spoke for a couple of minutes, waved to the crowd and left. Nothing is working for Harris right now. And you can tell the preemptive sense of panic has totally set in among Democrats in a major way.

During his Madison Square Garden rally in New York City on Sunday, former President Donald Trump said he was running against “something far bigger” than Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump, who has a slight edge over Harris in national and top battleground state polls with just over a week until Election Day, talked about looking past the candidate and taking on what he described as the “radical Left machine” and the policy agency it wants to impress upon the U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP: ""We are not just running against Kamala — She means nothing.

During his remarks in the big Apple, Trump mocked Harris over her serving up word salads, not being more forthcoming about President’s Joe Biden’s health before he dropped out of the 2024 race this summer, and more. He quipped, “On issue after issue, Kamala broke it, but I will fix it,” getting cheers from the crowd. PRESIDENT TRUMP: On issue after issue, KAMALA BROKE IT—I WILL FIX IT. pic.twitter.com/DbyhTSCFIF — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) October 27, 2024 Still, Trump’s larger point in his speech was that Biden and Harris are “perfect vessels because they’ll never give them a hard time. He explained further, “They’ll do whatever they want. I know many of them. It’s just an amorphous group of people. But they’re smart and they’re vicious, and we have to defeat them. And when I say the ‘enemy from within,’ the other side go crazy.” Trump, who has long decried the “deep state” of bureaucrats and others frustrating his efforts at governance, said leftists “are doing such harm to our country with their open border policies, record-setting inflation, ‘Green New Scam,’ and everything else they are doing.

The polls are making a “potentially meaningful” shift in favor of former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris in the final stretch of the 2024 White House race, NBC News National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki said on Sunday. During a segment on “Meet The Press,” Kornacki explained the significance of four recent surveys — polls from CNBC, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Siena, and CNN — all of which either showed Trump slightly ahead nationally, or the candidates in a tie. NBC's Kornacki: I Don't Want To Overstate Poll Movement In Trump's Direction But It's Hard To Ignore Polls here – https://t.co/PaqCqgCEzj pic.twitter.com/qL1s06pA7v — RCP Video (@rcpvideo) October 27, 2024 “One thing we have noticed in the last couple days, this is not all of the polls that are out there now, but we have seen a number — four in the last four days — that have shown very small – but in the context of this close race, potentially meaningful — movement in Trump’s direction,” Kornacki said. “I don’t want to overstate it, but at the same time, it’s hard to ignore these four,” he added. “The CNBC poll came out the other day, has Trump ahead by 2. The Wall Street Journal poll, Trump ahead by 3. These are national numbers. Siena and the New York Times, a tied race. CNN, a tied race. The significance here is broader movement, again, we’re seeing in Trump’s direction.” Harris leads in the national polls, albeit by a shrinking margin, but in the battleground states that will be critical for securing 270 mark to win the Electoral College the margins are “absolutely razor thin,” Kornacki said, displaying a graphic showing Trump with the advantage in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina; Harris with the edge in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and a tie in Nevada. Nationally, Kornacki said, “We can show you from the CNBC poll, they picked up on something that our own NBC poll was suggesting recently, and that is a shift in the image of Kamala Harris. You could see right now in the CNBC poll, 42% positive, 48% negative. Higher negative than positive. That’s where Trump is too, largely: 39%, 49%. The significance is, about a month ago when we were polling this, Harris had a higher positive than negative. In our poll, in the CNBC poll, in other polls out there right now, we see Harris now with that negative going back above that positive rating.” Kornacki stressed that “tons of uncertainty and volatility remain in this race,” and he discussed how “from that CNBC poll, looking at this question of persuadable voters, defining them this way. How about this: 12% in the CNBC poll who currently say they support Harris or Trump say that they could change their mind, still, in this race. Another 6% say they’re undecided or currently going to vote for a third-party candidate. That’s a persuadable category of 18%. That’s getting close to one-in-five voters here. And the uncertainty is particularly acute for Donald Trump.” He added: “Maybe [Trump’s] made some gains here but his support continues to run deepest with voters who it is unclear if they’re actually going to turn out and vote. Look at it this way, from our NBC polling, a merge of all of our data, those who voted in the 2020 presidential election and the 2022 midterms, Harris with a 6-point lead. The most reliable bloc of voters. Those who only voted in the 2020 presidential, that’s where Trump opens up a lead. And then those who didn’t vote in either, that’s where Trump has his biggest advantage over Harris. Are they actually going to vote this time around? Huge question mark. Another way to look at it, we asked folks, scale of 1 to 10: your interest in this election. Again, look at this. Those who rate it the highest, 9 or 10, race is tied. Seven or 8, pretty high, Harris is ahead. Here’s where Trump cleans up: those who say 1 to 6.

Well ain't that rich?"" At the former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, his attorney and adviser, Alina Habba, spoke about the “lawfare” overshadowing the 2024 campaign. Habba, who walked onto the stage wearing a “MAGA” jacket to “trigger Hillary Clinton,” said the world first got to know the Republican candidate on courtroom steps as Trump faced various legal battles in New York City. “They thought they could take the greatest president down through lawfare, with lawsuits, fake charges, raids, and endless investigations,” Habba said. “They thought they could crush the man who built this city’s skyline,” she added. “But they underestimated how hard Trump would fight!” Trump Senior Advisor @AlinaHabba: “This is the party of strength, resilience, and a voice that echoes around the world. Our voices can not be silenced and this movement will not be stopped.” pic.twitter.com/nqiSiH8Zvw — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) October 27, 2024 Habba said the rally had “rattled some of my favorite swamp creatures,” whom she said were “scrambling and trying to call us Nazis and fascists.” She also said, “They are claiming we’re going to go after them and try to put them in jail. Well ain’t that rich?” After calling out Trump’s 2024 rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, saying, “Kamala, you want to talk about a fascist — no one has ever voted for you to become the Democrat nominee,” Habba exclaimed, “They tried to keep President Trump and his campaign in courtrooms being persecuted. But, do you know what he did while he was in those New York courtrooms? He won the hearts and minds of the American people all from this city!” She added, “You see the deep state, they underestimate how smart we are, and they want the American people to fall in like a bunch of sheep. You know what they don’t realize, New York? We’re going to be the ones herding sheep out of the White House on November 5. Because, Kamala Harris, you are getting evicted from my president’s house!” Habba was one of dozens of people lined up to speak at the rally in Madison Square Garden on Sunday. Trump is expected to deliver remarks, as is Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), Trump’s running mate; tech billionaire Elon Musk; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime Democrat who ran an independent campaign for president before joining forces with Trump; Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat congresswoman from Hawaii who recently joined the Republican Party; and many others.

The following is an edited transcript of an interview between Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief John Bickley and Newsweek’s Deputy Opinion Editor Batya Ungar-Sargon on the state of the U.S. Presidential race on a special Saturday edition of Morning Wire. In the final run-up to election day, the two presidential candidates are sharpening their pitch to voters. Donald Trump remains focused on the economy and immigration, while Kamala Harris seems to be shifting back to the Democrat message of Trump being a “danger to democracy.” But whose vision for the country resonates with more Americans? In this episode we speak with Batya Ungar-Sargon, deputy opinion editor at Newsweek about the stark contrasts between Trump and Harris. * * * JOHN: Joining us to discuss the current state of the presidential race, including the gender and class divide, is Batya Ungar-Sargon, author of “Second Class: How the Elites Betrayed America’s Working Men and Women.” Batya, great to have you back on. BATYA: Thank you so much for having me. It’s always such a pleasure and an honor to be with you. JOHN: Well, we love hearing that and having you on. First, we’ve seen a new article from The Atlantic that the legacy media has given a lot of weight to. It levels some ugly claims against Trump about supposedly praising Hitler’s generals and disparaging a slain soldier – it’s based on unnamed sources. Everyone on the record, however, has said it’s nonsense. What are we to make of this story and how the legacy media are approaching it just days out from the election? BATYA: It’s amazing, right? We’re right back where we started, “Trump is Hitler.” They just can’t keep away from it. And when they first trotted Kamala Harris out in what was nothing short of a coup against President Biden, replacing him with her at the top of the ticket, I think they thought she was going to emerge as some sort of phoenix from the ashes of the Democratic Party – as if we had never met Kamala Harris before, as if we didn’t know who she was. They really acted like this was a person no one had ever met. I think they believed that she was going to invigorate the base so powerfully that they could retire the “Trump is Hitler; Trump is a fascist; Trump is a threat to democracy.” Now that they are seeing she is actually just the Kamala Harris that we all know from her forays into politics over the last two decades, they’ve fallen back on what they think is their winning argument, which is “Trump is Hitler,” — which they had sort of promised to do away with, I think, in the wake of the first assassination attempt on his life. It really does smack of desperation, the fact that these are all unnamed sources; the fact that the allegations are exactly the same. The Atlantic had an article a couple weeks ago arguing Trump is Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, right? They’re trying to up the ante. And, of course, it’s so depressing because what it does is cheapen the impact Hitler actually had in this world. It cheapens who these people were, Mussolini and Stalin, by comparing them to somebody who’s, at the end of the day, a patriot and somebody who just wants the best for his country. I think we’re really seeing, both on the Left and on the Right, an inability to comprehend why Hitler was that bad. That’s really what we’ve gotten to. It’s not just that it engenders attempts on Donald Trump’s life, but it also really cheapens the history that a lot of people really suffered through. Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty Images JOHN: Meanwhile, we have Trump on the campaign trail serving fries to Americans and looking like a very relatable, non-threatening man who’s having a great time on the campaign trail. A lot of times you can see who’s winning by who’s having the most fun, right? Look, we keep hearing about the gender gap – you mentioned the identity question: “Women for Harris, men for Trump.” And a lot of polling does show this to be true. What do you see as the motivations behind that? BATYA: It’s interesting, because what we’re really seeing here is the class divide mapping onto the gender divide. Harris is appealing to college educated women and Donald Trump is appealing to working class men. Of course, this has a lot to do with the aesthetics of the campaign. You mentioned Trump at McDonald’s and what I found so amazing about that moment was he showed up in his suit and did not take off his tie. He put the McDonald’s apron over the costume of Donald Trump. I think what that really showed was that he did not think this was a degraded job. He did not think that you had to sort of dress down and be humiliated to take this job. He acted the part of a McDonald’s worker with a lot of dignity. And I think that is why people really responded to that image of him. He looked proud to be doing it. He looked happy to be doing it. And I really cannot think of another politician who could have pulled that off in that way. He stands with workers and you see the way in which his economic policy is designed for the working class: No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on social security. He promised he would reduce the corporate taxes of any company that reshores manufacturing from 21% to 15%. This is going to encourage radical reshoring of manufacturing. He said he’s going to appoint a czar to entice American businesses back to the United States. Of course, women work in factories. Of course, women do service industry jobs. Of course, women work jobs that have overtime. But they are jobs that require physical brawn and physicality, the kinds of jobs that used to deliver the American dream before the Democrats became the party of the college educated. Meanwhile you look at the Harris campaign and she really is targeting that female college educated sector of the population — people who have less economic insecurity, less economic struggle. People who are very, very invested in the question of abortion, honestly, to an extent that does not represent where the vast majority of Americans are at, the middle and the working class, who have a much more moderate view on abortion. This idea that abortion should be legal in all cases is very correlated with whether or not you have a college degree, and of course, women today in America are 15 points more likely to have that college degree. So it really reflects the way the Democrats have created an economy that really rewards women in a very big way. Win McNamee/Getty Images JOHN: Now, we’ve seen millions of dollars from the Harris campaign funneled into abortion-focused advertising. Do you think that’s having a positive effect for her campaign? BATYA: I think the elites care more about cultural issues and the working class cares more about economic issues at this point. The elites have more money and more time and more commitment as a result of that privilege to showing up and voting. So it was a very smart thing for her to do. Even though Donald Trump has promised that he would veto a national abortion ban, the Democrats are a much more natural party for people who believe in late-term abortions because Democratic politicians are unwilling to say what the upper limit on the right to an abortion should be. They refuse to give that. So even though it is Republicans whose view at this point, namely Donald Trump, reflects more where the American people are at because of this question of the bans that she has been able to, I think, successfully tar Republicans with, she’s really been able to mobilize that elite, over-credentialed, educated female vote. JOHN: Now, you mentioned the economic policies of Trump. Harris has presented some of her own policy proposals. Can you walk us through the differences there? BATYA: Absolutely. About one month in, she came out with an economic agenda she’s been calling an “opportunity economy.” And she had three main promises. The first was a massive investment in small businesses by way of tax cuts. People have sort of poked holes in that and said, “Well, a tax cut for a new business is not really going to help those people because they’re not going to have a lot of revenue those first few years,” which means that a tax cut is not going to help them very much. The second plank, she promised a $25,000 tax cut for first time homeowners, as well as cutting a lot of regulation around housing. And I think that that was actually a very smart plan from the cutting deregulation point of view, because, of course, we need much more housing. The reason people are finding it so hard to buy a home is just a sheer lack of supply. The problem with giving a $25,000 tax cut to first time homeowners is that it will increase demand. So there’s a real problem there. The experts on housing have said this is actually only going to make the problem worse because when you’re doing that you’re actually making more people able to buy homes, which means that this dwindling stock is going to become even more expensive. And the third idea that she had was just cribbed right from JD Vance, and it was a $6,000 tax cut for children for the first year of a child’s life. Of course, JD has said $5,000 and I believe it is unlimited for parents. So it was very interesting to me because from one point of view, this is not a great plan. It does reflect the Democrats overall view of how to help people who are struggling, which is instead of creating an economy that pays better to working class people, you sort of raise taxes on the rich and then redistribute that, which, of course, working class people don’t want that. They don’t want somebody else’s tax cuts. They don’t want welfare. They want much more of what Trump is offering, which is a protectionist economy, an economy that looks at the economy as a whole and says, ”How can we protect the labor of workers?” And Trump, of course, does that through tariffs, through, getting rid of free trade and then of course, through limiting the supply of labor through immigration control. Alex Wong/Getty Images JOHN: Speaking of immigration, I wanted to ask you about that next. There’s a stark difference between these two candidates on this – and this issue converges with the economy instantly. We’ve seen this playing out in all kinds of very specific ways – including with the Haitian migrants in some of these small towns that’s been highlighted in the debates. How is Harris trying to counter the immigration message? Is she doing an effective job at all? BATYA: I think she’s sort of thrown up her hands on it, honestly. She was sort of caught between a rock and a hard place because she was second in command in the Biden administration, which has been an absolute disaster for immigration. Opening the border and effectively allowing in 10 million undocumented immigrants to compete with Americans at the bottom end of the wage spectrum. And what’s actually worse is when they finally, finally — after three and a half years — decided to take executive action, what they did was create legal pathways to parole a whole bunch of people. So you don’t have the mess at the border anymore. They have actually paroled hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people into the country to compete legally with American workers. And of course, that is why this is happening. The gains that working class Americans had been seeing throughout the Trump presidency, and then in the post pandemic labor crunch, were halted immediately. And there’s just been precipitous wage losses now — wage theft, to be honest, from working class people because of all of these paroled people. So the Haitians in Springfield are part of that group. They were paroled into the country by the Biden administration, I believe, because he thought that halting working class wage growth was the only way to tamp inflation down and to get that stigma off of his administration. So when Trump shows up and says, “They’re eating the cats, they’re eating the dogs, they’re eating the pets of the people in Springfield,” they’re probably not eating their cats and their dogs. They’re not doing anything to the pets. What they’re doing is they’re taking the jobs. And to me, personally, that’s much more outrageous than eating the pets. JOHN: A lot of folks would agree. Now, final question: Energy was a focus for Trump in 2016 when he won. It’s a focus again now. Can you lay out the contrasts between these two candidates when it comes to energy policies? BATYA: It’s interesting. That’s Trump’s answer when people ask him, “How are you going to get inflation down?” And he says, I think accurately, “Energy is one of the biggest drivers of inflation.” Because, of course, there’s energy at stake in everything to do with groceries, everything to do with food, whether it’s growing it, transporting it, feeding cattle — everything. The cost of energy is going to be a huge driver in the cost of everything else. Trump wants to “drill baby drill.” He wants to use every method available. He wants us to be energy independent, which of course is a huge, huge contributor to the sovereignty of our nation. Kamala Harris was, at one time, a very big Green New Deal extremist, but like immigration, she sort of tried very hard not to talk about this topic because even the voters in her party are no longer there. Everybody wants to get back to this sort of very moderate center. So she has not been able to express where she stands on this issue, like many other issues, because in order to win now, she has to pivot far, far away from commitments she’s made in the past. I think this is why they call Trump “Hitler” day in and day out, because it is Trump who has the moderate middle position on every issue. You look at where Trump is at, whether it’s abortion, whether it’s unions, whether it’s courting black voters, whether it’s energy, whether it’s immigration, even mass deportations – every one of these positions where Trump has eked himself out, that is where 50, 60, 70% of Americans are at, and that is the real threat to the Democratic Party. JOHN: Batya, great to have you on again. BATYA: Thank you so much.

Former President Donald Trump said Friday that Vice President Kamala Harris had “finally lost” the Catholic vote after “unprecedented” targeting from the Democratic Party. Trump’s comments come after Harris told a reporter that she would not back religious exemptions to abortions and as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been pushing Catholics to back Trump’s candidacy. Polling has shown that Trump is backed by 61% of Protestant Christians and 52% of Catholic voters. “Kamala Harris has finally lost the Catholic vote. Her and the Democrat’s persecution of the Catholic Church is unprecedented! Her poll numbers have dropped like a rock, both with Catholics, and otherwise,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “What took so long?” CatholicVote recently rolled out a $250,000 ad campaign featuring RFK Jr. where he asks Catholics to unite behind Trump. The ad will air in Pennsylvania and other swing states. “President Trump has promised to take bold action on our economy, on the border, and on restoring children’s health. The Democratic Party has become the party of war, censorship, and corruption,” RFK Jr. says in the ad. “Catholics may disagree on many issues, but we must find a way to love our children more than we hate each other. I hope you’ll join me in supporting Donald Trump.” Trump’s Truth Social post also called out Harris, who has close ties to Planned Parenthood, for her full embrace of abortion. As attorney general of California, Harris raided the apartment of pro-life activist and Catholic David Daleiden after he released undercover footage exposing the sale of aborted babies’ body parts. “Kamala is DEMANDING LATE TERM ABORTION, in months 7, 8, and 9, and even execution after birth, and people aren’t buying it – and they never will. She is a Radical Left Lunatic!” Trump posted. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Trump’s post came two days after he criticized Harris over the persecution of Armenian Christians during the Biden-Harris administration. “Kamala Harris did NOTHING as 120,000 Armenian Christians were horrifically persecuted and forcibly displaced in Artsakh. Christians around the World will not be safe if Kamala Harris is President of the United States. When I am President, I will protect persecuted Christians, I will work to stop the violence and ethnic cleansing, and we will restore PEACE between Armenia and Azerbaijan,” he said. Data from the Pew Research Center indicates that Christians largely back Trump’s campaign, including 82% of white evangelicals, 58% of white non-evangelicals, and 61% of white Catholic voters.

Twice failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said during an interview this week that many voters like former President Donald Trump because they view him as “strong.” Clinton made the remarks Thursday night on CNN’s “The Source” with Kaitlan Collins while talking about the state of the upcoming election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. “Well, first of all, I don’t think she has Jim Comey in the wings waiting to kneecap her,” Clinton said. “So that’s good. And I’m very grateful for that.” Collins asked Clinton if she thought that there was a “double standard” in the race since Harris showed up for CNN’s recent town hall while Trump declined. “I really do, Kaitlan, and I see it as a double standard,” Clinton said, even though Trump has far outpaced Harris in the number of media interviews both candidates have given. “Thankfully, we’ve made progress when it comes to women in politics and certainly seeking the highest office in the land,” she said. “But there still is a double standard, and I think there’s also a double standard because it still is very difficult to cover Donald Trump.” When asked why Trump has seen a surge in support, Clinton said it’s because those who are backing him “think that he offers a better deal” for their economic future. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 She said that many like his “belligerent attitude” toward the system while others “find him to be a strong man, and that’s very attractive to certain voters.” “They may not even agree with what he’s saying, but they think that he’s strong, and they find that appealing,” she added.

Twice failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed this week that former President Donald Trump was trying to reenact an infamous Nazi rally in the U.S. from the 1930s with one of his upcoming political events. Clinton made the inflammatory remarks Thursday night during an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins when Collins asked Clinton if she believed Trump was a “fascist.” “You know, Kaitlan, I do,” Clinton said, later adding, “Sadly here in America, the term fits.” “And one other thing that you’ll see next week, Kaitlan, is Trump actually re-enacting the Madison Square Garden rally in 1939,” Clinton said. “President Franklin Roosevelt was appalled that neo-Nazis, fascists in America, were lining up to essentially pledge their support for the kind of government that they were seeing in Germany.” The New York Post noted that the venue hosted the Democratic National Convention in 1924, 1976, 1980, and 1992 — the year that former President Bill Clinton went on to win his first term in office. “So I don’t think we can ignore it. Now, it may be a leap for some people and a lot of others may think, I don’t want to go there,” she added. “I don’t want to say that.

The New York Times warned on Friday that Vice President Kamala Harris may be in trouble after its latest poll found her tied nationally with former President Donald Trump. The Times and Siena College poll of 2,516 likely voters from October 20-23 found Harris and Trump tied at 48% as Americans remain pessimistic about the state of the country. The poll brought the RealClearPolitics average of the contest between Harris and Trump to a tie at 48.5%. “The result, coming less than two weeks before Election Day, and as millions of Americans have already voted, is not encouraging for Ms. Harris,” the Times wrote of its most recent poll, adding, “[Democrats] have been looking to Ms. Harris to build a strong national lead as a sign that she would do well in such critical swing states as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.” One of the troubling signs was that only 28% of those surveyed believed that the country was headed in the right direction. “And voters continue to be pessimistic about the direction of the country, a measure that historically has been a danger sign for the party in power,” the outlet noted. The Times said that Harris appears to have weakened among likely voters since its last poll. “Ms. Harris’s position, if anything, may have declined among likely voters since the last Times/Siena College poll, taken in early October. At the time, she had a slight lead over Mr. Trump, 49 percent to 46 percent. The change is within the margin of error, but The Times’s national polling average has registered a tightening in polls over the past few weeks as well, suggesting at the very least that this contest has drawn even closer.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 The top issues for the voters were the economy (27%), immigration (15%), and abortion (15%). On Those issues, Trump was trusted more on the economy (52%-45%) and immigration (54%-43%) while Harris was trusted more on abortion (55%-40%). “I was very, extremely disappointed in her response to our immigration issue,” 27-year-old Larrissa Alexander told the Times. “And when she was first elected, that was one of the things that she was tasked with handling. And she accepted that responsibility. And then every time she was asked about it or pressed about it, it just was attitude-giving in return.” The poll found a large gap between male and female support for both Trump and Harris.

"52","https://www.dailywire.com/news/days-before-election-media-launches-desperate-anti-trump-hoax","Days Before Election, Media Launches Desperate Anti-Trump Hoax","They are clearly convinced they're going to lose this election, and they're throwing everything at the wall, hoping that it will stick. Three years ago, The Atlantic magazine published a longform article that took a lot of people by surprise. It was entitled, “THE GREAT (FAKE) CHILD-SEX-TRAFFICKING EPIDEMIC.” It dismissed the supposed “moral panic” among conservatives on the issue, saying it amounted to an “Internet conspiracy theory.” The Atlantic published this piece just days after a CNN staffer was arrested for attempting to persuade minors to engage in unlawful sexual activity. It was also published while the Ghislaine Maxwell trial was going on. Maxwell, of course, conspired with Jeffrey Epstein to operate a sex-trafficking ring that exploited multiple children over the course of a decade. And the piece in The Atlantic came after several reports indicating that the United States, thanks largely to its open southern border, is one of the top destinations for child-sex trafficking in the world. So why would The Atlantic run that article? That’s a question that still hasn’t been answered. Could it be, these “internet conspiracy theorists” wondered, that some of the wealthiest and powerful people in this country — like the people who run The Atlantic — might have some ulterior motive to downplay child-sex trafficking? If so, then we can be sure of one thing: a lot of very powerful and wealthy people are panicking right now. Donald Trump clearly has the momentum on his side. And this is the same Trump who, just a month ago, promised to release the full and unredacted list of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients. He said we would allow the public to know who exactly visited Epstein’s private island, which is a piece of information that the government has fought to conceal. That brings us to yesterday’s alleged bombshell in The Atlantic magazine, which may be the single most desperate attempt at an “October Surprise” in the history of American politics. Here’s a summary: So the article from Jeffrey Goldberg makes two central claims. First, Trump said he wanted generals like Hitler’s. And second, he complained about the funeral costs for a slain service member, saying he doesn’t like the idea of spending a lot of money on a Mexican. And then I guess he said, “This is MAGA country.” It’s honestly not even worth going through the effort of debunking this — and not just because it sounds like a cliche that Jussie Smollett would come up with if you tell him to invent a way to smear Donald Trump. Maybe 20 years ago, in a different era when people actually trusted the news media, an article like this would convince some people. But we’ve been through so many high-profile media-driven hoaxes at this point that everyone already assumes this story is false, without even reading it or hearing anything else about it. In fact, several of those high-profile media-driven hoaxes came from Jeffrey Goldberg. He was one of the leading propagandists pushing for the Iraq War. He was also a major source of Russiagate lies. More recently, you’ve probably heard about Goldberg’s article claiming that Trump called fallen soldiers “suckers and losers” when he visited a French cemetery, if only because every Democrat repeats that story as much as possible at every opportunity. That article cited an anonymous source that’s widely believed to be John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff at the time. Not a single person went on-the-record to confirm it. Instead, a lot of Trump officials — including people who hate Trump, like John Bolton — denied that Trump had said it. And John Bolton was on the trip to France with Trump, when the comment was supposedly made. But none of that matters to smear merchants like Jeffrey Goldberg. His job is to serve the interests of the Defense Department and the security state, which are profoundly threatened by the possibility of another Trump presidency. So Goldberg launders these hoaxes relentlessly. And that’s what Jeffrey Goldberg is doing, once again, with this Hitler “October surprise.” Except in this case, it’s not really even a “surprise.” Two years ago, a book quoted John Kelly — the same guy who was probably behind the “suckers and losers” smear — saying that Trump wanted his generals to be like Hitler’s. A bunch of outlets wrote up stories about it, just in time for the midterms. NBC News, for example, reported: Former President Donald Trump once complained to his White House chief of staff that his generals weren’t ‘totally loyal’ like Adolf Hitler’s during World War II, according to a book excerpt published Monday. ‘You f—-ing generals, why can’t you be like the German generals?’ Trump asked then-White House chief of staff John Kelly, according to an excerpt of ‘The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,’ co-written by New Yorker staff writer Susan Glasser and New York Times correspondent Peter Baker. That was back in 2022. So now we’re doing a re-run of this same exact hit job. This is the laziest “October Surprise” that’s ever been attempted. It doesn’t even qualify as a surprise. But predictably, Kamala Harris is pretending it is a surprise. Yesterday she spoke outside the vice president’s residence, in what can only be described as a completely deranged attempt to rile up as many lunatics as possible in an election year when two people have already tried to murder Trump. Watch: On X, Kamala Harris’ account doubled down on this rhetoric. Whoever’s running the account wrote: Donald Trump is out for unchecked power. He wants a military like Adolf Hitler had, who will be loyal to him, not our Constitution. He is unhinged, unstable, and given a second term, there would be no one to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses. There’s really no other way to look at this. Kamala Harris is laying the groundwork for preventing Trump from becoming president if he wins the election. She’s also inciting someone to assassinate him in the meantime. She’s openly saying he’s going to turn America into Nazi Germany. If she really believed that — and more importantly, if the deep state that controls Kamala Harris really believes that — then we can’t be surprised by anything they try to do. This is a very dangerous moment. The entirety of the Biden-Harris administration is now pushing this rhetoric. Here’s the press secretary yesterday: There’s just so much flagrant lying in that one clip. The “dictator on day one” quote, which we’ve heard about a million times, isn’t even close to what Trump said. He was asked, explicitly, to respond to claims he’d be a dictator. And then he joked that he wouldn’t be, “except for day one,” when he’d close the border and lift moratoriums on oil drilling. He’s referring to the executive orders he’d sign on his first day and of course, in context, he was joking around. They’re pretending like he seriously announced that, beginning on day one and continuing throughout his entire presidency, he’d be a dictator. It’s not even close to what happened. And it’s especially outrageous considering this is coming from the party that plans to censor Americans to fight “misinformation”. The latest Jeffrey Goldberg smear isn’t any better. The claim is that Trump praised Hitler as a role model and yet John Kelly, the source of this story, did not resign, did not reveal this publicly, did not say anything about it for years. He left the White House in January 2019. The book where he makes the Hitler claim came out in 2022. Why didn’t Kelly think to mention something like that sooner? Why does he only mention it right before elections? Of course, the bigger problem with making “Trump is Hitler” into your closing argument is that we all experienced four years of Trump in office. Even if the guy had a shrine to Hitler where he burned incense and offered sacrifices every night, the fact would still remain that he did not govern in an authoritarian way at all. As I’ve pointed out many times, his flaw was the opposite. He was, if anything, too hesitant to wield power. That’s a mistake I’m hoping he doesn’t make if he gets a second chance. Trump ran the most restrained presidential administration in modern American history. And they still call him a fascist dictator. If that’s the case, he may as well go in and wield power ruthlessly (yet constitutionally). As many of our parents used to say back in the old days: he should give them something to cry about. Beyond the Hitler allegation, there are about a million other holes in this Atlantic story. Each one of these problems, independently, was reason enough to kill the story. Specifically, Jeffrey Goldberg also claims that Trump offered to pay the funeral expenses for Vanessa Guillén, a 20-year-old Army private who was murdered by a fellow soldier at Fort Hood, in Texas. Later, when Trump was told that the expenses totaled $60,000, the Atlantic reports that Trump said, ‘It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f—— Mexican!'” So there’s no on-the-record source for this claim. But there are a lot of people who are going on the record denying it. Mayra Guillén, the sister of the victim, wrote: Wow. I don’t appreciate how you are exploiting my sister’s death for politics- hurtful & disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members. President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family & Vanessa. In fact, I voted for President Trump today. A translator who was in the room with Trump and the family, along with the family’s attorney, said the same thing: After having dealt with hundreds of reporters in my legal career, this is unfortunately the first time I have to go on record and call out Jeffrey Goldberg@the Atlantic: not only did he misrepresent our conversation but he outright LIED in HIS sensational story. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 And it gets worse. Ben Williamson, who served as a communications adviser in the Trump White House, posted screenshots of his text messages with The Atlantic. He says they deliberately misrepresented what he told them in the article: I sent Atlantic a comment saying President Trump ‘absolutely did not say that,’ referring to the alleged comments about Ms. Guillén they printed. [The] Atlantic translated that comment to ‘didn’t hear Trump say it.’ Treat this dishonest piece accordingly. It goes on and on. Yesterday Jeffrey Goldberg was asked about the family’s reaction to his piece. And he basically said they don’t know what they’re talking about. Watch: So the smoking gun is apparently that Trump didn’t personally pay for the funeral. That’s supposed to convince us that Trump called this woman an “f—ing Mexican.” But those two accusations aren’t remotely related. And the accusation that Trump didn’t pay for the funeral loses a lot of its impact when the family repeatedly says that Trump treated them extremely graciously, throughout all of their interactions. None of these smears make any sense. They are clearly convinced that they’re going to lose this election, and they’re throwing everything at the wall, hoping that it will stick. That explains why the Guardian just ran with another desperate hack job: A former model who says she met Donald Trump through the late sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein has accused the former president of groping and sexually touching her in an incident in Trump Tower in 1993, in what she believed was a ‘twisted game’ between the two men. … [Stacey] Williams, who is 56 and a native of Pennsylvania, has shared parts of her allegation on social media posts in the past, but revealed details about the alleged encounter on a call on Monday organized by a group called Survivors for Kamala, which supports Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. So this is an alleged episode that happened more than 30 years ago. It never came up either of the two previous times Trump ran for president. Instead, this is just coming out now, with less than two weeks to go until the election — an election Trump looks like he’s going to win. It’s from a woman who, according to the Trump campaign and various reports, was a former Obama activist. And the allegation was first revealed during a pro-Kamala Harris event that was organized by a campaign group that’s currently taking out anti-Trump advertisements in the New York Times. Additionally, there’s no actual proof of any of these allegations in the article. There’s a postcard and a note that suggests Trump at one point spoke to this woman. Strangely, though, the note is signed with a signature that looks very different from Trump’s other signatures from that time period. It looks more like Trump’s signature today. And there are other problems, too. Here’s a clip of a portion of the accuser’s statement: One of the big issues here is that, as Zerohedge pointed out, Jeffrey Epstein didn’t move into that particular mansion until 1996. That’s documented all over the place, including in The New York Times and Vanity Fair. So how was Epstein leaving his brownstone apartment there, three years earlier? I guess that’s something for the fact-checkers to look into. With all these red flags, obviously this allegation isn’t going to convince anyone of anything. But it does highlight one of the many differences between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, which is that Trump is the only candidate who has promised to provide transparency about Jeffrey Epstein and his clients. He’s made it one of his core campaign promises. And that makes you wonder: Is Donald Trump trying to incriminate himself by releasing the Epstein client list? Or is it more likely that Trump’s political opponents are accusing him — with increasing panic — of exactly the thing they’re guilty of? What we do know for sure is that these people are going to get increasingly desperate and deranged between now and Election Day. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the next two weeks will be unlike any other in American history. No one can possibly be prepared for the sheer amount of unhinged lying and panic that’s about to unfold. After two impeachments, two assassination attempts, and hundreds of hoaxes, Donald Trump appears to be on the verge of retaking the White House. And right now — unfortunately for hacks like Jeffrey Goldberg and the deep state that Trump has vowed to dismantle — it looks increasingly like nothing they say can stop it. * * * This article has been edited for clarity.

'I cannot figure it out...' Senator Mike Lee sharply criticized Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Thursday for reportedly offering “scathing” remarks about former President Donald Trump and the “MAGA movement.” McConnell slams Trump as a “narcissist” and a “sleazeball” in his forthcoming biography, according to CNN, adding that Trump has “done a lot of damage to our party’s image and our ability to compete.” Speaking to The Daily Wire Thursday, Lee slammed the Kentucky Republican for his comments. “Openly hurting him, it’s just baffling to me,” Lee said. “I cannot figure it out… number one, he’s a Republican senator. Number two, he’s the Senate Republican leader. Number three, we are less than two weeks away from a general election in which these guys are in tight races.” McConnell reportedly also says that “Trump is appealing to people who haven’t been as successful as other people and providing an excuse for that, that these more successful people have somehow been cheated, and you don’t deserve to think of yourself as less successful because things haven’t been fair.” “If senate Republican leaders are going to come out and do these sorts of things, we need to have a conversation about it,” Lee said. “And we especially need to have a conversation between those who are running for Senate Republican leadership posts.” The Utah Republican reiterated his criticism in an X thread Thursday. 🧵 1.

"54","https://www.dailywire.com/news/all-of-the-democrats-october-surprises-against-trump-have-fallen-apart","All Of The Democrats’ ‘October Surprises’ Against Trump Have Fallen Apart","All three claims against Trump this week have been ripped apart instantly With less than two weeks until Election Day, Democrats and their media allies have thrown out multiple allegations against former President Donald Trump that immediately fell apart under basic scrutiny. The first two allegations were featured in a single article in The Atlantic, one from anonymous sources denied by on-the-record insiders who were present, and the other from former White House chief of staff John Kelly, whose claims have also been denied by others. The Atlantic article, by the outlet’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, began with a claim from anonymous sources that Trump, as president, “became angry” when he learned how much a funeral for a murdered soldier would cost. Trump had spoken to the soldier’s family and offered to help pay funeral costs after 20-year-old Vanessa Guillén was killed by a fellow soldier at Fort Hood in April 2020. But Goldberg cited anonymous “attendees” and “contemporaneous notes of the meeting taken by a participant” to claim that Trump was angered when the family sent the White House a funeral bill for $60,000. Trump, according to Goldberg’s anonymous sources, told his staff, “It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f***ing Mexican!” People who were in the room have since come out to deny the claim, including Guillén’s sister and the family attorney, as well as Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows. Meadows’ former spokesman also told The Atlantic that Trump “absolutely did not say that,” but Goldberg wrote in his article that the spokesman “denied having heard Trump make the statement.” The story was already hard to believe because anyone willing to disparage Trump would not need to hide behind anonymity to make such a claim. People who disparage Trump are given media positions, book deals, and praised as heroes, so it makes no sense Goldberg would need to provide anonymity to anyone. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 The second allegation in Goldberg’s article was from Kelly, who has a history of making wild allegations against Trump without evidence. Kelly alleged that Trump would regularly praise Adolf Hitler’s generals – a claim he made to reporters writing an anti-Trump book in 2022 as well. The timing of Kelly’s alleged recollection of the claims is notable – just two weeks before the election, he suddenly remembers conversations with Trump from more than four years earlier. Despite the questionable sourcing, the claim allowed the media and Vice President Kamala Harris to rehash their tired “Trump is Hitler” accusations, with Harris even calling a press conference to make the claim. On Wednesday, two former advisers to Vice President Mike Pence’s also disputed Kelly’s claims, The Daily Wire reported. Pence’s former National Security Adviser, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg and his chief of staff Nick Ayers, both publicly denied Kelly’s claims. “Vice President Harris is a fraud. I was in the White House at a senior level much longer than General Kelly. He is complicit in this fraud and has lied to the American people. His lies, as well as John Bolton’s, are a disservice to [the] Nation at this critical time. So are the VP’s,” Kellogg wrote on X. Ayers also called Kelly’s claims “patently false.” “I’ve avoided commenting on intra-staff leaks or rumors or even lies as it relates to my time at the White House but General Kelly’s comments regarding President Trump are too egregious to ignore,” Ayers said on X. “I was with each of them more than most, and his commentary is *patently false.*” Finally, former model Stacey Williams alleged during a Harris campaign event that Trump had groped her 31 years ago. The timing of her allegation – just two weeks before the election – and the forum in which she made it – a “Survivors for Harris” campaign event – call into question the validity of her claim. Trump has been famous for five decades, and the claim was never mentioned during his previous two presidential campaigns. Multiple women have come forward with dubious claims of harassment against him, yet she waited until 2024 to make hers. Her allegation also attempted to tie Trump closer to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, even though there is more evidence that prominent Democrats were close to Epstein than Trump. Williams is also a former activist for President Barack Obama, making her claims even more questionable. And they were published in The Guardian, the same outlet that published dubious sexual assault allegations against Trump just before the 2020 election – accusations that couldn’t get traction from legacy American news outlets. Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the story in no uncertain terms: “These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false. It’s obvious this fake story was contrived by the Harris campaign.” Journalist Mark Halperin also said on his podcast “The Morning Meeting” this week that he and likely others have been pitched a story that, if true, would “end Donald Trump’s campaign” but added that he didn’t believe the story was true. “Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic just happened to publish his story two weeks before the election with accusations against Donald Trump, some of which have been disputed for the first time, some of which have been disputed for quite some time. And the point I was making is there’s all sorts of things being floated out there. Maybe Jeffrey Goldberg just happened to finish the story two weeks before the election,” Halperin said. “I know of one story that’s been pitched to a major newspaper and to me, and for all I know, to many others, that I don’t believe is true,” he added. “But if it’s true, as I said yesterday, it would end Donald Trump’s campaign, just as if the accusations, now thoroughly debunked, contributed by American intelligence to Russia about Tim Walz, if those were true, it would end his campaign.” Halperin didn’t say who was pitching the likely false story or what the story was in order to discredit it if a less scrupulous outlet publishes the claim. “What we’re seeing in the final days — is the point I was making — is, actors who want a certain outcome, are on social media and in pitches to reporters, and in the case of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, writing himself, are trying to affect the end of the race because they’re so desperate to try to pull a Comey,” Halperin continued, referring to former FBI Director James Comey reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server just days before the 2016 election.

Utah Senator Mike Lee criticized Vice President Kamala Harris and other top Democrats for comparing Donald Trump to Hitler, arguing that such rhetoric invites attacks on the former president. “I find it troubling,” he told The Daily Wire on Thursday, “especially because, to me, it feels like trolling for assassins.” “When you’re constantly calling him Hitler,” Lee said, “that’s really dangerous.” “I’m not one who thinks that no one can ever make a Hitler comparison or at least draw upon it, but when you identify him as much as they have with Hitler, you characterize him that way, it tends to leave a lot of people feeling morally justified in doing or saying things they wouldn’t otherwise do or say.” On Wednesday, Harris spoke from the White House where she argued that “Trump said he wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had,” adding, “he wants a military that is not loyal to the Constitution, but loyal to him… This is a window into who Donald Trump really is from the people who know him best.” Haris’s remarks referred to a highly criticized Atlantic piece in which one anonymous source claimed that Trump mocked a dead soldier and praised Hitler’s generals. The piece has been widely denounced by the deceased soldier’s sister, as well as people in Trump’s circles, as false and “dishonest.” On the left: I sent Atlantic a comment saying President Trump “absolutely did not say that,” referring to the alleged comments about Ms. Guillen they printed.

Two former senior advisers for Vice President Mike Pence strongly refuted General John Kelly’s claims that Donald Trump once praised Adolf Hitler’s generals during a discussion with White House officials. An article written by The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg quoted Kelly, Trump’s former chief of staff, who accused Trump of saying he wanted the “generals that Hitler had.” According to Kelly, who has disparaged Trump in the past, the former president was fond of Hitler’s generals because they “were totally loyal to him.” Kelly served as Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary for six months in 2017 before Trump tapped him to serve as his chief of staff from July 2017 until January 2019. Kelly’s comments to The Atlantic led to Vice President Kamala Harris holding a short press conference on Wednesday where she slammed Trump, saying, “It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler.” Later on Wednesday during a town hall with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Harris called the Republican nominee a “fascist.” Retired General Keith Kellogg — Pence’s former National Security Adviser — and Nick Ayers, Pence’s former chief of staff — released statements on Wednesday blasting the general’s claims. “Vice President Harris is a fraud. I was in the White House at a senior level much longer than General Kelly. He is complicit in this fraud and has lied to the American people.

"57","https://www.dailywire.com/news/october-surprise-media-launch-ugliest-anti-trump-smears-yet","October Surprise! Media Launch Ugliest Anti-Trump Smears Yet","The more you throw at him, the more he just looks like Donald Trump. We are now less than two weeks out from Election Day. The state of the race is that Donald Trump appears to be ahead going into the homestretch. In fact, poll analyst reporter Mark Halperin said as much yesterday, claiming that if the early voting numbers hold up the way they are right now, and if the date of voting goes the way that it did in 2020, Trump will have wrapped up this election before the Election Day even begins — because Democrats basically need to win it in the pregame or they’re going to lose it day of. Halperin explained, saying: Let’s lead with the lead, as they say in journalism. If the early vote numbers stay the way they are, and that’s a big if, we’ll almost certainly know before Election Day who’s going to win the election. We’re going to talk a lot about that: the reasons why Democrats might be underperforming, the prospect that they’ll recover. But again, make no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, we’ll know that Donald Trump’s going to be president on Election Day. Halperin’s not the only one saying this. The Washington Post reported on this yesterday as well: Dozens of states have opened in-person early-voting locations, and turnout has been robust. In Georgia, more than 1.6 million people had cast in-person ballots by midmorning Tuesday — nearly one-third of the total vote from four years ago. North Carolina hit 1.4 million Tuesday, the sixth day of early voting. And in Nevada, Republicans voting in person have outnumbered Democrats — a reversal from four years ago. Nationwide, more than 18 million Americans have cast ballots in person or by mail. Republican participation is radically up from where it was in 2020, after Trump encouraged people not to vote early. Now, tons of Republicans are voting early, and that means in states like Nevada, there are serious danger signs for Democrats. Attorney Jon Ralston, an excellent reporter at the Nevada Independent, has noted that since the rise of the political machine that late former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid built for Democrats, this has never happened. The Republican turn out amounts are unprecedented in modern times, leading early voting in Nevada. Harris is running really, really weak in the early voting thus far. Again, it could be that that’s cannibalizing the day of voting. It’s possible the people who are voting right now are people who would have normally voted on Election Day, or it’s possible that Republicans have actually gotten smart and many of the people who weren’t going to show up on Election Day are now voting early just to get it done. By the way, if you are voting early, that is good because the party for which you are voting can see that you have voted. They don’t have to waste campaign resources door knocking if they already know that you voted. A senior official working on Harris’s campaign is already sounding the alarm about the Veep’s narrowing electoral path. According to NBC News, three sources with knowledge of the campaign strategy say the campaign is worried the blue wall could at least, in part, go red this November. One senior campaign official told NBC there’s been a thought that Michigan or Wisconsin may fall off and North Carolina may no longer be in reach. If the Democrats lose North Carolina and Michigan or Wisconsin, it is difficult to see how they will win the election because, at that point, they would have to peel off Georgia. Politico is reporting the same, pointing out that time is ticking off the clock for Harris: Vice President Kamala Harris and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney descended on the crucial Milwaukee suburbs Monday night and, sitting side by side, delivered compelling political sermons. The problem was they were preaching to the converted.The event was explicitly aimed at those moderates and onetime Republicans who remain up for grabs, and may decide the election, but the rhetoric seemed better suited for those in the audience wearing “The Lincoln Project” and “,LA” t-shirts. They’ve got a problem on their hands, and so it is now time to pull out all the stops, which could be that Harris could run a better campaign. That, of course, is highly unlikely. She’s not going to run a better campaign because she’s not a good candidate. Hilariously, there was an op-ed in The Hill two days ago wondering if perhaps Joe Biden was, after all, a better candidate than Kamala Harris, which of course, is what Joe Biden has been saying all along, despite being dead.Kamala Harris, for her part, can’t even answer simple questions as to whether Biden is sentient and alive. She will not answer questions on the decline of the person she shoved off the back of the train and stole the nomination of. In an interview with NBC News, Harris attempted to explain Joe Biden’s mental state when pointblank asked about him: JACKSON: You have made it clear that you believe this is a binary choice between you and Donald Trump. That’s — those are candidates that are on the ballot, of course. HARRIS: There’s only two choices…yes. JACKSON: Of course, yes, but, and I know that Joe Biden is not on the ballot, I understand that, but the reason that you are at the top of the ticket is because he dropped out of this race. And so I want to ask you, and it was largely because of that debate performance back in June. You defended him in the days before and in the days after, as you were campaigning for another four years for President Biden. Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those moments with President Biden, as you were with him again and again, repeatedly in that time? HARRIS: Of course. Joe Biden is an — extremely accomplished, experienced and capable in every way that anyone would want of their president. Absolutely. JACKSON: And you never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? HARRIS: It was a bad debate. People have bad debates. That — he is absolutely… JACKSON: But that’s the reason why you’re here, and he’s not running for the top of the ticket. HARRIS: Well, you’d have to ask him if that’s the only reason why. JACKSON: What do you think? HARRIS: I am running for President of the United States. Joe Biden is not, and my presidency will be about bringing a new generation of leadership to America that is focused on the work that we need to do, to invest in the ambitions and aspirations of the American people. This lady has absolutely nothing. The reason that she has lost all steam is because she has nothing. She cannot even answer the simple question, “Why are you in that chair and Joe Biden isn’t in that chair?” — when everyone in America knows the answer to that question, including, of course, Kamala Harris. Harris has basically been relegated to throwing out bribes to various constituency groups. Just a couple of weeks ago, she pledged to hand out $20,000 to black people in forgivable loans. She is now doing the same for Latinos because she’s been losing Latino votes. In a statement yesterday, she wrote: Donald Trump has disrespected and insulted Latino men in communities. As president, I will invest in them.” What does that mean? It means that she will “help Latino men and others start and grow small businesses with no interest loans or deferred loan repayments, and fully forgivable loans up to $20k. Bribery. We are now in the realm of open bribery. By the way, you are not allowed to give out government grants by race. That is illegal in the United States. This is her campaign and it’s failing. Now the time has come for October surprises. The Democrats have a problem when it comes to surprises with Trump. This has been true for years because Trump is a monster made out of mud. When you throw more mud at a monster made out of mud, it turns out he just looks like a monster made out of mud. Trump is the black socks of presidential candidates. Black socks never get dirty. The longer you wear them, the blacker they get. That is who Donald Trump is. The more you throw at him, the more he just looks like Donald Trump because he is the most well-established political figure in the American mind in my lifetime — and my parents lifetime as well. There is no one in America who does not have an opinion about Trump right now. The question for undecided voters is not what they think about Trump. The question is what they think about Harris. Trump’s numbers have been incredibly steady for the entirety of this election cycle. In polling, Trump’s national average polling has been between 46% and 48% of the entirety of this race. Meanwhile, there is much more variability for Harris. So, the Democrats are getting desperate.

Since 2020, every candidate the Democratic Party has nominated for president since 2000 has actively backed restrictions on free speech online, according to a new analysis from the Media Research Center shared with The Daily Wire. “Since the 2020 election cycle, no less than seven of the most recent 10 presidential nominees have called for censorship and/or government regulation of political speech,” MRC researcher Luis Cornelio found wrote in his analysis. MRC Free Speech For America analyzed the comments and positions of every presidential candidate since 2000. The group found that every Democrat — and just one Republican — who ran for office in that time frame has backed some kind of restriction on speech since 2020, whether banning “misinformation” or pushing for the government to crack down on free expression. That includes former President Barack Obama, President Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the last of whom has advocated censorship for years. Harris has pushed for social media companies to remove posts from former President Donald Trump and demanded more government oversight and regulation for social media companies. “They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation, and that has to stop,” Harris told CNN in 2019. The report found that former President Donald Trump had taken steps to promote free speech, citing his efforts in 2020 to define Section 230 — a provision that largely gives tech companies immunity for what third parties allow on their platforms — in a way that protected the First Amendment. Mitt Romney, who ran for president in 2012, is the only Republican the MRC found to have “voiced support for censorship and against the American principles of free speech online.” The Biden-Harris administration used several federal agencies to censor speech related to the COVID-19 vaccine, MRC previously documented. This came as Biden claimed that Facebook was “killing people” by allowing posts critical of the COVID vaccine. “They’re killing people — I mean they’re really, look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated,” Biden said on July 16, 2021. “And they’re killing people.” Hillary Clinton, who has long blamed her 2016 loss to Trump on so-called Russian disinformation, has proposed arresting Americans for spreading “propaganda.” “I think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda, and whether they should be civilly or even in some cases, criminally charged is something that would be a better deterrence,” Clinton said on MSNBC last month. Earlier this month, Clinton urged for social media companies to “moderate” posts, saying on CNN that if “they don’t moderate and monitor content, we lose total control.” “We should be, in my view, appealing something called Section 230, which gave platforms on the internet immunity because they were thought to be pass-throughs that they shouldn’t be judged for the content that is posted—but we now know that was an overly simple view,” she said. Obama said back on April 21, 2022 that protecting “democracy” meant more government regulations for online speech. “Each of us, whether we work at a tech company or consume social media, whether we are a parent, a legislator, an advertiser on one of these platforms, now’s the time to pick a side,” Obama said at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center. “We have a choice right now. Do we allow our democracy to wither or do we make it better?” Last month, John Kerry, who lost the White House to George W. Bush in 2004, asserted that the First Amendment was a major impediment to fighting alleged online misinformation. “But look, if people only go to one source, and the source they go to is sick, and, you know, has an agenda, and they’re putting out disinformation, our First Amendment stands as a major block to be able to just, you know, hammer it out of existence,” he said during a World Economic Forum meeting. Vice President Al Gore, who has made a fortune pushing fear about climate change, compared social media algorithms to AR-15 rifles in December 2023 and called for them to be banned if they lead people in a certain direction. “If you have social media that is dominated by algorithms that pull people down these rabbit holes that are a bit like pitcher plants, these algorithms, they are the digital equivalent of AR-15s,” Gore said. “They ought to be banned, they really ought to be banned. It’s an abuse of the public forum.” Romney, the only Republican on the list, was included because of comments he made during a congressional hearing in July 2023 where he seemed to endorse federal government employees pressuring tech companies to restrict certain posts. “Employees of the federal government have First Amendment rights, too,” Romney said. “Censorship is when the government shuts something off. This is arguing to try to convince somebody else to shut it off and that’s the right people have whether they’re in government or outside of government.” Already have an account?

Former President Donald Trump ripped Democrat senators on Wednesday for attempting to tie themselves to some of his policies as they seek re-election. Sens. Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Jon Tester (D-MT), who are all running against Republicans in tight races, have released ads promoting their support of certain Trump administration policies, Axios reported. Trump slammed the senators in a post on Truth Social, saying they “only pretend” to support his policies “when Elections roll around.” “Kamala Harris’ sinking Campaign has become so TOXIC, that Democrat Senators in four different States are using me in their advertisements, and stating that they are with President Trump on Tariffs, and numerous other things. While it is a great compliment, it is not fair to those Republican Senate Candidates, Bernie Moreno, Dave McCormick, Eric Hovde, and Sam Brown, who are with me all the time,” Trump wrote. “These Democrats have voted with Crooked Joe Biden almost 100% of the time. They only pretend to be on my side when Elections roll around. OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN, NEVADA: VOTE FOR BERNIE MORENO, DAVE MCCORMICK, ERIC HOVDE, AND SAM BROWN – THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE WITH US!” In a Casey ad that was released last week, the narrator says that “Casey bucked Biden to protect fracking and he sided with Trump to end NAFTA and put tariffs on China to stop them from cheating.” A Baldwin ad states, “Tammy Baldwin got President Trump to sign her Made in America bill.” An ad released earlier this year says that Brown “wrote a bill that Donald Trump signed to crack down on drugs at the border.” Tester, meanwhile, has been featured in ads that feature Republicans who will be voting for Trump and backing Tester. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who is running for retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s seat, also boasts in a recent ad that she “wrote a law signed by President Trump forcing drug companies to show their actual prices.” Trump and Republican Senate candidates have recently gained ground in the polling. In Pennsylvania, Casey’s lead over Dave McCormick has been cut from 5 points at the end of September to just 1.9 points as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the RealClearPolitics average. In Wisconsin, Baldwin leads Republican Eric Hovde by just 1.5 points, and in Ohio, Brown is ahead of Bernie Moreno by less than 1 percentage point per the RCP average.

"60","https://www.dailywire.com/news/jd-vance-dont-trust-the-polls","JD Vance: Don’t Trust The Polls","Trump's VP pick suggests betting markets have been more accurate. Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), the 2024 Republican vice presidential nominee, discouraged people from trusting the polls — even when they favor his cause — and suggested betting markets have been a better gauge. Less than two weeks out from Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris has a slight edge in national polls and a small disadvantage in battleground state polls, while many betting markets show former President Donald Trump and Vance with more than a 10-point advantage. Vance recently sat down for an interview with podcaster Theo Von, who explained his view that people betting money is a “good tracker in a capitalistic society” and pressed the VP candidate on his faith in the polls, noting how they have missed dating back to 2016. “You shouldn’t trust polls, whether they’re good for us or bad for us,” Vance said. “And here’s the reason you shouldn’t trust polls: … About 10 years ago, every 10th person you called to do a poll would answer. Now it’s about 1-in-30 people, okay?” he said. Vance said “another important thing” concerns how Democrats, “especially if you’re a higher-education-level Democrat,” are far more willing to answer pollster questions whereas “if you’re like my family, if somebody called them — a stranger — and said, ‘Who are you going to vote for?,’ they would say, ‘F you,’ and hang up the phone.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Although pollsters weigh their results to try and account for underrepresented groups, Vance emphasized that he believes it is “very hard to get an accurate sample to give you any sense of what is going on” with Harris supporters being more responsive to pollsters than Trump backers. Vance explained that he witnessed how the polls could be off-target during the U.S. Senate race he won in 2022. “There were all these public polls that said … the race was tied or maybe we’d even lose by a few points and the pollster that I had who just polled for my campaign — he’s actually Trump’s pollster, too, and very smart guy — and he said, ‘Look, the reason these polls are wrong is because they’re not reaching voters who don’t like to answer polls and those voters are going heavily for you.’ So I said, ‘Okay, well how much are we going to win by?’ And he said, ‘You’re going to win by 6 points.’ And we won by 7 points, right? So he was much more accurate than the public pollers,” Vance said. Vance posited that public polls that get published in a newspaper article might cost between $10,000 and $20,000, when it would really require between $60,000 and $70,000 to get an accurate sample with “thousands and thousands” of people being called for the survey. Referring to a betting market chart that Von had displayed, one from Kalshi that showed Trump with a 57%-43% lead over Harris in the 2024 presidential election, Vance said, “Honestly, yeah, I think that chart’s about right. I think that we’ve probably got about a 60% chance of winning.” In summing up his view, Vance said “don’t buy” the polls, even if they are showing a win for him and Trump because it might dissuade people from voting and something might happen after which Harris supporters may not want to answer pollster questions. “So you just can’t trust this stuff,” Vance said. “You’ve got to assume that you just got to work your ass off. That’s what we’re trying to do. You know, President Trump and I are doing multiple events a day at this point, and if you want — in my view — if you want to secure the border, have common sense economic policy, then Donald Trump is your man.” Already have an account?

Daily Wire Editor Emeritus Ben Shapiro on Wednesday relayed a personal story about crime in Los Angeles to underscore the reality that such issues are actually what Americans care about, not the latest opposition research dump on former President Donald Trump. Shapiro, who recently spoke at UCLA, said he went out to dinner this week in a nice part of Los Angeles with his wife and another couple. When they left to head home, at around 10:30 p.m., his friends were robbed by three young black males who are still at large. “You want to know why nobody cares about the Left-wing media’s latest oppo dump?” Shapiro explained, both on X and his Wednesday podcast. “The answer is obvious: people care about the quality of their lives. And life is getting worse under Democratic governance.” “Here’s just a quick story,” he continued. “We’re in LA this week. So we decided to go out with some friends, a husband and wife. Nice area of the city, well lit, not too late at night. We finish dinner at around 10:30 and head back to our car. Since my wife and I have 24/7 security, we’re safe. Not so for our friends.” When they got to their car, Shapiro said, “a Hyundai without plates speeds up and stops. Three young black guys jump out of the car (suspect description relevant because they’re still at large!) and rush up to my friend, yank him out of his car, and grab his watch, phone and wallet. They then sprint around the car and grab his wife, start trying to pull off her jewelry. She screams and kicks, and presumably losing time, they take off in top gear down the street.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 The three suspects have still not been identified by LAPD, Shapiro explained, adding that it took about 15 minutes for police to even arrive on the scene. But that is “not their fault,” he said, but due to Left-wing policies and activism. “LA is wildly understaffed, and the LAPD has been treated horribly by the city government, such that officers have been targeted for simply doing their jobs,” Shapiro said. “I know and am friends with many of them.” “My friend and his wife weren’t armed up, either, because it’s nearly impossible to carry a gun in LA legally, and also because if you shoot a criminal in LA, there’s a solid shot YOU end up in jail,” he said. Shapiro said these two friends have been assaulted more than once on the streets of LA, and there have been no arrests and no prosecutions of the suspects. In one instance, the wife was physically assaulted by a homeless man and the husband had a knife drawn on him. “This is why people increasingly don’t give a s*** about the media’s latest horror story about Trump Saying Bad Things™,” Shapiro mocked. Left-wing outlet The Atlantic recently circulated a story about Trump allegedly disparaging a slain soldier. The soldier’s own family, though, say they support Trump and have criticized The Atlantic for politicizing their family member’s death. “The same people who maintain that street crime is no big deal, or a reflection of institutional racism, or that inflation is hunky dory, or that the biggest issue in American life is whether or not Billy has the right to be called Susan…these are not serious people,” Shapiro said. “But people’s lives are serious business. And bad governance means worse lives for people,” he closed. You want to know why nobody cares about the Left-wing media’s latest oppo dump? The answer is obvious: people care about the quality of their lives. And life is getting worse under Democratic governance. Here’s just a quick story. We’re in LA this week.

Bush (1.27 million)” and under former President Barack Obama (195,000) than under Trump, providing the numbers under Eisenhower (1.2 million), Ford (767,000), and Reagan (582,000). The CNN report also pointed out that because Trump only had one term so far, his loss of jobs does not even set a record among those presidents who only served once. During the 2024 campaign, Trump has focused much of his attention on the economy, blasting the Biden-Harris administration’s record on the issue. Voters also list the economy and inflation, which reached 9.1% under President Joe Biden, as the top issues heading into the election. Harris has also focused on addressing Americans’ economic woes during her campaign and has largely blamed corporate greed for a rise in prices.

"64","https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-new-republic-claims-republicans-cheat-to-win-elections-here-are-its-absurd-examples","The New Republic Claims Republicans ‘Cheat’ To Win Elections. Here Are Its Absurd Examples.","Negative campaign tactics amount to cheating by the GOP, but not Democrats, the article insists An article published this week in the leftist New Republic claims Republicans regularly cheat to win elections. But the article’s examples of alleged “cheating” aren’t evidence at all —and the only real example of cheating the article provides involves a Democrat. On October 21, New Republic editor Michael Tomasky published “Republicans Are Cheating. Again. But Now It’s Worse Than Ever.” Tomasky, a longtime left-wing columnist, claims that “the factual record” shows Republicans “cheat” to win elections, and have done so in “most elections in recent American history.” Tomasky then promises to substantiate this claim with evidence. What follows is a series of absurd examples. He begins by pointing to a text message allegedly sent to young voters in Wisconsin, warning them that it’s illegal to vote in a state where you’re not eligible to vote. CNN first reported that story, and it is unknown how many people actually got the text message. A left-wing voting group is demanding an investigation, and the New Republic deems this cheating by the GOP, even though the text is clearly trying to prevent cheating. The New Republic and CNN insist the text is meant to scare young voters into not voting, a grim assessment of the intelligence of young voters. Tomasky then starts playing the hits, repeating the frequently-debunked claim that Russia is trying to skew the election in favor of former President Donald Trump. Earlier claims about Russian disinformation have been proven false, including the 2016 Russia collusion hoax and the claim that the Hunter Biden laptop was a Russian disinformation operation. But the article downplays Iran’s efforts to tip the election in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris, even though an Iranian spy ring infiltrated the Biden administration and someone with a high-level security clearance leaked Israel war plan documents to Iran. Nevertheless, The New Republic insists “Iranian meddling is a molehill compared to the vast mountain range of Russian meddling.” The article also knocks Elon Musk for handing out checks to voters who sign a petition, though they admit it doesn’t “appear to be illegal.” Tomasky then gets into the alleged historical examples of Republicans cheating, beginning with the year the author was born: 1960. Of course, that year John F. Kennedy won the presidency, and Tomasky has to admit that “there was probably some Democratic cheating going on in Cook County, but it didn’t matter” because JFK would have won anyway. Just a few lines later, it says that Watergate was still the bad kind of cheating, even though Nixon would have won “in a huge landslide” regardless. Speaking of Nixon, Tomasky notes that his campaign cheated when it signaled to Vietnam it would get a better deal if he beat Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. Johnson called it “treason,” but former President Barack Obama must have thought it was a good idea, since he told then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2012 that he would have “more flexibility” after the election. Tomasky doesn’t mention John Kerry speaking to a former Iranian Foreign Minister during the Trump administration to undermine Trump’s Iran policy, so he must not have thought that was “cheating,” either. Tomasky accuses former President Ronald Reagan of cheating in 1980. His evidence? A Democrat-turned-Republican who hoped for a cabinet position allegedly told Iran not to release the hostages until after the election, because Reagan would win and give them a better deal. The examples only get weaker as Tomasky gets closer to the present. George H. W. Bush’s “Willie Horton” ad amounts to cheating, even if it wasn’t “consequential outright cheating.” Bush’s son obviously cheated in 2000, Tomasky says, even though it was former Vice President Al Gore who refused to accept defeat and set the table for the Supreme Court to rule that Bush won the election. And while Tomasky smears Republicans for “the swift-boating of John Kerry” in 2004, he makes no mention of the outrageous smear campaigns mounted against Mitt Romney in 2012, including allegations that he gave a woman cancer and would put black people “back in chains” — the latter of which was, of course, made by then-Vice President Joe Biden. After 2004, Tomasky abandons citations altogether, simply stating as fact that Obama won without cheating, Trump cheated, and Biden didn’t. He conveniently leaves out the changes to mail-in voting made in 2020 and Democrats literally switching out Biden for Harris after Biden’s poll numbers dropped. Already have an account?

Former President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Defense is “probably” responsible for leaking Israel’s military plans for an alleged attack on Iran. Last week, top-secret documents were posted on pro-Iranian social media accounts that reportedly showed U.S. intel on Israeli military movements in preparation for a retaliatory attack on Iran. U.S. officials said they are concerned about what appeared to be a “very serious security breach within the U.S. intelligence community,” Axios reported. On Tuesday morning, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the leak “Probably came from [the] Defense Department” and “seriously damaged and compromised” Israel. “U.S. leaked highly confidential Documents from Israel. May have come from Defense Department,” Trump wrote. “Israel has been seriously damaged and compromised by this. Wartime strategy and data. Probably came from Defense Department. MUST FIND THE LEAKER! Israel no longer wants to share documents with U.S., and who can blame them!” The U.S. intelligence leak reportedly included two top-secret documents, which appeared to be from the National Security Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The White House said on Monday that no other sensitive documents were compromised, CNN reported. The FBI is leading an investigation into the leak, seeking to determine who had access to the documents. “We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there will be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Monday. Last Friday, a Telegram channel called “Middle East Spectator” claimed it had received the documents from a source within the U.S. intelligence community, according to Axios. The Department of Defense and Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not dispute the authenticity of the documents. The intelligence documents, allegedly produced from U.S. satellite observations, showed the Israeli Air Force (IAF) moving planes and preparing munitions. The IAF also reportedly conducted “a large exercise” last week as it prepared for a potential strike on Iran after Iran’s massive rocket attack on Israel earlier this month. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that the intelligence leak is “very concerning,” adding that he spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday “to encourage him.” “He’s done an extraordinary job, I think, prosecuting that war,” Johnson said. “And if he had taken Joe Biden’s advice, they’d be in a much weaker position right now.” Speaker Johnson slams leak of US intel on Israel’s plans to strike Iran: ‘Very concerning’ pic.twitter.com/Qk11xlVQPY — New York Post (@nypost) October 20, 2024 Already have an account?

"66","https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-serves-fries-while-kamala-serves-lies","Trump Serves Fries While Kamala Serves Lies","The Kamala Harris campaign, along with the press, are currently having a full-on meltdown over Trump's visit to McDonald's If Donald Trump wins the presidential election in November — which at this point seems more likely than not — then what happened yesterday at a McDonald’s in Bucks County, Pennsylvania will encapsulate why. Assuming there’s a single honest history book in 20 years, this will be the moment that the authors use to illustrate the trajectory of the race in its final days. On paper, it was basically just a classic photo-op. It’s the kind of thing that’s been done thousands of times before. Donald Trump showed up at the McDonald’s, mingled with the employees, learned how to cook fries, served some customers in the drive-thru, talked to reporters, and left. It doesn’t sound remarkable. It certainly doesn’t sound like the kind of thing that Trump’s opponent should treat like a crisis, or anything approaching a crisis. So it’s notable that the Kamala Harris campaign, along with the press, are currently having a full-on meltdown over Trump’s visit to McDonald’s yesterday. And if you want to know why Donald Trump is probably going to win in November, you have to understand exactly why this is happening. You have to understand why they’re so threatened by the fact that Trump served fries for 15 minutes. To give you some idea what I’m talking about, here’s the reaction from MSNBC, where they foamed at the mouth while simultaneously accusing Donald Trump of being crazy. Watch: 🚨 MSNBC having a complete meltdown over Trump visiting a McDonald’s LOL!!! 😂 💀 pic.twitter.com/SsAsrF6lKX — Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) October 20, 2024 MSNBC claims they have no idea why Donald Trump went to McDonald’s. Maybe he likes Big Macs, they suggest. But probably, he’s losing his mind. Of course, they know exactly why Donald Trump was there. On the stump, Kamala Harris has repeatedly claimed that she worked at McDonald’s in the 1980s. But the company says it has no record of her employment. And Kamala Harris has been unwilling to provide any evidence herself. Additionally, the Washington Free Beacon found that neither of Harris’ memoirs makes any mention of a job at McDonald’s. The first time she publicly mentioned the job was decades after-the-fact, at a political rally in 2019. And then there’s this: The Free Beacon also obtained a copy of Harris’s October 1987 job application for a law clerk position in the Alameda County district attorney’s office. On that form, Harris, who was in law school at the time, listed several jobs—including a month-long clerical job at a stock brokerage—in a section that asked her to list every position she held in the last 10 years. McDonald’s is absent. On top of that, when she speaks about the job, Kamala Harris acts a bit like she does when she talks about the Glock she supposedly owns. Her speech is halting. Her descriptions are vague. She just says she handled the fries. And Kamala’s handlers have changed their minds on why she had the job, too. At one point, they said it was to pay for college. At another, they said she worked at McDonald’s to get some extra spending money. It all seems fake because it is fake. On one level, it’s obviously very alarming that Democrats have nominated a candidate who’s so fake that she would lie about something like this. This is the first case of stolen McValor that we’ve ever seen in politics. And even worse: she didn’t even lie convincingly about it. At the same time, there’s no denying that this is maybe the easiest target for mockery that you can possibly imagine. If “SNL” were still funny, they’d be doing nonstop skits on this. But SNL isn’t funny anymore, so that job has fallen to Donald Trump. And so he showed up to the McDonald’s kitchen in Bucks County yesterday, worked for about 15 minutes, and declared that he’s now worked at McDonald’s more than Kamala Harris. This is an image that’s going to find its way into a lot of retrospectives on the 2024 presidential race. Watch: Donald Trump: ""I have now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala at McDonalds” she is mad 😂 I LOVE THIS 👏 Kamala could never pic.twitter.com/hsdIQYvA5m — Marjorie Taylor Greene Press Release (Parody) (@MTGrepp) October 20, 2024 There’s a lot to discuss in that short clip. But one thing to notice is that Trump isn’t really even being hostile here. He’s not coming across as completely unhinged and unpleasant, like that MSNBC panel. In fact, at one point, Trump told reporters in the drive-thru lane that he wished Kamala Harris a happy birthday. He offered to send her fries and even flowers to mark the occasion. This is some light-hearted mockery that happens to be extremely damaging for Kamala Harris, from a political perspective. But a big part of the reason why it’s so damaging is that no one in the corporate press — or the Kamala Harris campaign — is capable of enduring mockery at their own expense. Instead, by going into hysterics over it, they’re revealing that the Trump campaign is right. They’re highlighting the exact vulnerability that the Trump campaign wanted to highlight, which is that everything about Kamala Harris’ image is artificial and inflexible. There’s nothing genuine about her, or her fake life story. And yesterday, in maybe the most effective way imaginable, Donald Trump made that fact impossible to ignore. That’s why, one-by-one, every single mainstream outlet has published an article attacking Trump for the crime of cooking a batch of fries. They went into a fully defensive posture. And they all use pretty much the same language. They all say that Trump is out of line for daring to suggest that maybe, Kamala Harris didn’t actually work at McDonald’s. CNN, for example, reports: Trump … has grown fixated on Harris’ employment [at McDonald’s]. In interviews and on the campaign trail, he regularly accuses Harris – without evidence – of making up the factoid. The AP, meanwhile, reports: The visit came as [Trump has] tried to counter Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ accounts on the campaign of working at the fast-food chain while in college, an experience that Trump has claimed — without offering evidence — never happened. And here’s the L.A. Times: Trump visits McDonald’s after he claimed with no evidence Harris didn’t work there during college. One more. This is NBC News: Without evidence, Trump has accused Harris of lying about the experience as a way to improve her working-class credibility. Getting the picture yet? The entirety of the corporate press, without exception, wants you to know that there’s “no evidence” that Kamala Harris didn’t work at McDonald’s. In other words, Donald Trump hasn’t proven a negative. He hasn’t provided a detailed, point-by-point explanation of exactly what Kamala Harris was doing at every moment during the 1980s. Therefore, he has no right to question her narrative. This is completely backwards, obviously. Kamala Harris is the person who claimed that she worked at McDonald’s. She made that claim without providing any evidence. And as I outlined earlier, there is indeed affirmative evidence that she’s lying. It’s circumstantial evidence, and it’s not necessarily conclusive, but it’s still evidence. Right now there’s far more evidence that she didn’t work there, than there is evidence that she did work there. But these media outlets don’t say, “Kamala Harris says — without evidence — that she worked at McDonald’s.” Instead, they take her claim as gospel. And they get all huffy when Donald Trump calls her out on it. And they do it in an extremely coordinated fashion, that makes it clear all of these outlets are reading from the same script. And that script, as we all know, comes from Kamala’s campaign. And as you’d expect, the campaign itself is also melting down over Trump’s visit to McDonald’s. Kamala Harris’ rapid-response director, James Singer, wrote: “Trump doesn’t care about workers, he cares about himself.” Here’s the clip he embedded in the tweet, to support his point: Trump. Asked multiple times if minimum wage should be raised refused to support it. Trump doesn’t care about workers he cares about himself. pic.twitter.com/rAUGqs3dqa — James Singer (@Jemsinger) October 20, 2024 That’s the clip that’s supposed to convince us that Trump is a bad guy because he wouldn’t immediately say, “Yes, raise the minimum wage.” First of all, the fact that Trump — at 78-years-old — was able to learn the ins-and-outs of cooking fries at McDonalds in about 15 minutes isn’t exactly a strong argument for raising the minimum wage. If anything, it’s an argument for lowering it. Of course there are plenty of other problems with the whole line of argument. When the state of California raised its minimum wage, thousands of fast-food workers lost their jobs, and the price of fast-food became more expensive, across the board. That just happened within the last year. This is a “pro-worker” policy, according to the rapid-response director of the Kamala Harris campaign. But that’s not even the worst part of this. The worst part of this is that Kamala Harris’ campaign is making snippy, dumb political arguments in response to a campaign event that was objectively hilarious and effective. They did the same thing after the Al Smith dinner. And it looks terrible every time they do it. Everyone can see in these clips from McDonald’s that the workers loved that Trump was there. He joked around with everyone from the owner of the franchise to the rank-and-file employees. And they were all enjoying it. It’s just not possible to spin this kind of footage to create the narrative they want to create. Watch: So Trump praises the fry cook for his lessons. He asks the woman how long she’s worked there, and when she says 10 years, he congratulates her. He jokes around with the woman about the apron and his favorite part of McDonald’s. The employees think it’s great. And the response from Kamala Harris’ campaign is that Trump was demonstrating that he doesn’t care about fast-food workers. They’re swooping in to remind these McDonald’s workers that they’re wrong, and that Trump actually hates them. It’s not surprising that, on social media, the reaction to this post from Kamala’s rapid-response guy, James Singer, was universally negative. It’s like these people exist on a different planet. The reason the trip was successful is that, again and again, Trump expressed interest in everyday people, and those people returned the favor. And this isn’t something you can coach. It either comes naturally or it doesn’t. Instead of reading from a rehearsed script, which is all Kamala Harris can do, Trump engaged with these employees and customers like human beings. At one point, when a customer in the drive-thru thanked Trump for talking to “ordinary” people, Trump rejected the idea that the guy was “ordinary.” Watch this exchange: Well said by Trump here … We are all “ordinary” and yet none of us is “ordinary” pic.twitter.com/rRHRtML4H7 — Gray Connolly (@GrayConnolly) October 20, 2024 As these videos were shared all over social media, Kamala Harris’ campaign continued to melt down. It was excruciating to watch. The “Kamala’s Win’s” X account — which is run by someone who works in the Biden administration — posted: BREAKING: The McDonald’s location Trump ‘worked’ at was cited earlier this year for health code violations. Disgusting. So they’re attacking the McDonald’s now. Apparently that’s the winning strategy. Team Kamala is going to show how much they care about restaurant workers by calling them disgusting. Meanwhile, Ron Filipkowski, who works for something called “Meidas Touch,” discovered that the McDonald’s wasn’t in fact open to the public at the time of Trump’s visit. He sleuthed that one out: So the place wasn’t even open. It was all staged and fake. He didn’t work for real at a McDonalds. It was a staged fraud just like every other event. I have to admit, I was shocked by this revelation. I figured that Donald Trump showed up to McDonald’s unannounced, applied for a job, interviewed with the shift manager, was hired, filled out all of the necessary paperwork, went through training, worked a whole shift and would be back to work the morning rush the next day. But it turns out that Trump isn’t actually a McDonald’s employee. This is a major scoop by Ron. For their part, the New York Post published an article entitled: EXCLUSIVE: I’m an ex-McDonald’s chef — Trump has no idea how difficult it is to be a french fry cook. The article contains quotes like this: “Being a McDonald’s employee is more difficult than a lot of people imagine. … Maintaining a cool temperament is key. .. As a fry cook, anything can go wrong, which is tough because almost every McDonald’s order includes fries.” It goes on and on. I know this comes as a shock to our friends on the Left, but it is possible to show that you respect and value someone without being insanely patronizing. I have nothing against McDonald’s employees. But, no, it is not difficult to put a batch of frozen French fries into a vat of grease. It is not difficult to work fast food. As a general rule, if a 16-year-old can do a job and do it well, that means, by definition, it’s not difficult. Unless that 16-year-old is a world champion gymnast or something. But when it comes to normal jobs that pay you an hourly wage, the ones that predominantly hire high school kids are not difficult. But all of this nonsense, and the impotent rage from the Left, tells us two things. First of all, as I mentioned, they know that Kamala Harris is a fraud, and they resent anyone who exposes that. But also, this stunt demonstrates, once again, that Donald Trump is the master at hijacking the news cycle. He’s also extremely good at retail politics, in part because he’s been in public life for so long, in so many different contexts. And here, he’s doing both at once. This is a unique talent, especially in this presidential race. The reason that Kamala Harris couldn’t pull off this McDonald’s stunt is the same reason she had to skip the Al Smith dinner. She has none of Trump’s redeeming qualities. Donald Trump, by contrast, knows how to be a real person and have fun. If Kamala tried the same stunt it would come off painfully fake and awkward. The key is that Trump doesn’t pretend to be a working class guy with lots of experience doing jobs like this. He knows he’s a fish out of water and that’s the fun of it. Voters pick up on the authenticity and respect it. That’s why thousands of people were gathered outside the McDonald’s. It’s why every interaction Trump had inside the McDonald’s was friendly, entertaining and upbeat. It’s why the scene looked like this, the whole time: Today the Kamala Harris campaign is still asking how this happened. They’re asking how a photo-op like this could immediately garner tens of millions of views on every social media platform. They’re asking why more than 7,000 people gathered outside the McDonald’s to see this. They’re asking why everyone’s saying that the images from this McDonald’s look like a Norman Rockwell painting, and how they’ll end up in the history books. The reason the Kamala campaign can’t answer those questions is the same reason they’re likely about to lose this election. This race is between perhaps the most authentic presidential candidate in modern America history and the most inauthentic. And if the desperate, furious reaction from Kamala Harris’ campaign and the corporate press yesterday tells us anything, it’s that they’re now painfully aware which candidate is which.

"67","https://www.dailywire.com/news/trumps-cruising-kamalas-crashing","Trump’s Cruising, Kamala’s Crashing","It appears that Donald Trump has regained momentum not only in the swing states, but also in the battleground states. We are two weeks out from the election and Donald Trump currently has all the momentum. Not some of the momentum— all the momentum. This has been a wild race because the momentum shifts have been insane. When Joe Biden was in the race, Trump had all the momentum. Then Joe Biden dropped out of the race and Kamala Harris was put into the middle of the race and suddenly there was “joy” and “wonder” and all the momentum shifted over to the Democrats. And then the air slowly came out of the balloon. It appears that Donald Trump has regained momentum not only in the swing states, but also in the battleground states. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average, Trump leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia. All he needs to do to win the election is win Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia and either Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, and he is leading in the last three, according to Real Clear Politics. He also happens to be leading in Nevada. So if the election were held today — no tossups — he could win 312 electoral votes. Trump is going to win the election. In order for Kamala Harris to win this election, she probably needs to be up at least two and a half to three points in the popular vote. She does not appear to have those numbers behind her right now, unless the polls are very, very wrong. What’s more, her campaign is flagging. She’s totally disconnected from the American people. In fact, she is attempting to reach out to the Liz Cheney voter. There aren’t that many of those folks, the disaffected Republicans who love Liz Cheney and now are going to move on over from Donald Trump to Kamala Harris. Those people are incredibly rare. That number is vanishingly small. But according to The Wall Street Journal: Harris is expected to hold events on Monday with Cheney in suburbs in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. She’s also hosting separate get-out-the-vote rallies later in the week with former President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama in Georgia and Michigan, swing states where Harris needs to run up large margins in the urban centers and suburbs. So she’s now relying on a halo effect from the Obamas to bring out the black vote in Georgia and Michigan. How much is she flailing? She’s flailing so much that the Washington Post editorial board put out a piece saying that she should commit to having a big 250th birthday celebration for the country in 2026, to recapture the feeling of patriotism by pledging that in July of 2026, she would throw a giant party for the American semiquincentennial. If this is what’s left in her bag, she’s got nothing. Over the weekend, it was Kamala Harris’s birthday. Kamala Harris decided she was going to celebrate it with Stevie Wonder. She went to a historically black church and she did some sort of birthday routine with Stevie Wonder. Meanwhile, Trump was at the Steelers-Jets game, getting standing ovations and having people run around the field with pro-Trump signs. And that wasn’t the best thing that Trump did all weekend. The Left lost their mind because Donald Trump did something unthinkable. He went to a McDonald’s and worked the fry station and the drive-thru window. That was old school politicking in the United States. It was charming. It was funny. It is meant to highlight the disconnect between what Kamala Harris says she is and what she is. You’ll recall that she has now claimed multiple times that she worked at McDonald’s while she was a college student. And there are some fairly serious questions about whether that’s true or not. She has yet to name which McDonald’s she actually worked at. There are no records of her having worked at McDonald’s so far as anyone is aware. It’s not really a big deal, except that it undermines any claim of authenticity that she has, because she is completely ersatz. She is the vinyl of actual human beings. She is not made of anything organic as a candidate. So Trump went to a McDonald’s, worked the drive-thru window, and looked perfectly authentic there. I don’t care whether you like Donald Trump or you hate Donald Trump. He is excellent at this. It’s a special quality that some politicians have; he is amazingly good one-on-one with people. Trump speaks to people as though they are family. Donald Trump enjoys other human beings. Kamala Harris doesn’t look like she’s ever met a human. I’m not sure a lot of other politicians would be able to get away with what Trump did, except that he eats McDonald’s all the time. When he was president of the United States, he had a giant meal sponsored at the White House in the giant reception room that was filled with fast food from places like McDonald’s. And at McDonald’s, he looked like he was having a good time, which is a good indication that he is winning, because you can often tell a winning campaign from a losing campaign by who’s having a better time on the campaign trail. Losing campaigns are relentless and grueling and annoying, and the candidate seems weathered and doesn’t want to be there. And that’s how it feels with Kamala Harris. Trump is in a very good mood. He’s definitely enjoying this campaign. Kamala Harris is definitely not enjoying this campaign. And that should tell you something.

Deroy Murdock warned on Monday that if current polls are any indication, the Democrats could be in real trouble with black voters come Election Day. Murdock cited a recent New York Times/Siena poll that showed Trump polling over 20% with black voters — outstripping his numbers from both 2020 and 2016 — and showing a real weakness in Democrat support as the 2024 election reached its final days.

Black voters constitute such a big part of the Democratic base, you take that out, the whole thing sort of falls over,” Murdock said. “And this is the result of a very simple question that President Trump has asked black voters since 2016: ‘What the hell do you have to lose?'” “They’ve responded to that question thinking, well, we keep voting Democrat and things don’t seem to get better,” Murdock continued, noting that Trump had gone from 8% of the black vote in 2016 to 12% in 2020 and appeared to be nearing 24% going into the last two weeks of the 2024 election cycle. “If that sticks at Election Day, the Democrats are going to be in very big trouble.” The writing has been on the wall for weeks, with even CNN pollster Harry Enten sounding the alarm last week as Harris has continued to hemorrhage support from black men in particular. WATCH: No matter how you splice the data, Trump seems to be the strongest Republican with Black voters since 1960. Young Black men in particular have trended right during Trump's runs (cutting the Dem margin by 40 pts from 2012). But Trump's doing historically well with Black women too pic.twitter.com/FyUqqDKLjE — (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) October 14, 2024 Enten outlined the shift to the right — particularly among black men — noting that Harris was seeing the lowest levels of support for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1960. Things got so bad that Harris brought in former President Barack Obama to tip the scales, and his solution was to scold black men for not offering their blind support to the Democratic nominee, despite the fact that the party leadership had dropped her on them rather than allowing the people to vote on her. CNN Republican pundit Scott Jennings weighed in on that scenario, arguing that simply yelling at black men wasn’t likely to convince many of them to throw their support behind Harris. “Obama, specifically, when he was having trouble with rural voters in Pennsylvania, go back all the way into his campaigns, he insulted them about their culture and values,” Jennings said at the time. “I don’t think it’s helpful to insult a group of people who are already not enthusiastic about your campaign, but I think that’s what he did today.” Already have an account?

If you can't see that, you're totally blind,' Uygur wrote. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, Sirius XM host Megyn Kelly and more have destroyed the left’s pearl-clutching over former President Donald Trump’s stop at McDonald’s in Pennsylvania where he worked the drive-thru and as a fry cooker for 15 minutes on Sunday. Media outlets like Rolling Stone magazine, Newsweek, and CNN have slammed Trump for what they’ve called a “bizarre” photo-op and a “staged” event for his 15 minutes of work at McDonald’s, where he drew attention to the claim by Vice President Kamala Harris that she worked there in college, though the campaign has yet to provide proof. Portnoy took to social media and sarcastically wrote on X that, “Woodward and Bernstein who? Looks like @Newsweek just wrapped up the Pulitzer for investigative journalism. Next up. Rumors Santa may not be real….” The host of “The Megyn Kelly Show” podcast agreed, and reposted a screenshot of one person’s response to the Newsweek headline calling it “perfect.” The person wrote sarcastically “Wait he wasn’t actually hired as the new fry guy?” The host of “Young Turks” Cenk Uygur posted on social media and wrote, “Some in the press called Trump’s McDonald’s photo-op bizarre. This is how you lose credibility.” “That was a home run photo-op,” he added.”He looked like a real person there, connecting with the average American.

Trump applied for the position online two weeks ago. He got the job and showed up to work his shift. The hours aren’t flexible enough to allow him to run for president though, so my sources tell me he’ll be transitioning into a part time cashier role at Kroger.” Another person wrote that Newsweek should “dust off the mantle, the Pulitzer Prize is on the way.” And “Mark my words, once the press takes down Trump in the McWatergate scandal, enrollment in journalism schools will quadruple.” Newsweek later doubled down on its Trump-McD’s piece with a second one about how the McDonald’s where Trump appeared had “failed its last health inspection.” “An inspection report for the McDonald’s restaurant in Pennsylvania cited employees not having ‘hands clean and properly washed,'” the X post read. Daily Wire Editor Emeritus and host Ben Shapiro reacted to the headlines and wrote that the reason Leftists are “losing their minds over Trump’s McDonald’s campaign appearance” is “because it demonstrates that he likes and cares about regular Americans.

Former President Donald Trump visited Monday parts of western North Carolina ravaged by Hurricane Helene, praising the community response to the devastating storm. During a stop in Swannanoa, Trump thanked first responders and promised to help rebuild the region after widespread flooding and mudslides caused by Helene. The storm’s death toll has surpassed 230 across the Southeast, including nearly 100 people in North Carolina alone. “What happened to this neighborhood, and the communities all across North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Virginia, Tennessee, was an act of absolute devastation,” Trump said. “All of America shares your sorrow and your grief over the past few weeks. This region has seen an extraordinary hardship. But in the midst of such terrible tragedy, we have also seen the extraordinary love that binds us together as Americans.” Trump thanked the community for banding together after the storm, saying that “nothing is more inspiring than to see the American spirit triumph over adversity with the most selfless acts of generosity and love.” During his remarks, Trump talked about 51-year-old firefighter Tony Ray Garrison of Fairview, North Carolina, who was killed by a mudslide alongside his nephew as they attempted to help storm victims. “In the wake of this horrible storm, many Americans in this region felt helpless, and abandoned, and left behind by their government. And yet, in North Carolina’s hour of desperation, the American people answered the call, much more so than your federal government, unfortunately,” Trump said. Trump also brought up Adam Smith, a former Army Green Beret, who has used his helicopter to help rescue those in western North Carolina who were trapped after Helene came through. Smith thanked Trump for coming and visiting, saying it would help people not to forget about the region. “To have you here, to have an opportunity to have this conversation on a national level, will keep western North Carolina on the map, and not leave the communities holding the bag on the back end of this,” Smith said. Brian Burpeau, the owner of Swannanoa automotive shop, Diamondback 4×4, said his entire shop was flooded. “We’ve lost bridges, we’ve lost businesses, we lost homes, we’ve lost people,” he said. “The devastation here is just not anything I would have ever imagined.” Trump was accompanied at the event by Senator Ted Budd, who said it would take years to rebuild the region after Helene. The former president has raised around $8 million for those impacted by the storm, of which $7 million has already been distributed. Already have an account?

A well-known statistician, Nate Silver, shared on Sunday two dozen reasons why he believes former President Donald Trump could defeat Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. In a post to his online newsletter, the “Silver Bulletin,” Silver explained how he wanted to provide a “laundry list” of factors that favor Trump to counter the notion that this year’s White House race is Harris’ to lose. The list was published less than three weeks out from Election Day as betting markets, polls, and Silver Bulletin’s own forecast show Trump gaining momentum and leading Harris in key battleground states. Silver said Harris is favored to win the popular vote, but he stressed Republicans are favored by a 2-point Electoral College “bias” that is “inherently difficult for Democrats to overcome” in close elections. Other reasons focused on the economy, including high inflation, voter “perceptions” that lag “objective data,” and “nostalgia” for the “relatively strong” economy under Trump before the COVID pandemic hit. Silver noted that incumbent parties are doing “very poorly” worldwide, populism is “often a highly effective strategy,” and illegal immigration “increased substantially” in recent years as backlash to it grew. He said Harris lacks a “viable strategy” for explaining her changing stances and has to contend with a late start to her run as well as taking in some of the staff from President Joe Biden’s “poorly-run” campaign. Taking a look at a broader scale in the U.S., Silver declared that “cultural vibes are shifting to the right” while the Left “continues to pay a price for the excesses of 2020 on COVID, crime, ‘wokeness,’ and other issues.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 More of Silver’s reasons included Democrats losing support among black voters and other minority groups as well as “many men, especially younger men,” feeling “lost” amid a number of societal shifts. Silver said voter “objections” related to Biden’s advanced age before he dropped out of the 2024 race ultimately “neuters what should have been one of Harris’s best issues about Trump’s age and cognitive fitness.” Harris, seeking to become the first woman president, was also mentioned as a reason why Trump might win, as Silver explained that in the 2016 election, “undecideds broke heavily against Hillary Clinton, and she underperformed her polls.” Silver listed low trust in the media, Trump’s effectiveness at “convincing voters that he’s on their side even if his election would not be in their best interest,” and the Democrats focusing so much on January 6. There is also the Democrats’ “college-educated consultant class” having “poor instincts” for appealing to the mass public while Trump has “done more to cultivate support among ‘weird’ marginal voting groups.” Further reasons included how the world has become “more unstable” under Biden, the Israel-Hamas war fracturing the Democratic base, and Harris running on “vibes” while struggling to “articulate” her vision. Silver also listed more Left-leaning third-party candidates than Right-leaning ones, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsing Trump, Elon Musk backing Trump, and Trump surviving two assassination attempts.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign boasted a nearly $222 million haul in September, more than three times the money raised by former President Donald Trump’s campaign last month. FEC filings posted on Sunday night showed Harris’ campaign raising $221.8 million in September to the Trump campaign’s $63 million, The Hill reported. The Harris campaign, combined with the Democratic National Committee and the state parties, raised nearly $360 million in September. The Republican National Committee and other Republican-affiliated groups combined with the Trump campaign raised $160 million over the same period, according to the Associated Press. A large percentage of Harris’ September haul — about $82 million — came from glitzy fundraisers her campaign held with celebrities and politicians in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City. The fundraising numbers for the Harris campaign set a new record for the biggest fundraising quarter, as it received $1 billion in the three-month period that ended on September 30. Some of that money, however, was part of President Joe Biden’s war chest before Harris became the de facto nominee in July and inherited tens of millions of dollars from the Biden campaign. The Harris campaign spent more than it took in last month, pouring $270 million into advertisements on TV, radio, billboards, and the internet, the AP reported. In September, the Trump campaign spent around $53 million on media, according to The New York Times. Harris and the groups supporting her said they entered October with $348 million on hand, while Trump and his supporting groups entered the new month with $283 million. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 While the Trump campaign lags far behind Harris and the Democrats’ fundraising, the Republican nominee is benefitting from a campaign push by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and his pro-Trump America PAC. The billionaire appeared with Trump in the former president’s return to Butler, Pennsylvania, earlier this month and has held his own town hall events in support of Trump and Republicans. Musk’s America PAC is offering $47 a day to anyone who refers a registered swing state voter to sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments, and the billionaire announced during a town hall in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday that he will give away $1 million “randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election.” Already have an account?

"73","https://www.dailywire.com/news/house-finds-secret-service-responsible-for-preventable-trump-assassination-attempt","House Finds Secret Service Responsible For ‘Preventable’ Trump Assassination Attempt","The House task force investigating the July 13 attack released an interim report on Monday. House lawmakers tasked with investigating the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania said Monday that the attack never would have happened had the Secret Service been prepared. The House Task Force on the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler released a 53-page interim report detailing the “stunning security failures” that led to Trump being struck in the ear by a bullet fired by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. These failures included numerous communication errors and inadequate planning to secure the site. “Put simply, the evidence obtained by the Task Force to date shows the tragic and shocking events of July 13 were preventable and should not have happened,” the task force said. One of the key findings of the report concluded that the security perimeter set up by the Secret Service allowed people to get within around 150 yards of the stage where Trump was speaking without going through security screening. “The Task Force found that the [American Glass Research] parking lot was in fact closed to vehicle traffic, but a crowd gathered on the adjacent grassy area near the chain link fence that marked the outer perimeter established by the Secret Service,” the report said. “Onlookers in that area did not need to pass through the event’s magnetometers to see the rally stage — despite being approximately 150 yards from where the former President was speaking.” Additionally, the task force noted that the Secret Service recognized that areas outside the security perimeter were risks but didn’t take the proper steps to secure them. “Despite its proximity to a main road, clear sight lines to the stage, and elevated position, the Secret Service placed the AGR complex outside the secure perimeter for the event, meaning that the crowd that gathered there was not screened by USSS or other law enforcement,” the report said. “The consequences of that decision were compounded by the fact that state and local law enforcement posted near the complex did not have complete visual coverage of the area.” Crooks was able to access the roof of the AGR building using an air conditioning unit to hoist himself up. From there, he opened fire, injuring Trump and two rallygoers and killing 50-year-old Corey Comperatore. One local Butler police officer encountered Crooks before he opened fire as he attempted to climb up on the roof. “I see Crooks facing downrange towards the stage, but his eyes are back at me as I’m coming up,” the officer told the task force. “And I would say, like, his facial expressions was surprised. His eyes were very big, like, what are you doing up here?” “And as I’m coming up and he’s got the gun pointed at me, I don’t know if I reach for my gun, if I slip, but all I know from that point is I’m looking at him, and all my weight is on my, like, arms, my hands, and I don’t have a grip,” the officer added, explaining why he was unable to confront Crooks. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 The officer fell to the ground and radioed out that there was a man with a gun on the roof. The task force said it has no evidence that this warning reached Trump’s Secret Service detail before Crooks opened fire. While the FBI has said that a Secret Service sniper took out Crooks, one local police officer said he fired at Crooks and believed that he hit him. FBI investigator Kevin Rojek said that the agency had “no forensic evidence indicating that that round either struck our subject or the subject’s rifle.” The release of the House report follows several other reports on the assassination attempt from the Senate and from an independent panel created by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Each report has found the Secret Service liable for major planning failures and systematic communication breakdowns. Already have an account?

It's something that law enforcement could take a look at."" For those who don’t spend their Sunday mornings glued to the television — and their Sunday afternoons attempting to dig through a week’s worth of network and cable news media spin — The Daily Wire has compiled a short summary of what you may have missed. With just over two weeks to go before the election on November 5, the media talking heads are pulling out all of the stops. Based on what was said across the Sunday morning political talk shows, the two prevailing narratives are simple: there’s something wrong with former President Donald Trump, and entrepreneur Elon Musk is undermining democracy by supporting free speech. On ABC’s “This Week,” the guests were all about Trump — and after running cover for an obviously-declining President Joe Biden, they suddenly seemed overly concerned about the former president’s age and mental state. National Review’s Ramesh Ponnuru claimed that Trump’s speeches had showcased him wandering off topic more often than in the past. “Trump is declining. He is exhibiting less control. He’s always been meandering, but it’s gone to a new level. He’s always had a streak of vulgarity, it’s gone to a new level as well,” he said, arguing that Trump was a “different person” based on a comparison of clips of Trump from the current campaign cycle and from 2016 or even the 1980s. “You see a decline there and it is I think related to age.” “Trump is declining. He is exhibiting less control. He's always been meandering, but it's gone to a new level … You see a decline there and it is I think related to age,” National Review's @RameshPonnuru tells @MarthaRaddatz. https://t.co/6fHsjUTzJ8 pic.twitter.com/qnB9cLUZDE — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 20, 2024 The New Yorker’s Susan Glasser offered a similar analysis, saying that a “noticeable decline” was obvious and that Trump was showing a “lack of discipline.” “There was a metric that he speaking twice as long at his rallies as he used to, even in his previous campaigns.” There is a “noticeable decline” in former Pres.

Donald Trump is out there saying it. It is unstable,” Tapper complained. “But you continue to,” Johnson noted. “Because you won’t address it!” Tapper protested. TAPPER: ""I don't want to be talking about this. Donald Trump is out there saying it.

Governor Josh Shapiro (D-PA) spoke with “Meet the Press” anchor Kristen Welker about Musk — and he went so far as to say that Musk should be investigated. Welker set Shapiro up for his response, asking, “You are a former attorney general. Is this legal?” Shapiro responded by suggesting that Musk’s political action committee was a “dark money” entity and argued that it should certainly be scrutinized. “That is deeply concerning,” he said. “Look, Musk has a right to be able to express his views. He’s made it very very clear that he supports Donald Trump. I don’t — obviously we have a difference of opinion. I don’t deny him that right. But when you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions that folks may want to take a look at … It’s something that law enforcement could take a look at.” WATCH: Every day until Election Day, Elon Musk says he’ll give $1M to a voter who has signed his super PAC’s petition “in favor of free speech and the right to bear arms.”@JoshShapiroPA: “That is deeply concerning. … It's something that law enforcement could take a look at."" pic.twitter.com/2mZY1b5YaL — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) October 20, 2024 Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki took a similar tack with Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA) on her MSNBC show “Inside with Jen Psaki.” Newsom argued that Musk was “not the person” he knew in the past and suggested that his association with Trump was what had changed him. He also hinted that it was certainly at least possible that the X owner had some sort of ulterior motive for his plan. “Look, I’ve known Elon for over 20, 25 years, one of America’s great entrepreneurs and innovators. But this is not the person I knew even two years ago. With respect to Elon, I just don’t have the confidence that there’s other things he’s not up to behind the scenes. Not just again what he’s expressing quite publicly and I’m very concerned about a country where people like Elon Musk, others that are sucking up to Donald Trump that will undoubtably be carved out of regulations, undoubtably get massive, even larger federal contracts. It is an American oligarchy that can be formed here.” .@GavinNewsom on Elon Musk: “Look, I've known Elon for over 20, 25 years, one of America's great entrepreneurs and innovators.

"76","https://www.dailywire.com/news/inside-leonard-leos-plan-for-conservatives-to-crush-liberal-dominance","Inside Leonard Leo’s Plan For Conservatives To ‘Crush Liberal Dominance’","In exclusive interview, one of the American Right's most consequential figures lays out how to take the “conservative movement to the next level"" American lawyer and conservative legal activist Leonard Leo wants the conservative movement to become as “impactful and effective as possible.”And he plans to do this by financially backing conservative groups that are focused on more than just ideas and policy, but on “operationalizing and weaponizing” those ideas to “crush liberal dominance at the choke points of influence and power.” Leo is one of the most prolific fundraisers in American politics. He’s also one of the most consequential figures on the American Right. As a leader of the Federalist Society, he has worked for decades to foster strong judicial and legal appointments, and as an advisor to former President Donald Trump on judicial selections, he helped Trump choose the three conservative Supreme Court justices instrumental in overturning Roe v. Wade. After Trump, Leo is quite possibly the man most hated by the Left. And with an estimated $1 billion to spend on aligned groups, the conservative activist holds the attention of both sides of the aisle. In a rare interview with The Daily Wire, published Sunday on the Morning Wire podcast, Leo laid out his vision for how he can use his influence in the movement to empower the types of work that will be necessary to compete with the Left, and win. “As someone involved in philanthropy, I want to make sure that the conservative movement is as impactful as possible in doing things like defending the rule of law, and improving our society and culture,” he shared with The Daily Wire. “That means that the participants in our movement, the many organizations that are involved in trying to improve our society and our culture and the law and politics and public policy, need to be as impactful and effective as possible.” LISTEN TO THE FULL INTERVIEW: Leo informed recipients of his 85 Fund in September that the fund is conducting a review of where its dollars are going — and in the future, he’ll be focused on funding groups that are doing far more than just research. “Vastly insufficient funds are going toward operationalizing and weaponizing those ideas and policies,” he wrote in the letter, prompting a slew of dramatic headlines from liberal media. “When you get to a certain point in a movement’s history, while you always have to continue to develop ideas and to educate, what becomes even more important is operationalizing those ideas, taking the principles and philosophy that you’ve developed, and finding ways to make those a reality in our culture,” Leo continued. “The Left has been very effective at this over the past couple of decades, and it’s time for the conservative movement to be much more leveraged in the way it tries to implement its beliefs.” Part of the Left’s strategy has been to build different kinds of layered institutions and structures, Leo explained to The Daily Wire. First, they developed ideas and philosophies to educate societal influencers and coming generations of academics and professionals. Then they created institutions that could mobilize the people behind those ideas, and created networks that could generate calls to action, protests, and philanthropy. “They’ve mobilized people,” Leo said. “They’ve created infrastructure to get the word out, to train people to be leaders, and for those leaders then to have the resources they need to create communities of people who will go out and do everything from protesting and demonstrating, to writing in the popular press, influencing the entertainment industry, putting pressure on academic institutions, sometimes even litigating, and sometimes working in various international organizations like the United Nations to effect change.” Leo’s letter to grant recipients describes how activists on the Left have created “large funding engines,” both 501(c)(4) as well as 501(c)(3), that push litigation, launch aggressive campaigns, and build extensive networks and talent pipelines. Two of the most prominent leftist funding engines are the “constellation of groups” run by the influential left-wing consulting organizations Arabella Advisors and Tides Network Foundation, which spend over $1 billion a year furthering leftist goals. Students for Justice In Palestine activists protest in Los Angeles, California (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) Leftist groups have been very effective in driving anti-Semitism on college campuses through Students for Justice in Palestine, a 501(c)(3) that has politicized an entire “generation on Palestine,” Leo noted, quoting the New Yorker. He also pointed to the Voter Registration Project, another 501(c)(3) that Leo says has poured over $120 million into groups in swing states to “register Democratic-leaning demographics.” And he mentioned how the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, or WPATH, a 501(c)(3) functioning as a “trade group for activists and healthcare providers who profit from radical transgender policies,” pushes ideological “Standards of Care” used by activists to “strong-arm existing trade groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and British Medical Association into supporting WPATH’s agenda.” Leo wants the conservative movement to be as effective and aggressive, especially given the fights on the horizon. He says the Right will need to build talent pipelines, leverage litigation, and launch “campaign-style tactics to beat back things like ESG and DEI.” And particularly at this moment in time, he argued, after a major Supreme Court case that dealt with how federal agencies interpret the law, the conservative movement is well-positioned to challenge the administrative state. “The regulatory state is now something that’s very much in play,” he said. “Those are very leveraged activities where there’s been some real entrepreneurial spirit by conservatives, but that needs to happen more than it does. And that’s something that we’re just really trying to stress test the movement about, really.” Leo mentioned examples of those talent pipelines and networks on the Right: in business and finance, the Teneo Network, in entertainment, the Moving Picture Institute, in journalism, the Fund for American Studies, the College Fix, and the National Journalism Center. “You need to strengthen those networks,” he said, “and you need to build new networks like those where we don’t presently have them.” “It’s all well and good to educate people,” he reflected. “But it’s very important to take the best and brightest of your movement, the people who have the best strategic vision, the folks who have the greatest capability of entering into and helping to control the choke points of society, it’s really important to find those people, to identify them, to recruit them, and then to make sure that they are part of an effort that’s implementing our philosophy and ideas.” The Left has also leveraged litigation as a “tip of the spear strategy” for decades to pursue its ideological agendas in welfare reform, civil rights, and so forth, Leo said. He believes the right should do the same, using “operationalized litigation as a vehicle for affecting the social and cultural change it wants to see.” “It could be challenging government actions so that you can reinvigorate things like the separation of powers and checks and balances and federalism, those structural protections that really advance the dignity and worth of the human person by limiting government power,” he explained. “It could be challenges to government policies that relate to DEI or other parts of the woke cultural agenda.” There’s nothing wrong with research, policy development, education, and the creation of ideas, Leo said, explaining that there will always be a place for such things in the conservative movement. “Ideas constantly have to be tested,” he noted. “New situations always require new thinking and new education. But as a movement matures and evolves, which the conservative movement has done, it’s time to take what you already know, and to operationalize it, and that means being at the tip of the spear, filing those lawsuits, building those talent pipelines, placing personnel in positions of influence in culture, society, and government, launching campaign-style tactics to beat back things like ESG and DEI. That’s the kind of thing that needs to be done.” And then, Leo argues, conservatives should be trying to influence social and cultural institutions. “Infiltrating the press,” he said. “Infiltrating entertainment.” “These are things that go beyond the normal policy research, white papers, conferences, seminars, educational programs that millions and millions and millions of dollars are spent on every year in the conservative space,” he explained. “And again, there’s a place for some amount of that, but it can’t be at the expense of bringing the conservative movement to the next level and really operationalizing its ideas.” Leo isn’t arguing that the conservative movement is “prehistoric” or unsuccessful in its efforts to change culture. But he does believe conservatives are, to a certain extent, risk-averse by their nature. He described an independent streak amongst conservatives, compared to what he described as the Left’s more “collectivist” way of thinking and organizing. “It’s hard to mobilize the conservative movement in the same way,” he said. “I think some of that does need to change. I think we need to band together more effectively and more frequently. I think we need to test new strategies a little bit more than we do.” He also emphasized that conservatives have had some recent victories, pointing to changes in the legal space, such as the transformation of the federal judiciary and the”beginnings of the deconstruction of the administration state,” as a “huge victory and success.” Liberal group Demand Justice projects “Stop The Steal” on the U.S. Supreme Court (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Demand Justice) For decades, Leo argued, the conservative movement has talked about the structural constitution, separation of powers, checks and balances, and federalism. The conservative movement has educated the country about the importance of that structure, and it has demonstrated — “quite clearly,” according to Leo — that “those aren’t just antiquarian notions, but they’re very important in the here and now.” “Those provisions in our Constitution, they’re what really ultimately protect the dignity and worth of the human person,” he said. “If you look at the course of human history, what has been the greatest threat to human dignity, it’s been the state. It’s been the government. It’s been overreach by the governing power.” Now that the movement has educated the public about those issues and developed concrete theories and approaches, Leo believes conservatives can “operationalize” those ideas by supporting litigation projects that “beat back the administrative state using those constitutional tools, by demonstrating that this excessive power that the administrative state has impinges on the separation of powers.” “It violates the checks and balances of our Constitution,” he argued. “It stops the states of the power that they have and their people have to make decisions. And in all of that, the point we’re making in that litigation is that if you really want to defend the freedom and the dignity and worth of ordinary people in this country, you need to make sure that the regulatory state comports with our Constitution.” “Not surprisingly, the plaintiffs and a number of these different kinds of challenges to the administrative state are very average, ordinary, but wonderful people who produce great value in society,” he added. “They’re small lobstermen and fishermen, for example, from New England and from the Gulf Coast.” Where is the conservative movement best positioned to weaponize its ideas? Leo says that’s in challenging the administrative state. “We are very committed to supporting that enterprise, to as much of an extent as we can,” he said. “We know the ideas. We know how to communicate them. We know how to get people to embrace them. We know how to implement them. And so now it’s just a matter of operationalizing and weaponizing it by incubating litigation and by building talent pipelines of people who can pursue that.” “And then of course,” he added, “when you have an opportunity, when you win elections, for example, you want to have talent pipelines of people who embrace those ideas who can enter into the administrative state and properly clip the wings of these agencies when they overreach.” Former President Donald Trump with Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and his family in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Pressed on how the 2024 election, and potentially another Donald Trump presidency could affect his plans, Leo declined to guess at any outcomes. He’s never been a good predictor when it comes to elections, he said. “Elections obviously matter, but … politics and public policy is downstream from culture,” he argued. “It’s downstream from societal norms. And so if the conservative movement wants to ultimately be successful, it obviously has to be very engaged on issues of politics and public policy. It has to engage leveraged activity like litigation in the legal policy space.” But at the end of the day, according to Leo, the movement needs to be focused on building those pipelines and infrastructure that affect the broader society and culture. “In a way,” he said, “I think that’s even more important than what happens in a particular election cycle. So yes, very important what happens in November, I don’t want to undercut that, but in the medium term, what’s perhaps even more important than elections is the conservative movement building beachheads in areas like news, entertainment, business and finance, corporate C-suites, educational institutions, so that you can begin to have a much more level playing field within society and culture regarding traditional principles, western, traditional America based values.” “Work hard at the politics,” he concluded, “but don’t lose sight of those other social and cultural institutions that do ultimately call the shots in our lives.” Already have an account?

The former president’s age, 78, and mental acuity have become targets lately of Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign and other critics. The WSJ editorial board found no basis for the attacks during a lengthy interview with Trump on Thursday, however. In some ways, Trump seemed more knowledgeable and competent during the 90-minute grilling than he did eight years ago during his first run for the White House, according to WSJ. According to WSJ’s report on the meeting: “Lately Mr. Trump’s detractors have been speculating about his ‘mental decline.’ There’s no sign of such slippage in our Thursday meeting. The 2024 Trump seems more confident and is certainly more knowledgeable about policy than he was in 2015. His discursive style of talking can confuse listeners, but that was equally true nine years ago, and he never appears lost in his thoughts the way President Biden repeatedly did in their June debate.” Harris, who turned 60 on Sunday, has campaigned on the difference in age between herself and the former president, in addition to other issues. In a recent interview on Fox News, Harris said she represents a “new generation of leadership.” Over the weekend, Harris attacked Trump as “increasingly unstable and unhinged.” “He’s becoming increasingly unstable and unhinged, and it requires that response,” Harris told reporters on Saturday, according to CNN. “I think the American people deserve better than someone who actually seems to be unstable.” While Harris continues to question Trump’s fitness for office, she has avoided criticizing 81-year-old President Joe Biden, who’s mental acuity and health was seized on by Democrats who wanted Biden to end his reelection bid after the June 27 presidential debate. During the debate, Biden appeared muddled and nonsensical at times. Biden trailed Trump in polling amid the pressure to drop from the race. Harris has maintained that Biden’s mental acuity has not suffered at all during his time as president, and she has continuously defended the president over questions about his health despite the misgivings voiced by Democrats and donors prior to Biden dropping out of the race.

Former President Donald Trump has taken the lead in every battleground state, according to polling averages calculated by RealClear Polling. Since Thursday, Trump has been edging out Vice President Kamala Harris in the vital battlegrounds; his overall average lead in the states increased by +0.3 by Saturday. In Arizona, Trump is performing his best, up by 1.8 points, followed by Georgia (+1.7), North Carolina (+1.0), and Michigan (+0.9). The former president also holds leads in Nevada (+0.8), Pennsylvania (+0.5), and Wisconsin, where the lead is extremely tight, at +0.1. RealClear Polling calculates the average of numerous polls, including The New York Time/Siena College, The Wall Street Journal, The Hill/Emerson, the Trafalgar Group, and others. RCP’s average for national polls shows Harris ahead 49.2%-47.9% as of Saturday. But the site’s Electoral College page shows Trump being favored to win 219 electoral votes, Harris being favored to get 215 electoral votes, and 104 electoral votes labeled as “toss ups.” And with RCP’s “No Toss-up” option, Trump leads Harris 312-226 after Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan, and Pennsylvania started to lean toward the GOP over the past few weeks. In another positive sign for the Trump team, Democrats down-ballot in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan are boasting of their ties to Trump, according to a report from Axios. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Moreover, betting markets have Trump up. Polymarket’s election forecast has Trump up 59.9% to Harris’ 40.1%. The forecast shows Trump up in every battleground state, and topping Harris by double-digit margins in Georgia and Arizona. Harris is favored to win the popular vote, according to Polymarket, up 69% compared to Trump’s 31%. A report from Forbes, though, says there are positive signs for VP Harris and Democrats, too. Early voting for black Americans in Michigan, for example, is up 2.6% compared to 2020. While Harris is struggling to capture minority voters like past Democrats, she’s still predicted to have a significant lead. Additionally, an estimated 12 million Americans have already cast their ballots in this year’s election, and according to data from TargetSmart, around 5.68 million Democrats have voted, compared to 4.35 million Republicans. About 2 million voters identified as “other” have cast their ballots as well. Of course, it remains unclear how the trends will continue as we near Election Day.

Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Hovde said that there was “no question” that he would back former President Donald Trump’s proposal to ban males from competing in women’s sports, saying it was a major concern for parents in the Badger State. Hovde, who is locked in a close race with Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin, told The Daily Wire that Wisconsin parents were very concerned about the Biden administration’s re-write of Title IX that allows males who identify as transgender into female bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams. He said he would support Trump’s proposal this week to block males from female sports teams during a Fox News town hall. “There’s no question that parents are upset when they’re learning that this is being pushed on their school districts and the Department of Education is saying that they are going to deprive them of funds,” Hovde told The Daily Wire. “If you’re a parent you don’t want your daughters having guys going into their bathrooms and locker rooms. And the girls don’t want that.” Hovde noted that allowing males to compete against females denied biological reality and was dangerous. “Look, my youngest daughter was the female athlete of the year in the state of Wisconsin in 2017. She was a freak athlete,” he said. “And to think we would allow boys to compete in her sports, it’s crazy. A male after they go through puberty has more muscle mass, [is] quicker and bigger, and could become dangerous.” Hovde’s daughter was picked as the Wisconsin State Journal/WisconsinPrepZone.com All-Area Girls Athlete of the Year in 2017 for her participation in soccer, tennis, and basketball. Baldwin, who has opposed measures to keep males out of women’s sports, has already been targeted by Hovde in previous campaign ads on the issue. The Wisconsin Democrat did not respond to multiple requests for interviews with The Daily Wire. Hovde’s campaign also recently put out a pair of campaign ads accusing Baldwin of being “in bed with Wall Street” as she faces conflict of interest allegations over her relationship with New York wealth management advisor Maria Brisbane. In the ads, first reported on by The Daily Wire, several Wisconsin voters accuse Baldwin and Brisbane of living extravagantly while people in Wisconsin suffer from high inflation and illegal immigration. Hovde said on Thursday that the ads are meant to show “what a hypocrite” Baldwin is. “She’s made her brand trying to run against Wall Street, talks about wealth inequality, talks about the wealthy need to pay their fair share, and yet her Wall Street partner designs tax schemes for the uber wealthy and private equity and invests in biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which Sen. Baldwin oversees that committee,” he said. Hovde was referencing reporting that Baldwin sits on a Senate committee that oversees the NIH, which distributes millions in funding to biotech companies, and Brisbane’s professional work managing a biotechnology mutual fund and pushing for investments in small biotech companies in her role as a wealth management advisor. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Both parties are spending tens of millions in Wisconsin as Democrats seek to hang onto their slim two-seat majority in the Senate heading into November. Republicans are optimistic that they will flip both West Virginia and Montana and are looking to contest in other competitive states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. While Baldwin began the summer with a big lead, the race has now tightened with internal polling from the National Republican Senatorial Committee showing Hovde up by one point. If Republicans flip the Senate, Hovde said they needed to focus on getting the deficit under control and closing the border. “We’ve got to create security and safety for our people and our population from the fentanyl, from the criminals, from all the potential terrorists that have poured over our southern border,” he said. Baldwin and Hovde will meet Friday in Madison for the race’s only debate at 7:00 p.m. local time. Already have an account? Your information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City. Arroyo had pointed out to Trump that many Catholics and Christians object to the fertility treatments on moral grounds. The Catholic Church is opposed to IVF and says that it is “morally unacceptable,” teaching that “the gift of human life must be actualized in marriage through the specific and exclusive acts of husband and wife, in accordance with the laws inscribed in their persons and in their union.” “As you know,” Arroyo pointed out, “some Catholics feel, and the Church believes, that when you implement this technology, you’re killing embryos. Will you have a religious exemption to your IVF mandate for religious organizations and businesses that feel, ‘This violates my religious principles?'” “I haven’t been asked that, but it sounds like a pretty good idea, frankly,” Trump responded, adding: “Even Catholics, a lot of them, they want IVF. It’s fertilization, basically, they view that as helping the family, helping parents have a child, and it’s a very popular thing, but certainly if there is a religious problem, I think people should go with that.

The president spoke at the 79th Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City, a charity dinner where presidential candidates poke fun at one another. Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris skipped the event, making her the first presidential nominee to skip the dinner in decades. As Trump spoke, he referenced the July 13 attempt on his life, when a would-be assassin shot him in the ear, narrowly missing his head, and killing a father seated behind Trump named Corey Comperatore. “Is that luck, or was that God that did that?” he asked the assembled guests. “And I think it was God that did that, I do.” “I have a very fresh appreciation for how blessed we are by God’s providence and his divine mercy,” he continued. “I was not supposed to be here tonight, that I can tell you. So with God’s help I know there is nothing that cannot be achieved, we can achieve so much good with this country.” (Photo by TIMOTHY A.

Trump celebrated Popieluszko’s martyrdom on Saturday, praising him as a “truly great Catholic priest” and a “source of tremendous spiritual strength for the Polish Solidarity Movement and, indeed, the entire nation of Poland, in the 1980s.” “Yesterday, in Chicago, I was honored to sign a Commemoration about this solemn anniversary and present it to Father Jerzy’s nephew, Marek Popiełuszko, as well as receive from him a book of Father Jerzy’s sermons and other beautiful mementos to remember the life of this extraordinary man of heroic virtue,” he said in a post on Truth Social. On Thursday evening, Trump also spoke with EWTN’s Raymond Arroyo, who asked the former president whether he is “telling voters something about [his] spiritual journey.” “No, I don’t think so, it’s just beautiful to me,” Trump responded. “I look at the whole thing, the words, and the pictures, the pictures are so beautiful.

Harris got better marks when it came to issues such as health care and housing affordability. Overall, the newspaper said, the candidates were “virtually tied” across the battleground states the poll examined. RCP’s average for national polls showed Harris ahead 49.2%-47.7% as of Thursday. But the site’s Electoral College page shows Trump being favored to win 219 electoral votes, Harris being favored to get 215 electoral votes, and 104 electoral votes labeled as “Toss ups.” And with RCP’s “No Toss-up” option, Trump leads Harris 312-226 after Wisconsin, Nevada, Michigan, and Pennsylvania started to lean toward the GOP over the past few weeks. The Senate, according to RCP, looks to be leaning toward a narrow GOP majority. RCP’s “Battle for the House 2024” page shows Republicans favored to get 207 seats, Democrats to get 196 states, and 32 seats that remain “Toss Ups.” Its “2024 Governor Races” page shows 23 Democrats, 26 Republicans, and one — New Hampshire — in the “Toss Ups” category.

Miller was arrested for allegedly having a fake pass to the rally — which Miller has denied — and numerous illegal, loaded weapons in his vehicle. Sheriff Bianco told the press following Miller’s arrest that his team likely stopped a third assassination attempt on the former president. “I probably did have deputies that prevented the third assassination attempt,” Bianco said. “I truly do believe that we prevented another assassination attempt.” In his lawsuit, Miller says Bianco “wanted to create a narrative so as to be viewed as a ‘heroic’ Sheriff who saved Presidential candidate Trump from a third assassination attempt.” Miller further contends that Bianco made false statements about him even after he was notified by Secret Service and the FBI that they did not view Miller as a threat. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 “Even after being notified by both United States Secret Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation that they did not believe Miller was a threat and declined to interview him, Defendant Bianco continued to make preposterous allegations against Miller, holding press conferences perpetuating his delusional and false narrative,” the complaint reads. On Tuesday, Bianco told the Los Angeles Times that it was possible that Miller had not been at the rally to hurt Trump. “Three days later, IF everything Mr. Miller has said is true, and I really hope it is, then he probably wasn’t there to hurt former President Trump,” the sheriff said via text message. “I definitely said it and can’t change that.” “There is no way for us to know for sure,” Bianco added. “That is up to further investigation, if any, from the FBI.” Miller has spoken to the press in the aftermath of the arrest and repeatedly stated that he’s a supporter of Trump, “100%.” He also said he’s been to numerous Trump rallies and typically informs officers at the rallies that he has legal firearms in his vehicle. However, at the Coachella, California rally, where Miller was arrested, he said his guns were not legal. Miller said he didn’t realize there were different laws in California than in Nevada and made a mistake.

Former President Donald Trump again called for Vice President Kamala Harris to have a cognitive test after her combative interview with Fox News host Bret Baier on Wednesday. In reaction to the interview, Trump criticized Harris for pivoting to attack him when asked about her policy positions. Baier’s interview with Harris lasted nearly 30 minutes as he pressed her on issues from the border crisis to what she would do differently from President Joe Biden. Trump praised Baier and criticized Harris’s record on illegal immigration on Truth Social after the pre-taped interview aired. “Great job by Bret Baier in his Interview with Lyin’ Kamala Harris. She has a massive and irredeemable case of TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME – So bad, in fact, that she is barely able to talk about any subject other than the man who had the best economy ever, the strongest border in history, and who just got the UNANIMOUS ENDORSEMENT OF THE U.S. Border Patrol, ME! Their Endorsement was a TREMENDOUS HONOR!!! They said that Comrade Kamala did a terrible job, the absolute worst in memory, and can’t be allowed to do it again,” he posted. In the same post, he called for Harris to have a cognitive test, echoing a call on Sunday when he said Harris had “slow and lethargic” answers during interviews. “She is also the WORST Vice President in history, but hopefully will soon be GONE,” Trump said Wednesday. “Again, congratulations to Bret Baier on a tough but very fair interview, one that clearly showed how totally incompetent Kamala is. For the good of our Nation, her inferior Cognitive ability must be tested at once!” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Baier asked Harris about her campaign slogan: “It’s time to turn the page.” “So what are you turning the page from?” he asked, noting that the Biden-Harris administration has been in charge for more than three years. “Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other, rhetoric and an approach to leadership that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know. The strength of leadership is based on who you lift up,” Harris replied. Harris was also pressed on the record number of illegal immigrants who entered the United States under the Biden-Harris administration’s watch, her handling of Biden’s apparent cognitive decline, and her economic proposals.

Senator JD Vance (R-OH) dismantled Vice President Kamala Harris’ Wednesday evening interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier during a brief appearance on “Fox & Friends” Thursday morning. Vance listed several of the points that the American people had expressed a desire to hear her address and then went on to describe her responses — many of which were rambling non-answers that aimed only for pivot points from which she could turn and attack former President Donald Trump. “Last night, Kamala Harris once again refused to name a single policy difference between her and Joe Biden,” Vance captioned the clip he posted to X. “Does that sound like a new way forward to you?” WATCH: Last night, Kamala Harris once again refused to name a single policy difference between her and Joe Biden.

Kamala Harris has been.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 “What I saw was a person who not just didn’t have the skill to navigate a tough interview, but doesn’t know how to explain her record because her record is not possible to explain away to the American people,” he continued. “So she dipped and dodged questions for 25 minutes. That’s not leadership and that’s not contrition.” “I think the American people would like to see from their vice president an acknowledgment that she screwed up, it’s why we have so many of these problems,” he concluded. “Real leadership would be promising a new course and acknowledging, well, the old course didn’t work.” Baier noted during his Wednesday broadcast of “Special Report” — during which the interview aired — that Harris’ team had cut the interview short by arriving late. She then proceeded to filibuster every question to the point that even the best of analysts would be able to glean very little new information. Already have an account?

President Donald Trump said this week that the solution to stopping men from playing in women’s sports was to simply ban it at the federal level through executive action. Trump made the remarks during a Fox News town hall with female voters on Wednesday afternoon with host Harris Faulkner. When asked, nearly every woman in the audience raised their hand and said that men pretending to be women playing in women’s sports was a serious concern for them. Linda from Georgia asked Trump: “How do you plan on addressing the transgender issue in women’s sports?” “I have nine grandchildren, six of them female, all playing sports, and we are very concerned for their safety, not just on the field and the courts, but in their locker rooms as well,” she said.

Former President Donald Trump has pulled ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the White House race across six key swing states, one betting market announced on Wednesday, less than three weeks out from Election Day. Polymarket showed Trump leading Harris 68%-32% in Arizona, where 11 electoral votes are at stake; 64%-36% in Georgia, where 16 electoral votes are at stake; and 59%-41% in Pennsylvania, where 19 electoral votes are at stake. The site also showed Trump above Harris 55%-45% in Michigan, where 15 electoral votes are at stake; 54%-46% in Wisconsin, where 10 electoral votes are at stake; and 51%-49% in Nevada, where six electoral votes are at stake. Trump now has the lead in every swing state. pic.twitter.com/ie7NWK4zYn — Polymarket (@Polymarket) October 16, 2024 Harris was performing better than Trump in some of the states, including Wisconsin and Nevada, just days ago. There is still time for the odds to shift back and forth as the candidates and their allies conduct a final campaign blitz. Polymarket’s overall forecast on Wednesday showed that Trump was ahead of Harris 58.5%-41.3%. Trump’s advantage has grown since the beginning of October, when the betting market showed him and Harris virtually tied. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Harris, who became the Democrats’ presidential nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race over the summer, has begun to ramp up her interview schedule after largely ducking the press early in her campaign. Despite relatively friendly interviews with ABC’s “The View,” late-night host Stephen Colbert on CBS, and others, Harris has struggled to answer how she differs from Biden and prove that she does not need to lean on a teleprompter. Several other betting markets also show Trump ahead of Harris in the 2024 White House race. The RealClearPolitics (RCP) average, which includes Polymarket and some competitors, shows Trump leading Harris 57.7%-41.3%. Although Trump is surging ahead in betting markets, polls still indicate a close race between him and Harris. RCP’s average for national polls show Harris ahead 49.2%-47.5% and Trump leading 48.3%-47.6% in battleground states. Polymarket showed Harris as favored to win the popular vote, with a 64%-36% advantage over Trump. It also showed a 79% chance of Republicans taking over the Senate and 55% odds of the Democrats winning control of the House. Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, the chairman and CEO of Duquesne Family Office, said on Wednesday the overall market — in which multiple stock indices rose to record highs this week — anticipates Trump to be victorious. “In the last 12 days, the market and the inside of the market is very convinced Trump is going to win,” he told Bloomberg. “You can see it in the bank stocks, you can see it in crypto, you can even see it in DJT, his social media company.” Already have an account?

Worse, their cities are being used as illegal alien dumping grounds."" Former President Donald Trump warned on Wednesday that black communities will lose their “political power” if Vice President Kamala Harris gets four years in the White House, arguing that black neighborhoods will be overrun by migrants. Trump posted the warning on Truth Social as he boasted that Harris appears to be losing ground among black voters. A New York Times/Siena poll released last week shows Harris trailing President Joe Biden’s 2020 numbers among black voters by around 10 points. The same poll shows Trump performing better than he has with black voters as 15% said they are backing the Republican nominee. “Kamala’s support is collapsing with Black voters. Inflation is hell. Worse, their cities are being used as illegal alien dumping grounds. If Kamala gets 4 more years, the Black Community loses its political power forever because their neighborhoods will all be majority migrant,” Trump wrote. Illegal immigration and the economy have been the focal points of Trump’s campaign. Last month, Trump told supporters in North Carolina that illegal immigrants let in by the Biden-Harris administration’s border policies are “crushing the jobs and wages of African American workers and Hispanic American workers, and also union members.” “They’re taking your jobs. … What we’re doing to this country is so sad,” he added. Under Biden and Harris’ watch, Customs and Border Protection has reported over 10 million illegal immigrant encounters at the southern border along with nearly two million more “gotaways.” Cities with large black populations, such as New York and Chicago, have seen massive surges in migrant arrivals since Biden and Harris took office. Trump has also reached out to black voters by contrasting his policies with the Biden-Harris administration’s record on the economy and inflation. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 “The inflation is absolutely destroying our middle class, our working class, virtually every class. Inflation is a disaster in our country,” Trump said during the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) Conference in July, adding, “People can’t buy houses. They no longer have the American Dream. Young people, young black people, they don’t have the American Dream anymore.” To address high inflation, Trump said, “We have to bring down the cost of energy. … This was all started by a bad energy policy by Joe Biden.” Earlier this week, Harris dismissed concerns that she’s struggling with black voters, saying, “One, that’s not my experience. Two, Election Day has not arrived yet.” “It’s incumbent on me to earn their support, that’s why I’m talking to folks about the work I’ve done in my career,” she added. Already have an account?

A billionaire investor said on Wednesday that the market — in which multiple stock indices rose to record highs this week — anticipates victory by former President Donald Trump.

MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 Druckenmiller emphasized how it is an “evolving situation” and he personally does not have “conviction” on who will emerge the winner. But Druckenmiller explained that he likes “market indicators” for the economy and finance, as well as elections. “I remember how right the market was on Ronald Reagan in 1980, despite what the pundits were saying,” he said. Trump has been surging ahead in betting markets over the past several days, even though polling shows a close race between him and Vice President Kamala Harris. Druckenmiller took a swipe at the polls, saying, “Who knows what these polls even mean. No one even responds to them anymore.” The hedge fund manager also talked about which political party will take control of one or both chambers of Congress. He said a “blue sweep is extremely unlikely,” noting that Republicans seem to be on the verge of taking back the Senate even if Harris wins the presidential race. Druckenmiller said a “red sweep” is more likely than a Trump presidency with a “blue Congress” because he doubts voters backing the former president would split the ticket for Democrats in Congress. The economy could be “potentially stronger” for three to six months with a “red sweep,” Druckenmiller said before cautioning that a “bad response” in fixed-income markets could “snuff out” the equity rally. Regardless of what the markets may be predicting, Druckenmiller said he would not personally support Trump or Harris and would “probably write in someone.” Although he contended both candidates are “unified on some things” like industrial policy, Druckenmiller noted concerns with Trump’s tariffs plan and negotiation tactics with foreign countries. Harris would be “much worse in terms of anti-bigness, anti-business, and regulation,” Druckenmiller said. Already have an account? Your information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Former President Donald Trump sat down with the hosts of the “Bussin’ with the Boys” podcast to talk about the election, the insanity of transgender athletes in women’s sports, and his resilience following multiple assassination attempts and the lawfare against him. During the interview released on Tuesday, Trump was asked a host of questions, including how he planned to unite the country given the heated, divided state we have now. “You want to see the country united, but we have two very different, you have a very conservative side and a conservative side and then you have people that want to see an open border and things,” Trump said. “A lot of it’s so far out, like for instance, they want men playing in women’s sports,” he added. “I don’t think I could ever say I’m thrilled about that, okay? I’ve seen it. I’ve seen people really hurt.” Trump talked about the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris where two boxers who failed chromosome tests were allowed to compete against women. “And in the women’s boxing, they both won gold medals and you saw the one, the young Italian girl got hit a couple of times,” Trump said. “She said ‘bye-bye’ … she got hit very hard. But she’s fighting a man.” He then reiterated something he’s said before, which is that “success will bring the country together,” something he said he started to see half-way into his presidency. MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 “I’m telling you the country was coming together,” Trump said. “Despite the fact that, you know, what we were saying before about the divisions.” “I’ll tell you I experienced unbelievable success leading the country just prior to COVID,” he added. “Numbers at the stock market [were] at an all-time, everything was like perfect and the country was coming together.” Later, the former president was asked about his resiliency, and Trump said everything they’ve done to him “has made me popular,” which helps him handle it. “I try not to think about it. … I just say, screw it. Whatever happens, happens,” Trump said. “And do the right thing. I try to take it less seriously than I should. I should take it more seriously, but if I did that, I don’t think I’d be with you guys today. I really don’t.

And then he will keep, like he started calling doctors that saved the lives of the [Butler, PA] shooting victims, these country doctors…and he kept hitting country doctors.” “Trump had that line on the pod where he goes ‘yo, they lie about me all the time, it’s hard for me to do that about them.’ He’s like ‘I’m basically truthful,’” Schulz continued, before playing the clip from the show. “And it was so funny, they are trying to use it against him…But it’s so funny, that it just disarms you.” Charlamagne tha God appeared to agree that Trump’s appearance on the podcast helped the Republican nominee. “I had a young black man — 20 something years old — not going to say his name …he [came] to me this morning…he goes ‘Flagrant’s’ going to get Trump elected,” the podcast host said. “The interview was fire bro,” Schulz replied. “The interview was fire. I don’t know what to tell you…there’s so many moments where he’s just having fun and that is infectious.” MATT WALSH’S ‘AM I RACIST?’ COMING TO DAILYWIRE+ OCT. 28 At one point in the interview, the two also talked about how both sides of the political aisle have used the same clips from the “Flagrant” podcast to promote their agenda. One part was from Trump’s appearance when he hit back at the New York Times headline that read, “Trump’s Speeches, Increasingly Angry and Rambling, Reignite the Question of Age.” Trump said what he does is called “The Weave” and then described it, saying it actually takes a great deal of memory to do it, as previously reported. Schulz said when Trump explained “he doesn’t ramble, he weaves,” [Vice President] Kamala’s [Harris] headquarters “saw the video and said “yo, make a video out of that. Look how ridiculous this is.’” “But then Trump’s team is also like ‘yo, make a video out of that, that s**t is fire,’” he added. “So the same piece of content was used to support the candidate and to try to trash the candidate.” Already have an account?

"97","https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-party-that-hates-men-is-wondering-why-theyre-losing-male-voters","The Party That Hates Men Is Wondering Why They’re Losing Male Voters","In recent days, we've seen Kamala's campaign go to increasingly desperate lengths to appeal to men. It’s been a little over two months since the Kamala Harris campaign unveiled their ace-in-the-hole — their foolproof plan to win over male voters and dominate the upcoming presidential election. This plan didn’t take the form of a campaign platform, or a stump speech, or anything like that. Instead, it took the form of an ingenious little totem — one you could even purchase for a mere $40 plus shipping — that was located in the online merch store of the Kamala Harris campaign. I’m talking, of course, about the official Harris-Walz embroidered camo hat. Axios called the hat a “status symbol” for Democrats. This hat, Politico told us, is “more important than you think.” They wrote that it could even decide the outcome of the election as a kind of “tipping point.” According to CNN, that hat signified that the Harris campaign was serious about burnishing their “credentials” among young voters, particularly white men. Watch: There was so much optimism. Tim Walz is a “hunter,” CNN assured us. That’s why he needs the “blaze orange” hat. And thanks to this hat, men are going to recognize how authentic and masculine Tim Walz is. Men will sit around at the pub saying to each other, “Gee whiz, that Tim Walz is a real man’s man. Did you see his orange hat?” The Trump campaign won’t even stand a chance. After all, their hats are red. And men don’t respond to that. They only respond to “blaze orange.” That was the consensus in the corporate press. But two months later, it’s starting to look like the unthinkable has happened. The Harris-Walz camo hat has not, in fact, exerted a kind of mind-control over hundreds of thousands of men across the country. It has not guaranteed a Kamala Harris landslide, as expected. Instead, Kamala Harris’ campaign is in freefall among men, of every demographic group. A New York Times poll just found that nationally, Trump has a significant lead among likely male voters. He’s up by more than 10 points. Meanwhile, a USA Today poll found that in Arizona, a majority of Latino men between the ages of 18 to 34 support Donald Trump. Among Latino men aged 45 to 49, Trump’s support is even higher, at 57%. For their part, black men are also increasingly turned off by Kamala Harris’ campaign. The New York Times reports that Kamala Harris, quote, “still significantly trails Joe Biden’s 2020 share” of likely black voters. And the numbers show that she’s especially far behind among black men. And you know what that means. It means that Barack Obama is, once again, very disappointed. Now, it’s no secret that a lot of things disappoint Barack Obama. He was disappointed when George Zimmerman exercised his right of self-defense to save his life. He was disappointed when Americans elected Donald Trump. He was disappointed when he had to cancel his 60th birthday party on Martha’s Vineyard because the plebes noticed that he was disregarding the COVID rules he pretended to care about. Pretty much everything that happens somehow ends up disappointing poor Barack Obama. But this time, his brow is really furrowed. He’s more disappointed than you will ever know. And specifically, he’s disappointed in black men for not supporting Kamala Harris enough. Watch: This is how you know the internal polls are just as bad as the public polls. The party of joy is now the party of scolding and finger-wagging. He’s not even hiding his contempt. According to Barack Obama, black men can’t possibly be upset with inflation, or crime, or anything like that. They have to hate women. That’s the only possible explanation for why Kamala Harris hasn’t already locked up 100% of the black vote. What’s extraordinary about this is that Donald Trump isn’t even polling particularly well among black voters. He’s just polling a lot better than any other Republican has in recent history. Trump has something like 20% support among black men, which is much higher than Democrats are used to. But Democrats recognize that this relatively small shift could very well cost them the election. It could flip states like Pennsylvania, which is where Obama was when he delivered that little dressing-down. So, Obama is furious. He needs black support for Kamala Harris to exceed 90%. But men, of all demographic groups, aren’t going along with the program. That’s why, in recent days, we’ve seen Kamala’s campaign and her supporters go to increasingly desperate lengths to appeal to men. That cringy ad that went viral last week is just the latest example. It was created by a former director for Jimmy Kimmel named Jacob Reed. In case you were fortunate enough to miss this at the time, here’s a brief except: It probably won’t surprise you to learn that all of the men in this ad are actors, and they’re mostly lying about their lives. One of them says he braids his daughter’s hair, but he doesn’t even have a daughter, apparently. He also claims he deadlifts 500lbs. We can only assume he meant 500 ounces. But something that might surprise you is that, in the days since this video has been mocked extensively all over the Internet, the creator of the ad, Jacob Reed, has not gone into hiding. He hasn’t changed his name and fled the country in shame, never to be heard from again — although that reaction would be reasonable and prudent at this point. Instead, he just appeared on national television to double down on the concept and explain why everyone else misunderstands his marketing genius. Watch: CNN had the guy who made the cringiest ad of all time on and he’s as clueless as you’d expect 😂 pic.twitter.com/eBbSxH9Aeb — Champagne Joshi (@JoshWalkos) October 12, 2024 So he’s explaining the joke, which is always a great sign. Comedy is about “juxtaposition,” says Jacob Reed. Get it? He’s juxtaposing the idea of a stereotypically rugged man, with things that aren’t stereotypically masculine. It’s funny because those two things are being juxtaposed. That’s comedy, as explained by the former director of Jimmy Kimmel — a comedian who hasn’t told a joke in 20 years. In addition to not being funny, this guy’s also not very smart because, without realizing it, he proved the point I made when I discussed this ad last week. On the Left, to be a “real man” means simply playing second fiddle to women. Any man who submits and assumes a subservient role is automatically a role model for all men, in their view. Go fetch the tampons and braid some hair, and then you’re a real man. That’s the idea. This is a debased, matriarchal view of men that fails to resonate with any man aside from the most effeminate and testosterone-depleted. It is a vision of masculinity that appeals almost entirely to liberal feminist women, and no one else. But increasingly, it’s becoming apparent that no one in the Kamala Harris campaign has ever spoken to a man who is normal and well-adjusted. That’s the only explanation for why the campaign voluntarily uploaded this footage of Tim Walz going pheasant hunting the other day. They must’ve thought this would be a slam dunk. After all, Walz was bringing his own gun. So, presumably, his handlers assumed that he would know how to load it for the cameras. But that assumption turned out to be very incorrect. Watch: Tim Walz brought his own gun, a beretta, to hunt for pheasants, he tells me. “ I bought it when I was we shooting a lot of trap,” the Minnesota governor said. pic.twitter.com/K1zGkWYEPY — Shawna Mizelle (@shawnamizelle) October 12, 2024 It looks like it’s his first time ever handling a firearm of any kind. It definitely doesn’t look like a guy who’s familiar, in any way, with the firearm he supposedly owns. As Larry Taunton put it, it looks like Tim Walz stepped out of an LL Bean catalog, eager to impress everyone with his hunting prowess. And everyone sees through it in about ten seconds. A lot of people are comparing this to Michael Dukakis’ decision to ride around in an Abrams tank, decked out in a helmet. The stunt was supposed to make Dukakis look strong on national defense, but it ended up making him look like a clown. But really, that’s not a fair comparison. Dukakis, for all his faults, never claimed to be a tank commander. He never said he was an expert on tanks, or someone who drove tanks all the time. By contrast, as you heard from CNN at the top of this segment, Tim Walz has portrayed himself as a “hunter.” That’s why they sell the Harris-Walz camo hats. And now we’re learning that, like every other biographical detail we’ve been told about Tim Walz, it’s a lie. In reality, he didn’t serve in Afghanistan, even though he repeatedly suggested otherwise. He’s not actually afraid of spicy food, as he told Kamala Harris. He wasn’t in Hong Kong during the massacre at Tiananmen Square. And now we learn that he has no idea how to load a firearm. Think about how desperate the campaign would have to be, in order to send Walz out there with that shotgun. It’s not just the fact that they decided to stage a corny photo-op. It’s the fact that they apparently didn’t do any kind of preparation beforehand — even basic stuff like making sure he wouldn’t make a fool out of himself. And then no one stopped this video from being released. In fact, the campaign began promoting it. It reminds you of all of those staged photos of politicians standing over a grill on July 4th, wearing a spotless apron with the creases still in it and holding a shiny spatula that an intern just bought from Lowe’s 15 minutes ago. Compare this disaster to Donald Trump’s viral video with the golfer Bryson DeChambeau a few months ago. That racked up more than 10 million views because it was authentic. Everyone watching the video could tell that Trump loves golfing. He didn’t struggle to hold his clubs. It obviously wasn’t his first time on the golf course. It was evident he loved the sport and everything about it. And he was surprisingly good, too. In fact, he started hitting a few drives that were better than Bryson’s. The Harris-Walz ticket can’t match this authenticity because nothing about the candidates is genuine. Put a Glock in Kamala’s hands, and she’ll do exactly what Tim Walz did. When candidates are this fake, lame and desperate, their surrogates don’t have much to go on. So they end up sounding inauthentic and desperate, too. Here for example are Julia Roberts and Jennifer Garner, giving what could be the single most inauthentic acting performance in their respective careers, which is saying something. Watch: So Julia Roberts wants women to go home and nag their husbands and boyfriends into supporting Kamala Harris. If they do that, then prices will come down and we’ll have joy again. Nevermind the fact that Kamala Harris is the sitting vice president and that, by Kamala Harris’ own admission, she bears responsibility for the Biden administration’s policies. Don’t think about that. Just berate as many men as you can find until they relent. And then there’s Jennifer Garner saying that men who support Kamala are “sexy.” Perhaps that will convince men to rush out to the polls. If they aren’t convinced by the camo hat, or by a lecture from Barack Obama, maybe they’ll do it to impress Jennifer Garner. But I highly doubt it. If you’re a Left-wing male and you’re passionate about Kamala Harris, at this point you need to be someone like Harry Sisson, the DNC shill who posts a lot on TikTok. Like him, you can’t have any shame or self-respect whatsoever. Here was his pitch to men ahead of the election: There are A LOT of cowardly men out there who are voting for Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/XuFM94arDP — Harry Sisson (@harryjsisson) October 13, 2024 “When I was growing up…” says a guy who looks like he’s 12. And here we have the Democrats going back to the same well. A well that is completely dry because there was never any water in it to begin with. This is all they have on the Left. They don’t know how to appeal to men, so after the gimmicks fail, they resort to insufferable, pretentious, irritating lectures delivers by the most annoying and inauthentic people on Earth. It’s true that men will sometimes respond to a little bit of harshness and tough talk. But only when that tough talk is delivered by someone who is serious and strong — a leader of men. Not a mousy little dork who would cry and call his mom if he got a flat tire. But this is the strategy the Kamala Harris campaign is now using in order to win over male voters. It’s a mixture of insults and condescension. But all of this stuff fails because the Democrats’ message to men is fundamentally emasculating and debasing. That’s the point of it. It’s why they’re promoting Doug Emhoff as a prototypical male — even after he had an affair with his nanny, and even after he was accused of hitting his ex-girlfriend. The position of the Harris-Walz campaign is that none of that matters. In their eyes, you’re “masculine” as long as you do one thing, and one thing only, which is to submit to whatever liberal women want you to do. The problem for the Kamala Harris campaign — the reason they’re flailing so publicly — is that despite Democrats’ efforts to destroy it, actual masculinity still exists in this country. Men still exist. And in just a couple of weeks, to the great horror of Julia Roberts and Barack Obama, those men will vote. And they very well may be the ones who decide this election.

Former President Donald Trump said on Sunday night that Vice President Kamala Harris should take a “test on cognitive stamina and agility,” arguing that her “slow and lethargic” answers during interviews are concerning. Trump called on Harris, 59, to pass a cognitive test after the Democratic presidential nominee released a medical report on Saturday, which stated that she has “the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.” Harris used her medical report to attack Trump, suggesting that the 78-year-old former president is hiding whether he is fit for office. Trump fired back, writing on Truth Social, “I believe it is very important that Kamala Harris pass a test on Cognitive Stamina and Agility. Her actions have led many to believe that there could be something very wrong with her.” “Even 60 Minutes and CBS, in order to protect Lyin’ Kamala, illegally and unscrupulously replaced an answer she had given, which was totally ‘bonkers,’ with another answer that had nothing to do with the question asked,” Trump added. “Also, she is slow and lethargic in answering even the easiest of questions. We just went through almost four years of that, we shouldn’t have to do it again!” Harris was slammed by conservatives, including Trump, for dodging questions on illegal immigration during her “60 Minutes” interview last week, an interview from which the news show still has not released the transcripts. U.S. senators and former CBS reporters have called on “60 Minutes” to release the transcripts after the news show was blasted for appearing to edit the interview with Harris in a way that helped her. The Trump campaign responded to Harris’ calls for Trump to release more medical records by pointing to a doctor’s report from last November along with “detailed reports” on Trump’s recovery following the assassination attempt on him in July. In November of 2023, Trump released a three-paragraph letter from his doctor which stated that the former president’s “overall health is excellent,” adding that his “cognitive exams were exceptional.” Trump campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement on Saturday, “President Trump has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician, as well as detailed reports from Dr. Ronny Jackson who treated him after the first assassination attempt. All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief.” Dr. Jackson is a Republican congressman representing Texas and served as White House physician during the Obama and Trump administrations.

The man who was arrested with firearms over the weekend outside a rally for former President Donald Trump in California is speaking out about the arrest after the county’s sheriff said he believes that it was an “assassination attempt.” The Riverside County Sheriff’s Office said 49-year-old Vem Miller was stopped Saturday evening in a black SUV and was found “to be illegally in possession of a shotgun, a loaded handgun, and a high-capacity magazine.” Miller, who is a registered Republican, told the media after he was released from jail that he is a Trump supporter and that he was “shocked” by the accusations that he was being viewed as a potential assassin. “These accusations are complete bulls***,” Miller said. “I’m an artist, I’m the last person that would cause any violence and harm to anybody.” Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco addressed Miller’s remarks during a press conference, saying that he did not care what he had to say because it had no bearing on the investigation. Miller was taken into custody without incident and booked at the John J. Benoit Detention Center for possession of a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine. Miller was offered bail and was released after posting the $5,000, the New York Post reported. The Trump campaign, in a statement to The Daily Wire, praised the work of local law enforcement in securing the venue. “We are aware of news reports about the arrest and are currently monitoring the situation and gathering more information,” the campaign said. Bianco said at a press conference Sunday evening that the vehicle had “an obviously fake license plate,” which sparked further investigation. “During that investigation, the deputy eventually found multiple passports with multiple names, multiple driver’s licenses with different names, the vehicle was unregistered and the license plate was what we in law enforcement would recognize as one that is homemade and indicative of a group of individuals that claim to be sovereign citizens,” he continued. “I truly do believe that we prevented another assassination attempt,” he added. Miller reportedly denied in an interview with a reporter that he was a member of any kind of sovereign citizen group. A joint federal law enforcement statement was released Sunday indicating that federal authorities are aware of the incident and are investigating. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office U.S. Secret Service and FBI are aware of the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office’s arrest on Saturday,” the statement said. “The U.S. Secret Service assesses that the incident did not impact protective operations and former President Trump was not in any danger.” “While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing,” the statement continued. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office, U.S. Secret Service and FBI extend their gratitude to the deputies and local partners who helped ensure the safety of last night’s events.” Already have an account?
