### Goals

-   Fire up R Studio, understand basic operations
-   Use rio::import to load data
-   Use the tidyverse package dplyr to sort and filter -- Identify
    trends in your data.

<br>

### Get Organized

-   Create a new directory for your data work this week: DJNF_data.\
-   Download rstudio_first.zip. 
-   Unzip in DJNF_data.\
-   Open Intro_to_R_2024.rproj.\
-   Open DJNF_Intro-to_R_RStudio.rmd.

<br> <br>

#### Orientation to R Studio

<img src="RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gradient.png" width="150" height="50"/>
<br>\
<br>

```         
There are four main windows:  

--Script writing, R Markdown, Table Viewer: Upper Left  
--Environment - data loaded in R: Upper Right  
--Console - write commands in R: Lower Left  
--File Manager and Html table viewer: Bottom Right  
```

<br>

**Chunks: The gray boxes have live R code. Click the green arrow at the
right on line 55 and run the help.start() command**

``` {message="FALSE," warning="FALSE"}
help.start()
```

<br> <br>

#### Install software to grab data

```         
Tidyverse: Eight separate software packages to perform
data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming

Rio: Easy importing features 
Janitor: Data cleaning
```

**Below, remove the hash tags \# and run the chunk**

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("rio") 
#install.packages("janitor")
```

After you install a package on your hard drive, you bring the software
in active memory by loading a library

Libraries are bits of software you will have to load each time into R to
make things run.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
#load the librar for rio 
#load the librar for janitor

```

Check to see what's installed by clicking on "Packages" tab in File
Manager, lower right pane <br>

#### Data

```         
Open [this file in Google Sheets:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y2w31HHwE31N9pJoIB1W8oWgW7citB4hzjo99XfwVqo/edit#gid=357643135)


1) Select RealMediaSalaries2 tab

IRE Old School: Four Corners Test!
13 Columns
1658 Rows

Numberic data in Salary, Years Experience
Mixed string data in Gender Identity / Ethnicity, Job duties
```

<br> <br>

#### Import Data

```{r}
MediaBucks <- rio::import("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y2w31HHwE31N9pJoIB1W8oWgW7citB4hzjo99XfwVqo/edit#gid=357643135", sheet = "RealMediaSalaries2")

```

<br> What happened? Look at the table

```{r}
#head provides a peak at the first six rows of data
head(MediaBucks)
```

What happened?

R grabbed the spreadsheet from a Google Sheet\
We told R to grab the first sheet, RealMediaSalaries2\
R created a dataframe called MediaBucks\
basics of R: \<- is known as an “assignment operator.”\
It means: “Make the object named to the left equal to the output of the
code to the right.”

<br> <br>

#### Explore Data

How many rows?

```{r}
nrow(MediaBucks)
```

How many columns?

```{r}
#use the command ncol to determine the number of columns
```

Dimensions: Gives number rows, then columns

```{r}
dim(MediaBucks)
```

Names of your columns

```{r}
#use the command colnames to determine the number of columns

```

OR

```{r}
names(MediaBucks)
```

Check data types

```{r}
#During class, remove hashtag on next line and run chunk
#str(MediaBucks)
```

Let's look at the first six rows

```{r}
#Display the first six rows of data
```

Here is a quick way to view the range of your data

```{r}
summary(MediaBucks$Salary)
```

Size and scope

```{r}
sum(MediaBucks$Salary, na.rm=TRUE)
```

\$106 million! for 1,658 journalists

Context: NYT earnings in 2022 = \$174 m Facebook profit for one day:
\$129 million (Q32023=\$11.6B)

average

```{r}
#We just used sum to determine total salaries.
#mean is the command to determine averages.
#replace sum for mean: sum(MediaBucks$Salary, na.rm=TRUE)

```

Distribution by increments of ten

```{r}
quantile(MediaBucks$Salary, c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9), na.rm=TRUE)
```

Distribution by quarter increments

```{r}
quantile(MediaBucks$Salary, c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.9, 0.99), na.rm=TRUE)
```

<br>

#### Navigation Tips

```         
Shortcut Commands
Tab - Autocomplete
In Console Window (lower left) 
--Control (or Command) + UP arrow - last lines run
Control (or Command) + Enter - Runs current or selected lines of code in the top left box of RStudio
Shift + Control (or Command) +P - Reruns previous region code
```

<br> <br>

#### Dplyr

```         
dplyr has many tools for data analysis   
select Choose which columns to include  
filter Filter the data 
arrange Sort the data, by size for continuous variables, by date, or alphabetically 
group_by Group the data by a categorical variable 
```

<br>

Build a simple summary table by Gender

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Gender, Salary) %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  summarize(Total = sum(Salary, na.rm=TRUE))
```

What is the sample size?

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  count(Gender) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Better idea: Check Averages!


```{r}
#Using the example code above, create a column called Avg_Salary and use the mean command to produce the calculation
#Adapt the code below to do this:

# MediaBucks %>% 
#   select(Gender, Salary) %>% 
#   group_by(Gender) %>% 
#   summarize(Total = sum(Salary, na.rm=TRUE))



```

Quick filter out hourly workers

```{r}
MediaSalary <- MediaBucks %>% 
  filter(Salary >= 1000)
```

Questions:

```         
1: View the range of your salary data    
2: Number of rows  
3: Number of rows cut with filter of greater that 500 
```

<br>

#### Find Your News Organization

Filter

```{r}
WSJ <- subset(MediaBucks, COMPANY=="WallStreetJournal")  
```

```{r}
summary(WSJ$Salary)
```

Using Wildcards

```{r}
Journal <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?Journal", COMPANY))
```

```{r}
Bloom <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?Bloomberg", COMPANY))
```

Questions

```         
1: Build a table for NewYorkTimes employees   
2: Determine median salary of NewYorkTimes employees   
3: Identify title, gender and race of the highest paid position at NYT   
4: Compare "Business" salaries to those at "Bloomberg"   
```

```{r}
#1: Build a table for NewYorkTimes employees   


```


```{r}
#2: Determine median salary of NewYorkTimes employees   


```

```{r}
#3: Identify title, gender and race of the highest paid position at NYT  


```

```{r}
#4: Build a table that filters "Business" in the Company column. Determine Summary of the Salary column.
#Build a second table that filters "Bloomberg" in the Company column.  Determine Summary of the Salary column.

#Which one is higher?


```


<br> \#### More Tables

Build a table with several companies of your choice

```{r}
BigBoys <- filter(MediaSalary, COMPANY %in% c("NewYorkTimes", "WallStreetJournal", "Bloomberg"))    
```

Table with just reporter salaries

```{r}
Reporters <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?reporter", TITLE))
summary(Reporters$Salary)
```

Questions:

```         
1: Who is making $230,504 as a reporter???   
2: Make a table for editors, figure out medians.   
3: Find highest paid editor. Resent them.   
4: Make a table for any position involving data  
```

Table with Black reporters at Wall Street Journal

```{r}
WSJ_Black <- MediaBucks %>% filter(Race =="black", COMPANY == "WallStreetJournal")
```

Build a simple summary table by Race

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Race, Salary) %>% 
  group_by(Race) %>% 
  summarize(Avg_Salary = mean(Salary, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Avg_Salary))
```

Wait! What are the totals by race?

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  count(Race) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Advanced: Build a summary table and count by race

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Race, Salary) %>% 
 group_by(Race) %>% 
  summarize(Total=n(),
            Avg = mean(Salary, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))

#### Install R and R Studio

This is free and open source software. It is not large and doesn't tax
the memory a lot. R runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, but this course is
designed for the Mac version. If you use Windows, there may be
variations in the lessons and instructions. Please see me for questions.
Installing R is a two-step process:

1)  Install R, the actual program

<https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/>

Accept all of the default settings.

2)  Install RStudio. This is the graphical interface we use to manage
    and create R code. Download the open source edition of R Studio
    desktop and follow the prompts to install it.

Download R Studio:
<https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>"
