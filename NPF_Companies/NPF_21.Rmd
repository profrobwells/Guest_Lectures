## SEC Filings: The Basics  

SEC History: Depression-era agency to police stock market. Required system of information disclosures so investors and public will understand risks. Self-policing concept backed up by civil enforcement powers.   

Every publicly traded company files annual reports, proxy statements, and periodic disclosures about their finances and major business developments.

+ Long-standing relationships with Yahoo!, Google and Microsoft Online     
+ April 30, 2020: 64 full-time employees      
+ Web site address is www.inuvo.com     
+ "The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition."    

**Red Flag**   
  1) *"material adverse impact" is a major warning of a significant business risk.*

>**More from Inuvo 10-K**     
  + "Beginning in late April 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in demand (marketing budgets) within the ValidClick business."      
  + "We would expect to see less advertising demand from the travel, leisure and hospitality verticals."      
  + "Our auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern... We have sustained recurring losses from operations and have a net capital deficiency."     
  + Reliant upon Yahoo! and Google for most of our revenue. During 2019 they accounted for 64.4%, and 14.1% of our revenues, respectively.      
  
**More Red Flags**    
  1) *auditors warning about "ability to continue as a going concern" is a major warning about future survival*   
  2) *heavy reliance on two companies for 78.5% of revenues*

  + For the year ended December 31, 2019, we reported a net loss of $4,488,107 and net cash used in operating activities of $5,338,383.   

**More Red Flags**    
  1) *Right before the pandemic blew up, company went heavily in debt: $5 million loan*   
  2) *Scrambling to raise money: sold $1.5 million in stock in March-April*     
  3) *Inuvo lost $4.5 million in 2019*
