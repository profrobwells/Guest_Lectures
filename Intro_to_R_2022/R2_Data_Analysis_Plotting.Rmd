**Goals:**
    
    Use the tidyverse packages dplyr and ggplot2   
    Sort, filter, group, summarize, join, and visualize   
    Identify trends in your data.   

 
**Analysis of San Francisco Police Calls for Service Data**  

- **Here is the original dataset: 3,048,797 records**  

https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Calls-for-Service/hz9m-tj6z/data

- **This tutorial uses a subset of this data** 

    The Calls for Service were filtered as follows: 
    CONTAINS homeless, 915, 919, 920: Downloaded 157,237 records 3/31/16 to 11/30/2019. 
    This is 5.1% of all calls in the broader database.
    File renamed to: SF_311_Jan29.xlsx   
   


# Part 1: Load Software, Interview Data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```



Load Data
```{r}
#At Home: See Appendix to load data at home from Internet

SF <- rio::import("SF_311_Jan29.xlsx", which = "SF Police_Department_Calls_for_") 
```

-- **Interview the Data**
```{r}
head(SF)
#view(SF)
```

-- **Really Interview the Data**
How big are you? Rows? Columns? List of column names? 

```{r}
nrow(SF)
```

```{r}
ncol(SF)
```

```{r}
glimpse(SF)
```

- **Clean column names, Process dates** 
```{r}
SF <- janitor::clean_names(SF)
#Process dates
SF$call_date2 <- ymd(SF$call_date)
SF$year <- year(SF$call_date2)
```

-- **Sort by Date**
```{r}
#descending order
SF1 <- SF %>% arrange(desc(report_date))
head(SF1)
```

```{r}
#ascending order
SF1 <- SF %>% arrange(report_date)
head(SF1)
```

- **311 Calls by Year**
```{r}
Years <- SF %>% 
  count(year) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))
head(Years)
```

## Basic ggplot

-- **ggplot to the rescue**

```{r}
ggplot(data=Years) +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=year, y=n)) 

```

-- **Add some color: fill**

```{r}
ggplot(data=Years) +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=year, y=n, fill=n)) 

```

-- **Ditch the legend**
```{r}

ggplot(Years,aes(x = year, y = n,
             fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

-- **Headlines, Annotations and Credits**
```{r}

ggplot(Years,aes(x = year, y = n,
             fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
#This is your title sequence
  labs(title = "311 Calls for Service By Day, San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data, 2016-2019",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 2-12-2022",
       y="Number of Calls",
       x="Year")
```


```{r}
#Adapting code from above...
SF %>% 
   count(year) %>% 
   group_by(year) %>% 
#Sandwich it onto a simple ggplot
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "311 Calls for Service By Year, San Francisco", 
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data, 2016-2019",
       caption = "Graphic by Wells",
       y="Number of Calls",
       x="Year")
```


- **311 Calls per Day**
Using count to tabulate and group the calls by day
```{r}
Days <- SF %>% 
  count(call_date2) %>% 
  group_by(call_date2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
head(Days)
```

-- **Quick Plot, Calls by Year**


```{r}
#Adapting code from above...
SF %>% 
  count(call_date2) %>% 
  group_by(call_date2) %>% 
#Sandwich it onto a simple ggplot
  ggplot(aes(x = call_date2, y = n, fill = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "311 Calls for Service By Day, San Francisco", 
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data, 2016-2019",
       caption = "Graphic by Wells",
       y="Number of Calls",
       x="Day")
```

- **Interviewing: Types of Crimes**
```{r}
SF1 <- SF %>% count(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
  group_by(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
head(SF1)
#view(SF1)
```


- **Interviewing: Actions Taken**
```{r}
Action <- SF %>% 
  count(disposition) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
head(Action)
#view(Action)
```
# Part 2: Analysis


- **Summary**: Using the summary() function, describe the minimum, maximum, median and mean of calls in the Days table
```{r}
summary(Days)
```

Between March 31, 2016 and Nov. 30, 2019, San Francisco residents placed **an average 117 calls** to police complaining about homeless people.

- **Question**: Identify the day with the most calls? The day had the least?
```{r}
Days %>% 
  filter(n == 232)
```

```{r}
Days %>% 
  filter(n == 10)
```

-- **Tabulate types of events**

```{r}
Types <- SF %>% count(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
  group_by(original_crime_type_name) 
head(Types)

#View(Types)
```

-- **Question**: What are the top five complaints in this data and provide the number of complaints

```{r}
#Start with same code as above
Types <- SF %>% count(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
  group_by(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
#Add this line to sort in descending order
  arrange(desc(n))
head(Types)
```

-- **Top 5**   
Create separate table with just the top five counties' crime rate: "top_n" function 
```{r}
SF %>% 
  count(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
  top_n(5, n) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```
-- **Export to spreadsheet**
```{r}
write.csv(Days,"Days.csv")
```

# Part 3: Visualization

- **Question**: What were the common days for arrests?

- **Task: Tabulate complaints by day of the week**  

https://github.com/profrobwells/Data-Analysis-Class-Jour-405v-5003/blob/master/Readings/dealing-with-dates.pdf

```{r}
SF <- SF %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(call_date, label=TRUE, abbr=FALSE))
```

```{r}
SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) 
```

Make an ugly bubble chart
```{r}
  #using the code above
SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) %>%
  
#and sandwich onto a graphic
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = n, color = n))
```


-- **Clean up bubble chart**

    We add y-axis label, headline & ditch the legend

```{r}
  #using the code above
SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) %>%
#and sandwiching onto a graphic
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n)) +
  ylab("Arrests") +
  geom_point(aes(size = n, color = n), alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Homeless Arrests By Weekday in San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data 2017-2019: Source: SFPD",
       caption = "Graphic by Wells")
```

-- **Pretty Bubble Chart**

    Scaled y axis: scale_y_continuous
    Bumped up bubble size: scale_size_area
    saved chart to object: bubble

```{r}
  #using the code above
bubble <- SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) %>%
#and sandwiching onto a graphic
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n)) +
  ylab("Arrests") +
  xlab("") +
  geom_point(aes(size = n, color = n), alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_size_area(guide = "none", max_size = 25) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 100)) +
  labs(title = "Homeless Arrests By Weekday in San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data 2017-2019: Source: SFPD",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 2/12/2022")
bubble
```

-- **Export to Hi Res File**
```{r}
ggsave("bubble.png",device = "png",width=9,height=6, dpi=800)
```
