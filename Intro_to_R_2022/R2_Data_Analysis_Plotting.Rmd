**Goals:**
    
    Use the tidyverse packages dplyr and ggplot2   
    Sort, filter, group, summarize, join, and visualize   
    Identify trends in your data.   

 
**Analysis of San Francisco Police Calls for Service Data**  

- **Here is the original dataset: 3,048,797 records**  

https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Calls-for-Service/hz9m-tj6z/data

    311 logs calls on general non-emergency issues ranging from blocked sidewalks to graffiti to homeless concerns. Details: https://support.datasf.org/help/311-case-data-faq

- **This tutorial uses a subset of this data** 

    The Calls for Service were filtered as follows: 
    CONTAINS homeless, 915, 919, 920: Downloaded 157,237 records 3/31/16 to 11/30/2019. 
    This is 5.1% of all calls in the broader database.
    File renamed to: SF_311_Jan29.xlsx   
   


# Part 1: Load Software, Interview Data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#background on tidyverse: https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```



Load Data
```{r}
#At Home: See Appendix to load data at home from Internet

SF <- rio::import("SF_311_Jan29.xlsx", which = "SF Police_Department_Calls_for_") 
```

-- **Interview the Data**
```{r}
head(SF)
#view(SF)
```

-- **Really Interview the Data**
How big are you? Rows? Columns? List of column names? 

```{r}
nrow(SF)
```

```{r}
ncol(SF)
```

```{r}
glimpse(SF)
```

- **Clean column names, Process dates** 
```{r}
#This cleans column names
SF <- janitor::clean_names(SF)
#This processes dates for analysis
SF$call_date2 <- ymd(SF$call_date)
#This creates a new column for year
SF$year <- year(SF$call_date2)
```

-- **Sort by Date**
```{r}
#descending order
SF1 <- SF %>% arrange(desc(report_date))
head(SF1)
```

```{r}
#ascending order
SF1 <- SF %>% arrange(report_date)
head(SF1)
```

- **311 Calls by Year**
```{r}
Years <- SF %>% 
  count(year) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))
head(Years)
```

## Basic ggplot

-- **Graph Years using ggplot**

```{r}
ggplot(data=Years) +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=year, y=n)) 

```

-- **That's ugly. Add some color: fill= **

```{r}
ggplot(data=Years) +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=year, y=n, fill=n)) 

```

-- **Ditch the legend**
```{r}

ggplot(Years,aes(x = year, y = n,
             fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

-- **Add Headlines, Annotations and Credits**
```{r}

ggplot(Years,aes(x = year, y = n,
             fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
#This is your title sequence
  labs(title = "311 Calls for Service By Day, San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data, 2016-2019",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 2-12-2022",
       y="Number of Calls",
       x="Year")
```

-- **Filter a dataset, build a chart in one code block**

```{r}
#Copy section of code from above...
SF %>% 
   count(year) %>% 
   group_by(year) %>% 
#Sandwich it onto a simple ggplot
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "311 Calls for Service By Year, San Francisco", 
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data, 2016-2019",
       caption = "Graphic by Wells",
       y="Number of Calls",
       x="Year")
```


- **Which Day Had the Most 311 Calls?**
Using count to tabulate calls by day
```{r}
Days <- SF %>% 
  count(call_date2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

head(Days)
```

-- **Chart Calls by Day**


```{r}
#Adapting code from above...
SF %>% 
  count(call_date2) %>% 
#Sandwich it onto a simple ggplot
  ggplot(aes(x = call_date2, y = n, fill = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "311 Calls for Service By Day, San Francisco", 
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data, 2016-2019",
       caption = "Graphic by Wells",
       y="Number of Calls",
       x="Day")
```

- **Interviewing: Types of Crimes**
```{r}
SF1 <- SF %>% count(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
head(SF1)
#view(SF1)
```


- **Interviewing: Actions Taken**
```{r}
Action <- SF %>% 
  count(disposition) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
head(Action)
#view(Action)
```
# Part 2: Analysis


- **Summary**: Using the summary() function, describe the minimum, maximum, median and mean of calls in the Days table
```{r}
summary(Days)
```

Between March 31, 2016 and Nov. 30, 2019, San Francisco residents placed **an average 117 calls** to police complaining about homeless people.

- **Question**: Identify the day with the most calls? 
```{r}
#Group_by gathers and allows tabulation of all days
Days %>%
  group_by(call_date2) %>% 
  filter(n == max(n)) 
```

```{r}
#See what happens without group_by - only the top value is computed, not the aggregation of the component parts
Days %>%
  # group_by(call_date2) %>% 
  filter(n == max(n)) 

```

<br>   
<br> 

- **Question**: Identify the top 5 days with the most calls?
```{r}

Days %>% 
   slice_max(n, n = 5)
#slice_max to the rescue: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html

#Or
#Filter by the value
# Days %>% 
#   filter(n == 232)
```

- **Question**: Identify the top 5 days with the fewest calls?
```{r}
Days %>% 
   slice_min(n, n = 5)
#Or
#Filter by the value
# Days %>% 
#   filter(n == 10)
```

-- **Tabulate types of events**: What are the top five complaints in this data and provide the number of complaints

```{r}
#Start with same code as above
Types <- SF %>% count(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
  slice_max(n, n=5)
Types
```

-- **Export to spreadsheet**
```{r}
write.csv(Days,"Days.csv")
```

# Part 3: Visualization

- **Question**: What were the common days for arrests?

- **Task: Tabulate complaints by day of the week**  

https://github.com/profrobwells/Data-Analysis-Class-Jour-405v-5003/blob/master/Readings/dealing-with-dates.pdf

```{r}
SF <- SF %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(call_date, label=TRUE, abbr=FALSE))
```

```{r}
SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) 

#grepl, your find function: searches for matches of a string, returns true or false. "grep logical"

```

Make an ugly bubble chart
```{r}
  #using the code above
SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) %>%
  
#and sandwich onto a graphic
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = n, color = n))
```


-- **Clean up bubble chart**

    We add y-axis label, headline & ditch the legend

```{r}
  #using the code above
SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) %>%
#and sandwiching onto a graphic
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n)) +
  ylab("Arrests") +
  geom_point(aes(size = n, color = n), alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Homeless Arrests By Weekday in San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data 2017-2019: Source: SFPD",
       caption = "Graphic by Wells")
```

-- **Pretty Bubble Chart**

    Scaled y axis: scale_y_continuous
    Bumped up bubble size: scale_size_area
    saved chart to object: bubble

```{r}
  #using the code above
bubble <- SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) %>%
#and sandwiching onto a graphic
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n)) +
  ylab("Arrests") +
  xlab("") +
  geom_point(aes(size = n, color = n), alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_size_area(guide = "none", max_size = 25) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 100)) +
  labs(title = "Homeless Arrests By Weekday in San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data 2017-2019: Source: SFPD",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 2/12/2022")
bubble
```

-- **Export to Hi Res File**
```{r}
ggsave("bubble.png",device = "png",width=9,height=6, dpi=800)
```
