#### Analysis of San Francisco Police Calls for Service Data

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="./assets/images/bubble.png" width="700" height="600"/>
:::

##### Here is [the original dataset: 3,048,797 records](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Calls-for-Service/hz9m-tj6z/data)

```         
311 logs calls on general non-emergency issues ranging from blocked sidewalks to graffiti to homeless concerns. Details: https://support.datasf.org/help/311-case-data-faq
```

**This tutorial uses a subset of this data**

```         
The Calls for Service were filtered as follows:  
CONTAINS homeless, 915, 919, 920: Downloaded 157,237 records 3/31/16 to 11/30/2019. 
This is 5.1% of all calls in the broader database.
File renamed to: SF_311_Jan29.xlsx   
```

## Part 1: Load Software, Interview Data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#background on tidyverse: https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/
#load tidyverse and janitor libraries

#library XXXXXX fill it in!
```

**Load Data**

```{r}
SF <- rio::import("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-nkosLJKkfeLSl-UG82DDyiEw5-62kX2alS6ICG9iuk/edit#gid=552005485", sheet = "SF Police_Department_Calls_for_") 
```

**Interview the Data**

```{r}
#display the first six rows of SF using head
```

**Really Interview the Data** How big are you? Rows? Columns? List of
column names?

```{r}
#examine all of the SF data using glimpse
```

**Clean column names, Process dates**

```{r}
#This cleans column names
SF <- janitor::clean_names(SF)
#This processes dates for analysis
SF$call_date2 <- mdy(SF$call_date)
#This creates a new column for year
SF$year <- year(SF$call_date2)
```

**Sort by Date**

```         
We're using a weirdo command called a 'pipe' - %>% - that joins
lines of code. In the example below, the SF table is filtered in descending order and the results are dumped into a new file called SF1.
```

```{r}
#descending order
SF1 <- SF %>% 
arrange(desc(report_date))
#head(SF1)
```

**Create a Table: 311 Calls by Year**

```{r}
Years <- SF %>% 
  count(year) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))
head(Years)
```

<br>

## Part 2: Basic ggplot

**Graph Years using ggplot**

```{r}
ggplot(data=Years) +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=year, y=n)) 

```

**That's ugly. Add some color: fill=n**

```{r}
ggplot(data=Years) +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=year, y=n, fill=n)) 

```

**Ditch the legend: theme(legend.position = "none")**

```{r}

ggplot(Years,aes(x = year, y = n,
             fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

**Add Headlines, Annotations and Credits: labs(title =**

```{r}

ggplot(Years,aes(x = year, y = n,
             fill = n)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
#This is your title sequence
  labs(title = "311 Calls for Service By Day, San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data, 2016-2019",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 2-12-2022",
       y="Number of Calls",
       x="Year")
```

**Filter a dataset, build a chart in one code block**

```{r}
#Copy section of code from above...
# SF %>% 
#    count(year) %>% 
#    group_by(year) %>% 
#Sandwich it onto a simple ggplot that you created in the prior code chunk
  
```

<br>

### Your Turn

**1) Which Day Had the Most 311 Calls?** Using count to tabulate calls
by day

```{r}

```

**2) Chart Calls by Day** Use the code above and add a ggplot chart to
it

```{r}

```

<br>

# Part 3: Analysis

**Summary**: Using the summary() function, describe the minimum,
maximum, median and mean of calls in the Days table

```{r}
#Adding the $n allows us to calculate the data on a specific column
Days <- SF %>% 
  count(call_date2) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

summary(Days$n)
```

Between March 31, 2016 and Nov. 30, 2019, San Francisco residents placed
**an average 117 calls** to police complaining about homeless people.

**Most Calls**: Identify the day with the most calls

```{r}
#Group_by gathers and allows tabulation of all days
Days %>%
  group_by(call_date2) %>% 
  filter(n == max(n)) 
```

**See what happens without group_by** Only the top value is computed,
not the aggregation of the component parts

```{r}

Days %>%
  # group_by(call_date2) %>% 
  filter(n == max(n)) 

```

**Export to spreadsheet**

```{r}
#write.csv(Days,"Days.csv")
```

<br>

### Your Turn

**Question**: Identify the top 5 days with the most calls? Pro tip:
[slice_max to the
rescue](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html)

```{r}

```

**Question**: Identify the top 5 days with the fewest calls?

Pro tip: [slice_min](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html)

```{r}


```

### Types of Complaints

**Interviewing: Types of Complaints**

```{r}
SF1 <- SF %>% count(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
head(SF1)
```

**Interviewing: Actions Taken**

```{r}
Action <- SF %>% 
  count(disposition) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
head(Action)
```

**Tabulate types of events**. What are the top five complaints in this
data and provide the number of complaints

```{r}
Types <- SF %>% count(original_crime_type_name) %>% 
  slice_max(n, n=5)
Types
```

<br>

# Part 4: Visualization

**Question**: What were the common days for arrests?

**Task: Tabulate arrests by day of the week**

[Background on dealing with
dates](https://github.com/profrobwells/Data-Analysis-Class-Jour-405v-5003/blob/master/Readings/dealing-with-dates.pdf)

```{r}
SF <- SF %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(call_date2, label=TRUE, abbr=FALSE))
```

```{r}
SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) 

#grepl, your find function: searches for matches of a string, returns true or false. "grep logical"

```

**Make an ugly bubble chart**

```{r}
  #using the code above
SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) %>%
  #and sandwich onto a graphic
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = n, color = n))
```

**Clean up bubble chart**

```         
We add y-axis label, headline & ditch the legend
```

```{r}
  #using the code above
SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) %>%
#and sandwiching onto a graphic
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n)) +
  ylab("Arrests") +
  geom_point(aes(size = n, color = n), alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Homeless Arrests By Weekday in San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data 2017-2019: Source: SFPD",
       caption = "Graphic by Wells")
```

**Refined Bubble Chart**

```         
Scaled y axis: scale_y_continuous
Bumped up bubble size: scale_size_area
saved chart to object: bubble
```

```{r}
  #using the code above
bubble <- SF %>%
  select(weekday, crime_id, disposition) %>%
  filter(grepl("ARR", disposition)) %>%
  count(weekday) %>%
#and sandwiching onto a graphic
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = n)) +
  ylab("Arrests") +
  xlab("") +
  geom_point(aes(size = n, color = n), alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_size_area(guide = "none", max_size = 25) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 100)) +
  labs(title = "Homeless Arrests By Weekday in San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data 2017-2019: Source: SFPD",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 5/24/2024")
bubble
```

**Export to Hi Res File**

```{r}
ggsave("bubble.png",device = "png",width=9,height=6, dpi=800)
```

# Part 5: Line Charts, Themes

** Make a line chart **
```{r}
Days |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = call_date2, y = n)) +
  ylab("Daily Calls") +
  xlab("") +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Daily Calls for Service in San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data 2017-2019: Source: SFPD",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 1/28/2025")

```

**Refine Line Chart**
Let's look at just the first six months of 2017
Add detail to the x-axis
```{r}
Days |> 
  filter(call_date2 >= "2017-01-01" & call_date2 <= "2017-06-30") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = call_date2, y = n)) +
  ylab("Daily Calls") +
  xlab("") +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b-%Y") +
  labs(title = "Daily Calls for Service in San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data 2017-2019: Source: SFPD",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 1/28/2025")

```

We set date_breaks to appear for every month. If you wanted breaks in weeks, date_breaks = "1 week". We can set the date to appear as
month abbreviated name (%b) and four-digit year (%Y).

### Themes

The ggplot universe is pretty big, and lots of people have made and
released cool themes for you to use. Here's a theme to make your graphics look kind of like [The Economist's](https://www.economist.com/).

First, install and load a package containing extra themes, called
[ggthemes](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/).

```{r}
#install.packages('ggthemes')
library(ggthemes)
```

And now we'll apply the economist theme from that package with
theme_economist()

```{r}
Days |> 
  filter(call_date2 >= "2017-01-01" & call_date2 <= "2017-06-30") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = call_date2, y = n)) +
  ylab("Daily Calls") +
  xlab("") +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b-%Y") +
  labs(title = "Daily Calls for Service in San Francisco",
       subtitle = "SF PD Service Call Data 2017-2019: Source: SFPD",
       caption = "Graphic by Rob Wells, 1/28/2025")+
   theme_economist()

```
