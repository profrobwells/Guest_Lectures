### Note:

```         
Nicar session organizers have installed this software on the session computers.
See the **"At Home"** notes on how to install the software and data on your personal or work computer so you can work on this lesson after the class
Directions for loading R and R Studio on your personal / work computers are at the end of this tutorial
```

<br> <br>

#### Get Organized

```{r}
#setwd("./Desktop/hands_on_classes/r_1_intro_to_r_and_rstudio_1083")
#At Home: Skip this step, since your computer doesn't have this folder.
#Instead, create a new folder on your Desktop or other convenient spot, call it R_Lessons, copy this file R 1_ Intro_to_R_RStudio_Wells_2022.Rmd into the folder, and then launch the file
```

<br> <br>

#### Orientation to R Studio

```         
There are four main windows:  

--Script writing, R Markdown, Table Viewer: Upper Left  
--Environment - data loaded in R: Upper Right  
--Console - write commands in R: Lower Left  
--File Manager and Html table viewer: Bottom Right  
```

<br>

Housekeeping

```{r}
# setwd("C:/Users/nmradmin/Desktop/hands_on_classes/20220305_r_1_intro_to_r_and_rstudio_saturday_repeat_3034")

```

**Chunks: The gray boxes have live R code. Click the green arrow at the
right on line 55 and run the help.start() command**

```{r}
help.start()
```

<br> <br>

#### Install software to grab data

```         
Tidyverse: Eight separate software packages to perform
data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and         programming

Rio: Easy importing features 
Janitor: Data cleaning
```

<br> **At Home:**

```         
Nicar session organizers have installed this software on the session computers.
If you are doing this lesson at home or elsewhere, 
delete the hashtag before install.packages and 
install the software on your personal or work computer
```

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("rio") 
#install.packages("janitor")
```

After you install a package on your hard drive, you can call it back up
by summoning a library

Libraries are bits of software you will have to load each time into R to
make things run.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(janitor)
```

Check to see what's installed by clicking on "Packages" tab in File
Manager, lower right pane <br>

#### Data

```         
Open this file in Excel:

./R1_Intro_R_RStudio_Wells/RealMediaSalariesCleaned.xlsx

1) Select RealMediaSalaries2 tab

IRE Old School: Four Corners Test!
13 Columns
1658 Rows

Numberic data in Salary, Years Experience
Mixed string data in Gender Identity / Ethnicity, Job duties
```

<br> <br>

#### Import Data

```{r}
MediaBucks <- rio::import("RealMediaSalariesCleaned.xlsx", which = "RealMediaSalaries2")

#At Home: See Appendix to load data at home from Internet
```

<br> What happened? Look at the table

```{r}
View(MediaBucks)
```

What happened?

R grabbed the spreadsheet from the folder\
We told R to grab the first sheet, RealMediaSalaries2\
R created a dataframe called MediaBucks\
basics of R: \<- is known as an “assignment operator.”\
It means: “Make the object named to the left equal to the output of the
code to the right.”

<br> <br>

#### Explore Data

How many rows?

```{r}
nrow(MediaBucks)
```

How many columns?

```{r}
ncol(MediaBucks)
```

Dimensions: Gives number rows, then columns

```{r}
dim(MediaBucks)
```

Names of your columns

```{r}
colnames(MediaBucks)
```

OR

```{r}
names(MediaBucks)
```

Check data types

```{r}
#During class, remove hashtag on next line and run chunk
#str(MediaBucks)
```

Let's look at the first six rows

```{r}
#During class, remove hashtag on next line and run chunk
#head(MediaBucks)
```

Here is a quick way to view the range of your data

```{r}
summary(MediaBucks$Salary)
```

Size and scope

```{r}
sum(MediaBucks$Salary, na.rm=TRUE)
```

\$106 million! for 1,658 journalists

Context: NYT earnings in 2022 = \$174 m Facebook profit for one day:
\$129 million (Q32023=\$11.6B)

average

```{r}
mean(MediaBucks$Salary, na.rm=TRUE)
```

Distribution

```{r}
quantile(MediaBucks$Salary, c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9), na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r}
quantile(MediaBucks$Salary, c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.9, 0.99), na.rm=TRUE)
```

<br>

#### Navigation Tips

```         
Shortcut Commands
Tab - Autocomplete
In Console Window (lower left) 
--Control (or Command) + UP arrow - last lines run
Control (or Command) + Enter - Runs current or selected lines of code in the top left box of RStudio
Shift + Control (or Command) +P - Reruns previous region code
```

<br> <br>

#### Dplyr

```         
dplyr has many tools for data analysis   
select Choose which columns to include  
filter Filter the data 
arrange Sort the data, by size for continuous variables, by date, or alphabetically 
group_by Group the data by a categorical variable 
```

<br>

Build a simple summary table by Gender

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Gender, Salary) %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  summarize(Total = sum(Salary, na.rm=TRUE))
```

What is the sample size?

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  count(Gender) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Better idea: Check Averages!

Build a simple summary table by Gender

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Gender, Salary) %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  summarize(Avg_Salary = mean(Salary, na.rm=TRUE))
```

Quick filter out hourly workers

```{r}
MediaSalary <- MediaBucks %>% 
  filter(Salary >= 1000)
```

Questions:

```         
1: View the range of your data    
2: Number of rows  
3: Number of rows cut with filter  
```

<br>

#### Find Your News Organization

Filter

```{r}
WSJ <- subset(MediaBucks, COMPANY=="WallStreetJournal")  
```

```{r}
summary(WSJ$Salary)
```

Using Wildcards

```{r}
Journal <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?Journal", COMPANY))
```

```{r}
Bloom <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?Bloomberg", COMPANY))
```

Questions

```         
1: Build a table for NewYorkTimes employees   
2: Determine median salary of NewYorkTimes employees   
3: Identify title, gender and race of the highest paid position at NYT   
4: Search for "Business" in Company, check salaries, compare to "Bloomberg"   
```

<br> \#### More Tables

Build a table with several companies of your choice

```{r}
BigBoys <- filter(MediaSalary, COMPANY %in% c("NewYorkTimes", "WallStreetJournal", "Bloomberg"))    
```

Table with just reporter salaries

```{r}
Reporters <- subset(MediaBucks, grepl("?reporter", TITLE))
summary(Reporters$Salary)
```

Questions:

```         
1: Who is making $230,504 as a reporter???   
2: Make a table for editors, figure out medians.   
3: Find highest paid editor. Resent them.   
4: Make a table for any position involving data  
```

Table with Black reporters at Wall Street Journal

```{r}
WSJ_Black <- MediaBucks %>% filter(Race =="black", COMPANY == "WallStreetJournal")
```

Build a simple summary table by Race

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Race, Salary) %>% 
  group_by(Race) %>% 
  summarize(Avg_Salary = mean(Salary, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Avg_Salary))
```

Wait! What are the totals by race?

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  count(Race) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Advanced: Build a summary table and count by race

```{r}
MediaBucks %>% 
  select(Race, Salary) %>% 
 group_by(Race) %>% 
  summarize(Total=n(),
            Avg = mean(Salary, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))

# Appendix

#### Install R and R Studio

This is free and open source software. It is not large and doesn't tax
the memory a lot. R runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, but this course is
designed for the Mac version. If you use Windows, there may be
variations in the lessons and instructions. Please see me for questions.
Installing R is a two-step process:

1)  Install R, the actual program

<https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/>

Accept all of the default settings.

2)  Install RStudio. This is the graphical interface we use to manage
    and create R code. Download the open source edition of R Studio
    desktop and follow the prompts to install it.

Download R Studio:
<https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>"

More detailed instructions for installing R and R Studio:
<http://www.machlis.com/R4Journalists/download-r-and-rstudio.html>

Here's a good overview of the program:

<br> <br>

#### Load Data for Tutorial At Home:

```         
If you are doing this tutorial at home on your personal machine, you can load spreadsheets from the Internet as follows:
```

```{r}
#remove hashtag in front of MediaBucks. Colors change to black and you can run the chunk

#MediaBucks <- rio::import("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SP3Sqqdv6R8chFamjtgdNlOrUar-hJXvkMSeha2mHQ8/edit#gid=0", which = "Salaries", skip = 3)
```
